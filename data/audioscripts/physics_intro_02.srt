[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.760] Okay,
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.180] welcome
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.560] everyone.
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.880] Welcome
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.280] back
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.660] to

[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.520].225,
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.080] which
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.220] is
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.540] also
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.160] STS
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.180]-042,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.320] Physics
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.640] in
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.760] the
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.120] 20th
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.380] Century.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.820] Let
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.900] me
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.080] start
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.240] by
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.420] asking
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.580] just
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.820] quickly,
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.940] if
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.000] there
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.040] are
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.160] any
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.680] logistical
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.380] questions,
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.520] any
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.940] kind
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.040] of

[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.680] structure,
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.920] other
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.260] questions
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.420] like
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.700] that,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.360] we
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.460] can
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.620] try
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.740] to
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.920] clear
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.060] up
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.320] quickly
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.420] and
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.500] then
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.580] we'll
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.780] jump
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.960] into
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.180] the
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.560] first
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.800] main
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.120] lecture.
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.520] In
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.840] general,
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.020] it's
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.160] good
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.440] to
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.740] do
[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.880] the
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.100] readings,
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.300] at
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.460] least
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.640] to
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.920] skim
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.080] the
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.260] more
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.540] technical
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.920] readings
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.400] before
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.900] the
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.260] assigned
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.360] class.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.060] So
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.220] for
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.440] today,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.660] that
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.820] was
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.980] a
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.240] brief
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.660] excerpt
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.900] from
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.540] Maxwell's
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.840] Treatise
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.940] on
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.280] Electricity
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.360] and
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.660] Magnetism,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.820] for
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.140] example,
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.740] and
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.860] a
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.120] chapter
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.340] from
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.560] Bruce
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.860] Hunt's
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.040] book
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.160] on
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.260] the
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.840] Maxwellians.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.520] So
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.900] in
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.140] general,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.260] it'll
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.320] be
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.580] helpful
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.740] if
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.780] you
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.040] keep
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.280] up,
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.500] if
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.040] students
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.300] keep
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.440] up
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.520] with
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.600] the
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.920] readings,
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.660] because
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.160] it's
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.280] just
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.360] going
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.460] to
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.720] snowball.
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.160] Otherwise,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.260] some
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.340] of
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.420] the
[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.660] readings,
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.000] as
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.280] you
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.600] probably
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.960] have
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.280] noted,
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.840] with
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.960] the
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.200] Maxwell
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.360] in
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.700] particular,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.580] are
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.180] pretty,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.000] they're
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.160] not
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.500] exactly
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.680] a
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.940] page
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.260]-turning
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.680] novel,
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.960] right?
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.120] Like
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.480] what's
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.640] going
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.780] on
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.920] with
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.060] that?
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.780] So
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.940] I'm
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.940] going
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.020] to
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.220] be
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.520] talking
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.940] about
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.180] what
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.460] Maxwell
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.780] thought
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.920] he
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.040] was
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.200] doing,
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.360] what
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.500] some
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.620] of
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.020] Maxwell's
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.600] contemporaries,
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.120] how
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.340] they
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.620] read
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.880] that
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.180] book
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.820] in
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.120] today's
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.420] lecture.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.740] So
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.960] for
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.180] that,
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.740] so
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.040] today
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.320] might,
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.820] hopefully
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.980] will
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.640] exemplify
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.820] the
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.140] kind
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.280] of
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.020] use
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.580] to
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.800] make
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.920] of
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.140] readings
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.360] like
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.580] that
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.780] as
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.880] we
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.000] go
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.280] through
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.480] the
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.620] kind
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.720] of
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.000] first
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.260] worked
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.660] example
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.880] with
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.200] Maxwell
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.620] today.
[00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.250] Other
[00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.630] readings,
[00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.890] as
[00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.150] you'll
[00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.370] see,
[00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.710] like
[00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.070] the
[00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.330] chapter
[00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.550] from
[00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.750] Bruce
[00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.970] Hunt
[00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.130] for
[00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.330] this
[00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.810] week,
[00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.370] are
[00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.830] by
[00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.730] physicists
[00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.990] or
[00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.510] historians

[00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.470] or
[00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.730] other
[00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.310] more
[00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.570] recent
[00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.050] scholars
[00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.570] trying
[00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.710] to
[00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.970] help
[00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.150] us
[00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.370] make
[00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.670] sense
[00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.830] of
[00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.990] that
[00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.250] older
[00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.690] work.
[00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.250] And
[00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.370] for
[00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.710] those,
[00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.590] I
[00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.670] think
[00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.770] it
[00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.910] does
[00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.050] make

[00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.590] them
[00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.710] a
[00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.830] bit
[00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.230] more
[00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.570] closely.
[00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.950] What's
[00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.050] the
[00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.330] actual
[00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.830] argument
[00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.010] the
[00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.430] author's
[00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.750] making?
[00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.010] What
[00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.110] are
[00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.210] the
[00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.450] kinds
[00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.630] of
[00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.010] evidence
[00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.250] does

[00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.250] bear?
[00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.990] Because
[00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.130] what
[00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.210] we'll
[00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.410] work
[00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.570] on
[00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.870] together
[00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.170] over
[00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.330] the
[00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.650] course
[00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.770] of
[00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.830] the
[00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.190] semester
[00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.890] is
[00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.130] actually
[00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.630] working
[00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.890] on
[00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.030] your
[00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.450] own
[00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.870] written
[00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.350] essays,
[00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.550] your
[00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.710] own
[00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.210] analyses,
[00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.030] where
[00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.150] you
[00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.310] will
[00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.490] be,
[00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.710] will
[00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.990] help
[00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.110] you,
[00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.230] will
[00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.450] build
[00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.590] up
[00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.830] toward
[00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.130] it.
[00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.710] But
[00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.810] you'll
[00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.910] be
[00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.190] working
[00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.750] on
[00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.570] articulating
[00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.950] an
[00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.390] argument,
[00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.190] defending
[00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.370] an
[00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.630] argument
[00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.850] with
[00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.170] evidence
[00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.310] and
[00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.750] examples
[00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.010] from
[00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.370] various
[00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.770] sources.
[00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.350] So
[00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.750] those,
[00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.530] the
[00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.770] readings
[00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.870] that
[00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.930] we
[00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.070] would
[00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.290] call
[00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.470] a
[00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.870] secondary
[00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.410] source,
[00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.790] readings
[00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.750] by
[00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.750] historians
[00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.170] or
[00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.550] more
[00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.830] recent
[00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.210] physicists
[00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.490] or
[00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.910] philosophers
[00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.130] or
[00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.590] sociologists
[00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.790] or
[00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.050] journalists
[00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.190] or
[00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.550] whomever,
[00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.650] those
[00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.950] are
[00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.410] more
[00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.650] like
[00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.770] the
[00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.990] kinds
[00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.110] of
[00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.390] writings
[00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.610] we're
[00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.630] going
[00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.690] to
[00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.810] try
[00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.910] to
[00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.050] do
[00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.210] ourselves
[00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.450] over
[00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.570] the
[00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.750] course
[00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.870] of
[00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.970] the
[00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.290] term.
[00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.890] So
[00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.090] I'd
[00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.310] recommend,
[00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.610] plus
[00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.750] I
[00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.930] think
[00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.270] hopefully
[00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.430] they're
[00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.670] interesting,
[00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.930] I've
[00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.130] chosen
[00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.490] very
[00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.470] carefully.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.600] So
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.740] I
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.860] do
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.160] recommend
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.300] you
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.420] try
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.520] to
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.680] read
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.880] those
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.040] a
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.200] bit
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.920] differently,
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.320] let's
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.580] say,
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.020] than
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.240] something
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.480] like
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.860] skimming
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.160] over
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.700] Maxwell's
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.040] treatise,
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.240] which
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.680] might
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.960] look
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.240] both
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.540] pretty
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.040] bland
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.420] and
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.780] weird
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.060] and
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.140] a
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.300] little
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.120] unusual
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.440] given
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.640] how
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.780] we
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.920] do
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.140] things
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.480] today.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.080] So
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.220] there
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.360] are
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.540] kind
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.640] of
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.900] different
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.200] ways
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.360] to
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.520] read
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.620] the
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.060] different
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.340] kinds
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.480] of
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.820] sources.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.360] And
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.440] I
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.540] guess
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.620] I
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.800] hopefully
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.080] today
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.280] we'll
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.520] actually
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.980] give
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.100] a
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.220] bit
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.300] of
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.400] an
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.740] example
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.900] of
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.000] that
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.120] as
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.340] we
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.700] talk
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.120] a
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.220] little
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.360] bit
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.640] about
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.460] that
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.780] Maxwell
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.120] reading
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.240] throughout
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.600] today.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.580] So
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.840] that's
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.940] the
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.320] plan.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.060] And
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.180] if
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.280] there's
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.580] no
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.920] other
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.280] questions,
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.440] I
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.560] think
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.660] we'll
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.800] just
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.040] jump
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.200] right
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.400] in.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.500] So
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.700] I'm
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.760] going
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.820] to
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.940] go
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.080] ahead
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.180] and
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.380] share
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.800] screen.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.460] And
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.920] hopefully
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.380] you
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.160] can
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.300] see
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.440] that
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.660] first
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.960] slide.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.640] So
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.980] today
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.200] we're
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.260] going
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.380] to
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.660] start
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.840] our
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.040] kind
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.180] of

[00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.700] in
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.200] earnest.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.920] We're
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.980] going
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.160] to
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.460] turn
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.620] the
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.880] clock
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.220] back
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.620] about

[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.820] years
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.020] and
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.120] talk
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.460] about
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.660] some
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.760] of
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.880] the
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.400] leading
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.660] natural
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.200] philosophers,
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.400] some
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.480] of
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.540] the
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.820] leading
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.760] people
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.900] who
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.980] are
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.180] trying
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.320] to
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.860] understand
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.140] the
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.380] physical
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.900] world.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.900] And
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.060] what
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.200] did
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.400] they
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.600] think
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.760] their
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.060] job
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.420] was?
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.620] What
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.740] were
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.880] the
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.200] settings
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.360] in
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.500] which
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.660] they
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.860] did
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.000] it?
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.380] What
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.520] were
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.760] the
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.240] conceptual
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.720] tools
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.900] they
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.100] brought
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.300] to
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.560] bear?
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.040] And
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.160] we'll
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.300] always
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.420] be
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.600] asking
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.940] ourselves
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.280] what
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.580] looks
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.780] kind
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.880] of
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.140] similar
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.320] and
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.440] what
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.660] looks
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.100] really,
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.440] really
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.600] unfamiliar
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.340] from
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.520] our
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.800] vantage
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.060] point
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.380] today.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.540] So
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.840] the
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.840] discussion
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.060] today
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.220] has
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.460] three
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.780] main
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.380] sections.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.860] We
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.940] have
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.080] a
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.420] brief
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.720] kind
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.840] of
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.260] warm
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.540]-up
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.960] on
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.300] physics
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.600] then
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.760] and
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.200] now,
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.700] just
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.840] to
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.020] try
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.260] to
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.620] prep
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.920] us
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.120] to
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.280] put
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.400] our
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.660] minds
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.980] back
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.240] into
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.540] the
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.900] world
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.060] of
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.160] the
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.400] early
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.900] 19th
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.240] century.
[00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.410] Then
[00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.970] we'll
[00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.310] spend
[00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.430] a
[00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.510] bit
[00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.610] of
[00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.730] time
[00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.910] talking
[00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.090] about
[00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.370] Michael
[00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.990] Faraday,
[00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.170] who
[00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.310] was
[00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.470] one
[00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.530] of
[00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.630] the
[00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.170] most
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.320] widely
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.940] celebrated
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.820] scientists
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.100] or
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.420] natural
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.860] philosophers
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.080] of
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.220] his
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.540] day.
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.440] And
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.580] we'll
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.820] see
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.040] some
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.100] of
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.200] the
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.360] things
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.460] that
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.540] he
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.000] introduced
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.820] during
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.160] his
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.540] rather
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.900] unusual
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.280] career.
[00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.630] And
[00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.810] then
[00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.010] the
[00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.310] last
[00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.550] main
[00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.930] section
[00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.050] for
[00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.230] today,
[00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.390] we'll
[00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.610] talk
[00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.810] about
[00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.010] some
[00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.070] of
[00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.170] the
[00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.410] folks
[00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.530] who
[00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.610] were
[00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.750] a
[00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.790] bit
[00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.090] younger
[00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.350] than
[00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.910] Faraday,
[00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.490] who
[00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.670] kind
[00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.790] of
[00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.010] took
[00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.210] up
[00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.410] his
[00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.850] mantle,
[00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.010] who
[00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.190] tried
[00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.350] to
[00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.730] continue
[00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.030] his
[00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.290] line
[00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.430] of
[00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.710] work,
[00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.170] but
[00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.430] again,
[00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.730] using
[00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.030] some
[00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.630] different
[00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.970] kinds
[00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.130] of
[00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.450] techniques
[00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.710] and
[00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.050] tools.
[00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.490] In
[00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.650] this
[00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.850] case,
[00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.470] William
[00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.890] Thomson
[00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:13.190] and
[00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.390] James
[00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.590] Clerk
[00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.970] Maxwell.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.620] So
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.860] that's
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.080] our
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.360] kind
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.440] of
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.820] goal
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.020] for
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.300] today.
[00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.830] So
[00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.070] let's
[00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.290] just
[00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.610] pause
[00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.830] and
[00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.270] remember
[00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.610] that
[00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.830] we
[00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.210] are
[00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.010] entering
[00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.270] a
[00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.490] kind
[00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.670] of
[00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.490] imaginary
[00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.010] time
[00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.430] capsule
[00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.050] and
[00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.230] going
[00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.610] back
[00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.490] about
[00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.950] 200
[00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.290] years
[00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.490] to
[00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.770] start.
[00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.470] So
[00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.630] the
[00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.950] assumptions
[00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.190] that
[00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.330] we
[00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.590] might
[00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.910] bring
[00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:29.230] in
[00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.770] as
[00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.590] physics
[00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.010] students,
[00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.190] as
[00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.430] MIT
[00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.790] students
[00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.010] more
[00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.410] generally,
[00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.370] about
[00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.670] how
[00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.870] the
[00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.070] world
[00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.450] works,
[00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.670] about
[00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.910] what
[00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:35.150] the
[00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.430] job
[00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.530] of
[00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.670] a
[00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.890] physicist
[00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:36.370] is,
[00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.530] and
[00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.710] so
[00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.950] on,
[00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.730] those
[00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.130] won't
[00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.570] map
[00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.950] on
[00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.370] perfectly
[00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.810] well
[00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.270] to
[00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.450] some
[00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.510] of
[00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.630] these
[00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.930] earlier
[00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.270] folks
[00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.450] we're
[00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.490] going
[00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.490] to
[00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.630] start
[00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.950] talking
[00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.150] about.
[00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.910] And
[00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.030] I
[00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.490] find
[00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.710] that
[00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.090] that's
[00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.230] part
[00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.290] of
[00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.450] what's
[00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.590] so
[00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.810] fun
[00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.990] for
[00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.090] me
[00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.330] about
[00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.650] working
[00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.770] in
[00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.830] the
[00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.990] history
[00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.110] of
[00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.370] science,
[00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.530] is
[00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.870] exactly
[00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.050] those
[00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.270] moments
[00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.430] where
[00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.590] things
[00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.990] don't
[00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.150] look
[00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.350] so
[00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.670] familiar,
[00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.310] as
[00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.410] well
[00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.530] as
[00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.630] the
[00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.130] continuities
[00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.310] we
[00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.490] can
[00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.770] trace
[00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.970] over
[00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.350] time.
[00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.330] So
[00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.450] one
[00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.490] of
[00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.570] the
[00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.770] biggest
[00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.110] questions
[00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.250] we
[00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.410] might
[00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.810] ask
[00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.510] about
[00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.310] physics
[00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.650] today
[00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.830] is,
[00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.430] what's
[00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.570] the
[00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.790] world
[00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.050] made
[00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.210] of?
[00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.530] What
[00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.650] do
[00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.790] we
[00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.110] think,
[00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.350] as
[00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.710] modern
[00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.970] day
[00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.470] scientists,
[00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.170] are
[00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.410] the
[00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.150] basic
[00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.550] building
[00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.950] blocks
[00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.210] out
[00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.310] of
[00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.470] which
[00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.630] the
[00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.830] world
[00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.990] is
[00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.350] made?
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.560] If
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.640] we
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.720] were
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.820] to
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.180] conduct
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.340] a
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.340] survey
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.680] of
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.980] most
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.280] working
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.680] physicists
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.900] at
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.220] MIT,
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.520] or
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.700] really
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.160] anywhere
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.420] around
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.560] the
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.760] world
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.900] at
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.040] this
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.260] point,
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.060] we'd
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.160] get
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.300] an
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.620] answer
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.140] along
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.400] these
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.780] lines.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.000] We
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.180] would
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.460] hear
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.740] about
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.960] something
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.240] called
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.400] the
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.800] Standard
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.260] Model
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.580] of

[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.240] Physics,
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.460] which
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.880] is
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.520] amazing,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.720] and
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.860] we'll
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.060] actually
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.420] talk
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.660] a
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.780] bit
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.020] about
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.200] the
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.400] Standard
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.620] Model
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.940] later
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.260] in
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.420] this
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.800] semester.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.700] It
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.200] describes
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.360] the
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.580] world
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.740] as
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.900] made
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.020] up
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.200] of
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.600] a

[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.020] of

[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.420] like
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.600] the
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.000] quarks
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.220] and
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.800] electrons
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.060] and

[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.740] and
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.020] even
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.220] the
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.480] long

[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.200] Higgs
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.620] boson.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.120] There's
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.240] a
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.680] collection,
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.980] not
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.100] a

[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.280] of

[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.460] out
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.560] of
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.680] which
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.780] we
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.960] think
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.380] literally
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.700] everything
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.980] else
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.160] is
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.540] made.
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.440] We'd
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.600] hear
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.740] the
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.980] physicist
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.340] today
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.640] talk
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.820] about
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.060] the

[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.740] that
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.820] have
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.940] been
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.260] developed
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.460] to

[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.900] to

[00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.940] physicists
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.160] we
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.480] ask,
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.600] we
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.720] might

[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.340] more
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.440] than
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.520] we
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.940] invited,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.720] saying

[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.360] The
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.520] point
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.620] is,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.780] we're
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.800] going
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.840] to
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.940] get
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.060] an
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.340] answer
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.620] like
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.980] this
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.360] about
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.920] basically
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.860] particles

[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.480] Now,
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.600] if
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.680] we
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.760] were
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.880] to

[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.480] sincerely
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.760] hope
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.900] we
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.040] can
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.400] complete
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.700] soon,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.440] and
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.500] we
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.640] go
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.040] back
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.180] 100
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.460] or
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.660] let
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.760] alone
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.020] 200
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.640] years
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.200] to

[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:27.260] with
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.140] leading

[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.900] Britain,
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.640] and
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.740] we
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.180] told
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.360] them
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.540] this
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.980] answer,
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.240] that
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.580] physicists
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.920] today
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.080] said
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.200] the
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.380] world
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.500] is
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.620] made
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.760] of
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.120] particles
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.600] exchanging
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.060] particles
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.180] in
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.260] a
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.560] vacuum,
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.240] they
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.380] would
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.480] have
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.660] thought
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.860] we
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.120] were
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.920] really
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.280] not
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.620] with
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.900] it.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.640] I
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.860] like
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.980] to
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.100] think
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.200] they
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.300] would
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.380] have
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.600] shouted
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.120] bollocks,
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.260] or
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.360] at
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.400] least
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.620] something
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.840] maybe
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.060] more
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.380] colorful.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.100] Every
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.380] single
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.640] part
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.720] of
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.860] this
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.160] modern
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.520] answer
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.680] would
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.800] have
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.980] looked
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.840] extraordinarily
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.340] wrong
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.600]-headed
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.260] to
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.420] the
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.720] people
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.240] that
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.360] we're
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.460] going
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.540] to
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.760] spend
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.960] some
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.280] time
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.880] reading
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.140] about
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.280] and
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.520] talking
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.860] about
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.280] at
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.360] the
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.520] start
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.600] of
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.720] this
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.000] term.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.700] Why
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.960] is
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.140] that
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.580] important?
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.660] If
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.820] we
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.280] did
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.440] this
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.860] exercise
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.200] with
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.400] the
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.700] ancient
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.240] Mayans
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.440] or
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.700] the
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.120] medieval
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.640] Turks
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.480] or
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.840] the
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.600] Renaissance
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.060] French,
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.240] we'd
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.400] also
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.760] expect
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.020] some
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.380] disagreement.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.200] What
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.320] I
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.580] like
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.820] about
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.100] this
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.220] is
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.340] that
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.520] we're
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.880] turning
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.060] the

[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.600] back
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.960] not
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.440] so
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.000] far
[00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.910] compared
[00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.090] to
[00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.210] the
[00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.470] present
[00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.850] day,
[00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.770] and
[00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.970] yet
[00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:10.110] we
[00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.290] already
[00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.550] see
[00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.770] a
[00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.070] huge

[00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.830] in
[00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.990] the
[00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.390] answers.
[00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.070] As
[00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.230] we'll
[00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.450] see
[00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.730] throughout
[00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.050] today,
[00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.250] and
[00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.530] actually
[00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:14.950] for
[00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:15.410] several
[00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.970] class
[00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:16.310] sessions
[00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.490] for
[00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.610] the
[00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.950] term,
[00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.670] we
[00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.030] use
[00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.330] their
[00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.930] equations.
[00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:19.190] We
[00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.470] still
[00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.890] use
[00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.910] Maxwell's
[00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.330] equations,

[00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.990] example,
[00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.230] and
[00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.590] a
[00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:22.890] lot
[00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.990] of
[00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.110] the
[00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.450] ideas
[00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.070] that
[00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.310] Michael
[00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.750] Faraday
[00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.290] introduced,
[00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:25.930] and
[00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.090] yet
[00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.410] what
[00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:26.670] they
[00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:27.030] thought
[00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.310] those
[00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.810] equations
[00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.130] meant,
[00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:28.350] what
[00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.730] they
[00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:29.070] thought
[00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.230] they
[00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.330] were
[00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.770] describing
[00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.110] about
[00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.330] how
[00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:30.450] the
[00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.630] world
[00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:30.750] is
[00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:30.890] made
[00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:31.110] up,
[00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.610] are
[00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.990] almost
[00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.470] 180
[00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.850] degrees

[00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.990] how
[00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.130] we
[00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:35.390] start
[00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.590] our
[00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:35.930] investigations
[00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.510] today.
[00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.130] Even
[00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.410] though
[00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:37.830] some
[00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:38.290] parts
[00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.450] have
[00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.710] remained
[00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.910] the
[00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:39.210] same
[00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.450] going
[00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:39.630] over
[00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:39.950] these
[00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.770] 150
[00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:41.010] or
[00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.230] 200
[00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.610] years
[00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.730] to
[00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.870] the
[00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.250] past,
[00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:42.890] how
[00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:43.090] we
[00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.130] make
[00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.570] sense
[00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.810] of
[00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.150] those
[00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.650] ideas
[00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.890] or
[00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:46.090] those
[00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:46.510] techniques
[00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.070] have
[00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.310] gone
[00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:47.490] through
[00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:47.630] a
[00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.870] really
[00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.170] quite
[00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.530] amazing
[00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:48.990] change.
[00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.550] What
[00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.710] do
[00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.790] we
[00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.910] think
[00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.030] the
[00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:50.230] world
[00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.330] is
[00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.530] made
[00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:50.710] of?
[00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.010] That's
[00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.310] not
[00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:51.490] a
[00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.170] static
[00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:52.590] set
[00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.090] of
[00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.530] answers,
[00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.810] and
[00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:53.930] we
[00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.130] see
[00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:54.570] pretty
[00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.030] dramatic
[00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:55.490] change
[00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.750] even
[00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.050] over
[00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:56.630] a
[00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:56.950] relatively
[00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:57.270] short
[00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.670] span
[00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.170] of
[00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:58.490] history.
[00:07:59.370 --> 00:07:59.830] There's
[00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.210] another
[00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:00.730] shift
[00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:00.950] that
[00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:01.030] we
[00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.150] want
[00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:01.230] to
[00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.330] get
[00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:01.470] our
[00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:01.690] heads
[00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:01.910] into
[00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.170] and
[00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:02.770] attune
[00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.210] ourselves
[00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:03.470] to
[00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:03.630] as
[00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:03.950] well,
[00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.570] and
[00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.750] that
[00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.110] concerns
[00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.410] who
[00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.110] pursues
[00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.290] the

[00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.130] and

[00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.350] During

[00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.710] half
[00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.810] of

[00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:12.550] century,
[00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:12.750] we'll
[00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.070] start
[00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.290] this
[00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:13.730] class,
[00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:14.490] people
[00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:14.650] who
[00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:14.870] worked
[00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.990] on
[00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.130] what
[00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:15.390] we
[00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:15.550] would
[00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.850] call
[00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.370] physics,
[00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.910] electricity,

[00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.770] heat,
[00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.910] they
[00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:21.350] also
[00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.650] worked
[00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.790] on
[00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.990] things
[00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.090] that
[00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:22.170] we
[00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:22.310] would
[00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:22.630] call
[00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.070] not
[00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.510] physics,
[00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:23.930] like
[00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:24.370] chemistry

[00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:27.870] beyond
[00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.230] that.
[00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.950] For
[00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.230] them,
[00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:29.470] this
[00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:29.650] was
[00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:29.910] all

[00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:32.430] It
[00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:32.550] was
[00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.830] often
[00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.070] grouped
[00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.410] under

[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.220] actually
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.540] only
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.060] invented

[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:48.780] It's
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.320] remarkably
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.900] new
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.160] as
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.360] far
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.480] as

[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:54.220] actually
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.420] start
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:54.700] talking

[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.460] relatively
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:00.900] new,
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:01.440] and
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:01.700] what
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.020] these
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.600] particular

[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.300] scientists
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:03.480] that
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:03.620] we
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:03.780] would
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:03.920] now
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.180] call
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:04.620] physicists,
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:04.840] what
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.060] they
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.260] thought
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:05.460] they
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:05.640] should
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:05.900] do,
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.480] again,
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:06.760] some

[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.500] broad

[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:08.940] compared
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.160] to
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:09.280] what
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:09.420] we're
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:09.620] used
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:09.780] to

[00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.150] different
[00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.350] than
[00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.510] what
[00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:14.650] we
[00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:14.830] might
[00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:15.190] imagine

[00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.590] and

[00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.810] was
[00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:20.090] also
[00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.490] pretty
[00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:20.930] different

[00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.110] alone
[00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.390] much
[00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:23.650] further
[00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.010] back

[00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.390] stuff
[00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:26.530] we'll
[00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:26.730] start
[00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:26.910] by
[00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:27.170] talking
[00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.350] about
[00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.730] today
[00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.310] was

[00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.270] They
[00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:31.390] were

[00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:33.990] key
[00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.150] thing
[00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.290] is
[00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:34.430] these
[00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.570] were
[00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.030] not
[00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.570] places
[00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.170] where
[00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:36.650] students
[00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.010] took
[00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:37.490] classes

[00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:39.010] There
[00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:39.090] was

[00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:50.590] doing
[00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.010] what

[00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.230] would
[00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.430] call
[00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.810] scientific

[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:06.940] There's
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.080] a

[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:12.740] things
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:12.960] more
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.120] like
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.220] what
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:13.400] we'd
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:13.660] expect
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:13.880] to
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.020] see
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:14.540] ourselves.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:15.300] That
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:15.560] shift
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.040] begins
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.380] in
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.640] the
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:16.900] middle
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:17.160] of
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.280] the
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.060] 19th
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:18.060] century,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.260] so
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:18.380] more
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:18.580] like
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.160] 150
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.600] or
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.300] 107
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:20.600] years
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:20.980] ago,
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:21.680] rather
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:21.900] than
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.220] 200
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:22.520] years
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:22.720] ago
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:22.980] or
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.340] more.
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:24.400] There's
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:24.520] a
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:24.800] shift
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.120] to
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.440] where
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.520] research
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:26.920] in
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.360] fields
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:27.660] like
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.040] physics
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:28.580] gets
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:28.920] done
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.220] more
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.500] often
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:29.660] than
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:29.820] not
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:29.960] by
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.180] people
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:30.340] who
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:30.560] are
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.020] professors
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.460] in
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:31.900] universities
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.120] who
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.320] also
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:32.560] spend
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:32.700] some
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:32.780] of
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:32.840] the
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.040] time
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.340] teaching
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:33.900] students,
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:34.460] like
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:34.620] what
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:34.760] we
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.040] are
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.300] more
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:35.520] used
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:35.660] to
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:35.960] today.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.500] That
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.080] has
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.540] a
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:37.900] history.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.180] It's
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.420] actually
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:38.800] relatively
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.300] recent,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:39.900] and
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.000] it
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.980] emerges
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.380] really
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:41.680] in
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:41.860] the
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.040] middle
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.420] part
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:42.940] of
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.040] the
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.460] 19th
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:43.740] century.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:44.740] So
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:44.940] the
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.420] overall
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:45.740] theme
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:45.860] of
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:45.980] this
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.160] very
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:46.500] first
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:46.660] kind
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:46.760] of
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.040] warm
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.180]-up
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:47.340] for
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:47.460] the
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:47.920] class
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.840] is
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:48.940] to
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.140] kind
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:49.240] of
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:49.360] put
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:49.660] ourselves
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:49.880] on
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.300] guard.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.060] We
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.320] shouldn't
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:51.760] assume
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.060] that
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:52.260] our
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:52.740] current
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.080] sense
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.220] of
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.760] what's
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.320] expected
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.600] or
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:54.980] normal
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.240] or
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:55.700] familiar,
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:56.620] either
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:56.960] about
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.240] how
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.440] we
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:57.720] choose
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:57.900] to
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.220] study
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:58.400] the
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:58.680] natural
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.200] world,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:10:59.780] what
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.300] concepts
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:00.520] we
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:00.940] use,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:01.380] let
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:01.560] alone
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:01.900] how
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.180] we
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:02.660] think
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:02.980] we
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:03.440] should
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:03.600] be
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:03.840] pursuing
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.000] that,
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.080] or
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.220] what
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.500] kinds
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:04.700] of
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.340] institutions
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:05.600] or
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:05.860] job
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.200] descriptions.
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.020] We
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:07.180] shouldn't
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.440] expect
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:07.600] that
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.120] what's
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.380] familiar
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:08.620] to
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:08.760] us
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.140] today
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:09.680] is
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:09.880] just
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.040] how
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.220] people
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:10.420] did
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:10.800] things
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.000] in
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.120] the
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.560] past,
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.180] and
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:12.300] in
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:12.500] fact,
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:12.660] we'll
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:12.860] see
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.120] some
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.380] pretty
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:13.740] dramatic
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.200] changes
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:14.560] over
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:14.900] a
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.180] relatively
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:15.600] short
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:15.940] span
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.100] of
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:16.360] time.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:17.240] So
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:17.320] let
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:17.360] me
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:17.660] pause
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:17.780] there
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:17.880] and
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.140] ask
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:18.220] if
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:18.280] there
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:18.280] are
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:18.400] any
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:18.680] questions
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:18.880] just
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:18.980] on
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:19.100] that
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:19.380] early
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:19.600] kind
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:19.720] of
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:19.980] warm
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.220]-up.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:21.800] Anyone
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.000] have
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.160] any
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.460] thoughts
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:22.680] or
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.100] questions
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.300] about
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:23.520] that?
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.220] If
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:34.440] not,
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:34.560] then
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:34.680] I'm
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:34.700] going
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:34.780] to
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.100] press
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.420] on.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.320] Again,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.480] feel
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:36.680] free
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:36.940] to
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.300] jump
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:37.440] in
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:37.540] on
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:37.640] the
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:37.920] chat
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.120] if
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.320] things
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:39.520] come
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:39.740] up.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:40.760] Let's
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:40.900] talk
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.020] about
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:41.180] this
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:41.660] first
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:41.900] figure
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.020] I
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.180] already
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:42.700] mentioned,
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:43.560] Michael
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.020] Faraday.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:44.200] We're
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.220] going
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:44.240] to
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:44.380] spend
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:44.500] a
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:44.580] little
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:44.820] time
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.040] talking
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:45.220] about
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:45.580] Faraday.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:45.920] I
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.160] think
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.300] he's
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:46.560] fascinating.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.660] So
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:47.780] he
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.040] became
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.200] one
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.280] of
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:48.360] the
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:48.560] most
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.000] successful,
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:49.320] actually
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.500] one
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:49.560] of
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:49.620] the
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:49.760] most
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.220] famous
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:50.640] natural
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.120] philosophers
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.520] in
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:51.680] his
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.060] lifetime,
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.260] in
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:52.420] fact,
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:52.640] really
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:52.980] of
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.100] the
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.400] entire
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:53.920] 19th
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.260] century.
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.080] He
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.200] had
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:55.360] a
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:55.540] pretty
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.020] remarkable
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.600] personal
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.180] story,
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:57.860] and
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.020] I
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.180] think
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:58.340] we'll
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:58.560] also
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:58.820] see
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.020] he
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.300] helps
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:11:59.600] sort
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:11:59.720] of
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:11:59.920] make
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.300] clear
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:00.480] some
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:00.580] of
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:00.660] the
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.000] larger
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.200] social
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.400] and
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:02.800] institutional
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.220] changes
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:03.440] going
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:03.780] on
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.080] as
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.260] well.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:04.600] He
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:04.840] helps
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:04.980] us
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:05.340] understand
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:05.520] his
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.020] own
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.700] larger
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.080] time
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.360] period.
[00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:08.870] Personally,
[00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:09.030] he
[00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.170] had
[00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.330] this
[00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:09.650] really
[00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:10.570] kind
[00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:10.650] of
[00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:11.270] inspiring
[00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:11.730] rags
[00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:11.890]-to
[00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.170]-riches
[00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:12.590] story.
[00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.050] He
[00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:13.170] was
[00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:13.330] born
[00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:13.470] into
[00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.790] a
[00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.110] rather
[00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.410] poor
[00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:14.850] family.
[00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.010] He
[00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:15.330] never
[00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:15.610] attended
[00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:15.990] high
[00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.250] school,
[00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:16.490] let
[00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.650] alone
[00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.030] college
[00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.130] or
[00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:17.590] university.
[00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.970] He
[00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:21.110] was
[00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.630] apprenticed
[00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:21.890] to
[00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:22.110] a
[00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.710] bookbinder
[00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.970] at
[00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.170] age
[00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:23.550] 13.
[00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:23.710] That
[00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.810] means
[00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:23.910] he
[00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:24.150] literally
[00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.510] left
[00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:24.730] his
[00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.170] family,
[00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:25.930] moved
[00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:26.210] in
[00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.550] with
[00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.230] his
[00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.210] main
[00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:28.770] tutor,
[00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.130] and
[00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:30.310] was
[00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.830] apprenticed
[00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:31.050] in
[00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:31.150] a
[00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.350] kind
[00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.570] of
[00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.690] trade.
[00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:33.630] So
[00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:33.750] in
[00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.910] that
[00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.110] sense,
[00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:34.450] his
[00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:35.590] career
[00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:36.150] path
[00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.550] started
[00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.750] out
[00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.210] closer
[00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:37.450] to
[00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:37.610] what
[00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.710] we
[00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.870] might
[00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.230] expect
[00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.430] of
[00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.590] the
[00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.910] Renaissance
[00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.170] or
[00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.330] even
[00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:39.510] the
[00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:39.690] Middle
[00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:40.170] Ages
[00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:40.810] than
[00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:40.910] to
[00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.030] the
[00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.310] modern
[00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.690] period.
[00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:42.410] It
[00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:42.550] was
[00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.690] a
[00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:42.870] kind
[00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.990] of
[00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.290] time
[00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:43.510] still

[00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:46.050] and
[00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:46.290] his
[00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:46.790] role,
[00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:47.010] his

[00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.330] to

[00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:48.530] was
[00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.710] to
[00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.990] learn
[00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.170] the

[00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:51.230] skills
[00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.530] of
[00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.690] being
[00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:51.850] a
[00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:52.410] bookbinder,
[00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.130] starting
[00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:53.750] early
[00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.990] on.
[00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:55.290] He
[00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:55.530] met
[00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:55.670] the
[00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.930] very
[00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:56.350] famous

[00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:58.510] Davy,
[00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:59.130] when
[00:12:59.130 --> 00:12:59.370] Davy
[00:12:59.370 --> 00:12:59.590] gave
[00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.730] a
[00:12:59.730 --> 00:12:59.950] series
[00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:00.150] of
[00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.490] public
[00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:00.850] lectures

[00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.030] at
[00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.190] the
[00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:02.430] Royal

[00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.490] in
[00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:03.770] London,
[00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:03.930] and
[00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:04.030] we'll
[00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.250] talk
[00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.390] a
[00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:04.610] bit
[00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.830] about
[00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:04.990] the
[00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.130] Royal
[00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:05.610] Institution.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.160] It
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:07.340] was
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:07.600] not
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:07.740] a
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.140] university.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:08.400] It
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:08.500] was
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:08.620] a
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:08.880] place
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.020] where
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:09.440] research
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:09.660] was
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:09.920] done
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.260] and
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:10.560] public
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:10.880] lectures
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.040] were
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.220] given.
[00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.190] So
[00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:12.550] Faraday
[00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.810] was
[00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.050] just
[00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:13.810] mesmerized
[00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.010] by
[00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.330] Davy's
[00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:14.550] lectures.
[00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:14.710] He
[00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.870] actually
[00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.130] took
[00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:15.430] very
[00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.810] careful
[00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:16.270] notes
[00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:16.570] on
[00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:16.710] these
[00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.050] public
[00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:17.490] lectures.
[00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:18.570] Faraday
[00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:18.730] then
[00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.130] bound
[00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:19.310] them
[00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.610] into
[00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.770] a
[00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:20.090] beautiful,
[00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.390] very
[00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:20.750] fancy
[00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.110] book,
[00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:21.650] and
[00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.890] here's
[00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:22.010] how
[00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:22.110] we
[00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.230] know
[00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.330] he
[00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:22.450] was
[00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:22.610] so
[00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.870] smart.
[00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.310] He
[00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.470] then
[00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.810] gave
[00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:24.050] that
[00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.490] fancy
[00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:24.790] book
[00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.070] to
[00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:25.530] Davy
[00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:25.750] as
[00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.910] a
[00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:26.130] gift,
[00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:26.270] and
[00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:26.330] I
[00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:26.450] have
[00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:26.550] a
[00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.710] hint
[00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.890] here
[00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:26.990] of
[00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.090] what
[00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:27.210] you
[00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:27.310] can
[00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:27.410] do
[00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.490] with
[00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:27.610] that
[00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.010] information.
[00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:29.130] He
[00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.370] basically
[00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:29.750] bribed
[00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.870] his
[00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:30.010] way
[00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:30.210] into
[00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:30.350] a
[00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.490] new
[00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:30.710] kind
[00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.790] of
[00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.190] apprenticeship.
[00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:32.490] Davy
[00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:32.630] was
[00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:32.790] very
[00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.230] flattered
[00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.490] and
[00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:33.890] impressed
[00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:34.130] by
[00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:34.310] the
[00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.470] kind
[00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.570] of
[00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:35.050] manual
[00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:35.490] skills,
[00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.690] by
[00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:35.810] the
[00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:36.550] dexterity
[00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.110] that
[00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.410] Faraday
[00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:37.590] had
[00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:38.010] shown,
[00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:38.630] so
[00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:38.950] Davy
[00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:39.370] hired
[00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:39.870] Faraday
[00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:40.310] for
[00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.650] basically
[00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:40.830] a
[00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.010] new
[00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:41.230] kind
[00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.330] of
[00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:41.790] apprenticeship.
[00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.010] Faraday
[00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:43.270] had
[00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:43.750] never
[00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.050] attended
[00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.270] high
[00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:44.450] school
[00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:44.630] or
[00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:44.910] college.
[00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.030] It
[00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.230] wasn't
[00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.370] that
[00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:45.450] he
[00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:45.610] was
[00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.030] trained
[00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.430] in
[00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.870] mathematical
[00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.310] physics,
[00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:47.630] quite
[00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:47.810] the
[00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:48.150] contrary,
[00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:48.850] but
[00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.110] Davy
[00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.470] figured
[00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.030] Faraday
[00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.190] could
[00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:50.370] do
[00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:50.570] some
[00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:50.770] new
[00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.010] kinds
[00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:51.210] of
[00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:51.630] manual
[00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.390] dexterity
[00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:52.830] skills
[00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:53.630] in
[00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:53.770] the
[00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:54.130] laboratory
[00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:54.590] as
[00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.770] a
[00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:55.070] laboratory
[00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:55.550] assistant,
[00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.170] a
[00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.330] kind
[00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:56.470] of
[00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:57.410] continuation
[00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:58.090] of
[00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:58.230] his
[00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.730] bookbinder
[00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.310] apprenticeship.
[00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:00.210] So
[00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:00.470] that's
[00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.590] how
[00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.590] Faraday
[00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.910] enters
[00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:02.070] what
[00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:02.170] we
[00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:02.370] now
[00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:02.650] call
[00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:02.830] the
[00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.190] world
[00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:03.310] of
[00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.610] natural
[00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.170] philosophy.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.020] So
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:05.360] years
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:05.460] and
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:05.600] years
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:05.760] go
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:05.860] by.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:05.980] They
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.120] work
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.320] very
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:06.620] closely
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:06.800] for
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:06.900] a
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.040] long
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.380] time.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.240] Davy
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:08.600] eventually
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:08.980] steps
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.320] down,
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:09.500] he
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.040] retires,
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:10.620] and
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.000] Faraday
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.140] in
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.280] fact
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:11.560] became
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:11.780] his
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.240] successor,
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:12.880] now
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.060] the
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.420] director
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:13.700] of
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:13.880] this
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.160] royal
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.700] institution
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.120] in
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.360] London.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.140] So
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:16.400] much
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:16.600] like
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:16.740] I
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.020] mentioned
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.340] a
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:17.480] few
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:17.760] moments
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:17.980] ago,
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:18.440] Faraday
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:18.780] worked
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.020] on
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.640] really
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:19.900] a
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.080] kind
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.200] of
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:20.660] mind
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.080]-boggling
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.520] array
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:21.760] of
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.200] topics,
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:22.460] mind
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:22.720]-boggling
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:22.880] from
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.120] our
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.540] modern
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:23.820] point
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:23.960] of
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.120] view,
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.040] quite
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.120] kind
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.260] of
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:26.680] familiar
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:26.980] to
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.220] his
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:27.440] own
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.140] contemporaries.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:28.720] So
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:28.840] he
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.080] worked
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:29.320] on
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:29.500] what
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:29.740] we
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:29.940] would
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.340] separately
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:30.760] classify
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:30.940] as
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.360] chemistry,
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:31.920] optics,
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.660] electromagnetism,
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.300] electrolysis,
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:33.480] and
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:33.940] more.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:35.380] To
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:35.760] Faraday,
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:35.900] these
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.020] were
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:36.260] all

[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:39.300] he
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:39.420] was
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:39.920] particularly
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.340] fascinated,

[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.280] more
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:42.400] than

[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:45.940] of

[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.000] How
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.280] could
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:47.880] electrical
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.420] effects
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.060] make,
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.240] you

[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.720] effects
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.060] happen,
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:51.380] like
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.200] using
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:52.560] electric
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:52.960] shocks
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.160] to

[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:54.960] How

[00:14:59.640 --> 00:14:59.680] So
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:14:59.940] the
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.300] way
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:00.440] that

[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.280] force
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:02.780] could
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:02.960] have
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.320] effects

[00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:05.450] Now
[00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:05.870] Faraday
[00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.130] was
[00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:06.690] partly
[00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.210] inspired
[00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:07.450] in
[00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:07.630] this
[00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:07.810] kind

[00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.490] Some
[00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:11.670] really
[00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.870] very
[00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.070] interesting
[00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:12.330] work
[00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:12.510] by
[00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:12.650] a

[00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:14.910] Faraday,
[00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:15.550] who
[00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.790] tried
[00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.950] to
[00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:16.230] understand
[00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.450] why
[00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:16.770] Faraday
[00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:17.090] took
[00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.410] this

[00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:17.770] of

[00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.150] even
[00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.410] more
[00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:19.910] fervently,
[00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:20.490] than

[00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:22.470] And

[00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.050] compelling

[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:25.940] Faraday
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.580] belonged
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:26.780] to

[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:29.880] He

[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.240] emphasized

[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.080] as
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.240] well.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:05.880] He
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.180] became
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:06.360] a
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:06.760] beloved,
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.160] very
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.560] successful
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.080] public
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:08.540] lecturer.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:08.820] He
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.560] continued
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:09.820] the
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.160] tradition
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:10.320] that
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:10.560] Humphrey
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:10.900] Davy
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.260] had
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:11.580] done
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.400] at
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:12.520] the
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:12.580] Royal
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:12.880] Institution,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:13.140] giving
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:13.360] these
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.200] very,
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:14.400] very
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:14.760] well
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.180]-attended

[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:15.560]-called
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.000] Christmas
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.520] lectures.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.140] These
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.540] still
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:17.940] continue
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.120] from
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.320] Royal

[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:18.980] to
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.160] this
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:19.500] day.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.240] Faraday
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:20.420] would
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:20.660] really
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.000] fill
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.180] the
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:21.420] lecture
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:21.660] hall
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:21.800] and
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:21.920] give
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.100] these
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:22.720] dazzling,
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.580] spectacular
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.320] demonstrations
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:24.980] of
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.360] electrical
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:25.780] effects
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:25.960] and
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:26.280] chemical

[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:26.820] and
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:26.980] all
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:27.060] the
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.280] rest.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.080] That's
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.260] partly
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:28.680] why
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:28.800] he
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.040] became
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.360] so
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:29.720] beloved
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:29.860] and
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.000] well
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.220]-known
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:30.900] in
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.020] his
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.360] lifetime.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.040] You
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.340] can't
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:32.500] quite
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:32.680] see
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:32.760] it
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:32.820] in
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:32.940] this
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.500] engraving.
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:34.140] It's
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:34.260] hard
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:34.400] to
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:34.560] tell,
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:34.700] but
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:34.900] these
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.180] were,
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.320] this
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:36.580] really
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:36.740] was
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:36.900] the
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:37.340] definition
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:37.600] of
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:37.960] popular.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:38.200] The
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:38.440] tickets
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:38.660] were
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:38.960] not
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.200] too
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:39.720] expensive.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:40.380] That's
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:40.540] partly
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:40.880] how
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.380] very
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:41.680] young
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:41.880] and
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.080] poor
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.500] Faraday
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:42.880] himself
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.160] was
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:43.320] able
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:43.380] to
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:43.700] attend
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:43.980] as
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.120] a
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:44.460] child.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:44.980] It
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.300] wasn't
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:45.580] like
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.080] attending,
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:46.400] you
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:46.600] know,
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.120] the
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.600] fanciest
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:47.920] opera
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.440] performance
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:48.960] in
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.440] high
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:49.700]-elite
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.040] London.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:50.820] There
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.060] was
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:51.220] a
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:51.520] kind
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:51.660] of,
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.020] you
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.600] know,
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:52.840] there'd
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:52.940] be
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.180] cheap
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:53.360] seats.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:53.500] You
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:53.620] can
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:53.760] see
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:53.900] how
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.140] large
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:54.300] the
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:54.500] hall
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:54.720] was.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:54.860] So
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.140] they're
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:55.600] very
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:55.980] nice,
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:56.140] you
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:56.300] know,
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:56.760] fancy
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.100] seats
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.440] then
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:57.600] as
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:57.840] now
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.060] were
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.460] expensive,
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:58.960] and
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.840] tickets
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.120] would
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:00.280] go
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:00.440] to
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.360] the
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.240] affluent
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:02.820] and
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.000] well
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.120]-to
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:03.260]-do.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:03.940] But
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.080] there
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.360] really
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:04.620] was
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:04.740] a,
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:05.000] what
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.140] we
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:05.340] today
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:05.480] would
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:05.660] call
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:05.760] a
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:05.920] kind
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.020] of
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:06.540] outreach.
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:06.700] It
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:06.780] was
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:06.900] a
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.100] real
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:07.480] effort
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:07.940] to
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.160] reach
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:08.960] across
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.620] several
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:09.920] kind
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.100] of
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:10.680] social
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:10.860] and
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.160] economic
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:11.640] classes,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:11.940] not
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.240] all
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:12.380] the
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:12.680] way,
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.100] but
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:13.440] broader
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:13.640] than
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:13.920] only
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.200] the
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:14.460] very
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:14.800] elite.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:15.440] And
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:15.600] they
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.100] became
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:16.400] a
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:16.540] really
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.080] beloved
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:17.720] kind
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:17.840] of
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.180] city
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.740] institution
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.060] within
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:19.340] London.
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:19.640] People
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:19.800] would
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.060] come
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.320] in
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:20.500] from
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:20.660] out
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:20.820] of
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:21.180] town
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.040] to
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:22.380] attend
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:22.540] them.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:22.640] It
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:22.920] became
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.080] an
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:23.340] annual
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:23.820] tradition,
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.000] and
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.320] Faraday
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:25.680] became
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.200] especially
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:26.580] beloved
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:26.800] as
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:26.920] a
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.220] presenter
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:27.580] in
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:27.780] that
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.140] tradition.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:28.700] So
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:28.820] they
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.020] really
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.200] were
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:29.480] reaching
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:29.820] not
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.060] only
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.360] people
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:30.520] who
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:30.680] had
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:30.960] any
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.400] interest
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.180] in
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.060] natural
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.500] philosophy.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:33.620] It
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:33.700] was
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:33.980] really
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.200] the
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.420] kind
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:34.600] of
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.200] a
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.400] way
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:35.560] of
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:35.800] showing
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:35.960] a
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.280] kind
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:36.420] of
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.420] sophistication
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.600] and
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.300] a
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:39.460] way
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:39.700] for
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.180] members
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:40.460] of
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:40.900] the
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.040] so
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:41.220]-called
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:41.880] aspiring
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.500] classes,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:42.840] meaning
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.060] those
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:43.180] who
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.400] weren't
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:43.560] so
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:43.700] well
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:43.820]-to
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:43.980]-do,
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:44.600] to
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:44.720] be
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:44.800] able
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:44.900] to
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:45.240] participate
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:45.440] in
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:45.620] things
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:45.720] that
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:45.840] they
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.120] saw
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:46.300] the
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:46.440] real
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:46.740] elites
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.040] doing.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:47.240] So
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:47.340] it
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:47.520] really
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:47.840] had
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.180] an
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:48.620] interesting
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.200] kind
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.300] of
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:49.740] social
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.140] cross
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:50.380]-section
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:50.580] to
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:50.720] them.
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.280] Historians
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:51.360] have
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:51.460] written
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:51.620] a
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:51.800] lot
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:51.880] of
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.020] issues
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.320] about
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.860] these
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.080] public
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.280] lectures.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:53.460] They
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:53.640] really
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:53.960] were
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.560] talked
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:54.800] about
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.120] broadly,
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:55.600] covered
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:55.800] in
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.180] the
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:56.720] broadsheet
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.180] newspapers
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:57.360] and
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:57.460] all
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:57.560] that.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.240] In
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:58.440] this
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:58.720] time
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.080] period,
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:17:59.640] the
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.120] main
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.160] mechanisms
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.400] were
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:01.720] largely
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.340] books.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.120] So
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.500] even
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.560] scientists,
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.060] like
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.540] whom
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:05.640] we
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:05.760] would
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:05.900] call
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.240] physicists,
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:07.040] were
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:07.460] mostly
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:07.860] writing
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.800] monographs
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.280] and
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:09.660] sometimes
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.040] writing
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.360] short
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:10.700] articles
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:10.900] for
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.180] fellow
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:11.720] specialists.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:11.920] There
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.180] were
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:12.560] scientific
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.080] journals,
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.060] some
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.180] of
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:14.260] the
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:14.620] earliest
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:14.760] had
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:14.860] been
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.160] founded
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:15.400] in
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:15.660] England,
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:15.940] going
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.180] back
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:16.320] to
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:16.460] the
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.400] 1660s,
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.000] similar
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.260] ones
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:18.420] in
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:18.980] other
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.280] parts
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:19.420] of
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:19.640] Europe.
[00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:20.590] But
[00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.190] the
[00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.490] real
[00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:21.870] kind
[00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.990] of
[00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.450] transfer
[00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.170] mechanisms
[00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.070] were
[00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.390] often
[00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.650] through
[00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:25.330] monographs.
[00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.450] That's
[00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:25.710] partly
[00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.970] why
[00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:26.610] Maxwell's
[00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:26.930] treatise
[00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:27.050] that
[00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:27.170] we'll
[00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:27.370] talk
[00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:27.510] about
[00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.670] later
[00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:28.030] today
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.180] became
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:29.580] so
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.520] widely
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:30.880] known
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.000] and
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.120] so
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.600] influential.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:32.380] There
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:32.560] were
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:32.740] then
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:32.960] these
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.900] lectures.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.060] They
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.160] were
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:34.420] also
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:34.640] so
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:34.840]-called
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.660] itinerant
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.080] lectures,
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:36.920] people
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.060] who
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:37.260] made
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:37.400] their
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:37.680] whole
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.020] living
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:38.580] just
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:38.900] giving
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.600] popular
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:39.960] lectures
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.200] on
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:40.600] topics
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:40.980] like
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.480] electricity,
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.380] town
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:42.560] to
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:42.900] town.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.160] So
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:43.400] not
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:43.560] just
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:43.740] in
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:43.940] London,
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.140] but
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.280] to
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:44.480] the
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.600] outskirts
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:45.740] and
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.020] likewise
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:46.520] throughout
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.500] provincial
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:47.900] France
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.000] and
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.140] other
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:48.440] places.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.060] So
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:49.240] there
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.500] were
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:49.700] kind
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:49.800] of
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.280] popular
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:50.620] lectures.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:50.740] In
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:50.880] that
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.040] sense,
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:51.140] you
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:51.260] can
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:51.400] think
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:51.480] of
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:51.540] it
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:51.680] almost
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.140] like
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.920] PBS
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.480] television
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:53.920] today,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:54.160] like
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.500] NOVA
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.120] specials.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:55.920] But
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.120] for
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:56.540] fellow
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.220] specialists,
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:57.860] there
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.000] were
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.400] just
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:58.620] the
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.040] start
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:18:59.580] of
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:00.820] professional
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.300] meetings,
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:01.500] the
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:01.720] British
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.320] Association
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:02.500] for
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:02.560] the
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:02.820] Advancement
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:02.940] of
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.220] Science,
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:03.520] having
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.060] annual
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.460] meetings
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:04.780] of
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:04.900] the
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.060] sort
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:05.180] that
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:05.260] would
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:05.480] become
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:05.700] so
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.040] familiar
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.620] for
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:06.920] fellow
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.500] specialists.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.340] Sometimes
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:08.760] those
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:08.840] would
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:08.960] be
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.240] covered
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:09.460] in
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:09.640] the
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.060] national
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.620] newspapers.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.200] It
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:11.260] was
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:11.380] a
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:11.740] hodgepodge.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.020] Some
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:12.200] things
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:12.460] would
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:12.920] look
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.180] familiar
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:13.360] to
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:13.640] us.
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.140] Some
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:14.260] things
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:14.400] might
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:14.600] seem
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:14.720] a
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:14.860] little
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.520] more
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.000] unusual.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:17.180] But
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:17.640] Faraday
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:17.900] wrote
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.260] books
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:18.400] and
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.640] books
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:18.800] and
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.000] some
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.380] articles,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:19.580] for
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.260] example.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:21.600] And
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.100] certainly
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:22.400] some
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:22.480] of
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:22.560] this
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:22.680] would
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:22.820] get
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.220] into
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:23.460] the
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:23.800] curriculum
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.120] for
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.620] universities,
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:24.760] and
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:24.820] we'll
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.040] talk
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:25.240] more
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:25.560] about
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:25.780] that
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.040] actually,
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:26.400] especially
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:26.960] later
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.240] today
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:27.340] and
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:27.420] in
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:27.520] the
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:27.700] next
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:27.980] class
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.260] session.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.060] But
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:29.180] the
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:29.380] way
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:29.560] that
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:29.720] kind
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:29.920] of
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.340] fellow
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:30.900] researchers
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.480] interacted
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:31.660] with
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:31.820] fellow
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.260] researchers,
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:32.440] it
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:32.660] was
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.080] largely
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.420] through
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:33.920] books,
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:34.720] sometimes
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:34.920] through
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.240] journals,
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:35.500] and
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:35.660] through
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:35.860] these
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:36.160] different
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.460] kinds
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:36.580] of
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:36.900] lectures.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:37.240] Great,
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:37.420] great
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:37.700] questions.
[00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:39.850] I'm
[00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:39.890] going
[00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.950] to
[00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:40.070] move
[00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.430] on.
[00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.410] These
[00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:41.530] are
[00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:41.730] great
[00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.110] questions.
[00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:42.750] I'll
[00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.930] try
[00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:43.070] to
[00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.250] answer
[00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.510] more
[00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.630] that
[00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.690] I
[00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:43.810] don't
[00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:43.970] get
[00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:44.210] to
[00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.030] as
[00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:45.130] we
[00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:45.270] go
[00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.610] further.
[00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.430] But
[00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.510] I
[00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.610] want
[00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.690] to
[00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:46.810] get
[00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:47.010] to
[00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:47.230] one
[00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:47.290] of
[00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:47.370] the
[00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:47.650] topics
[00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:47.910] that
[00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.110] was
[00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.590] really,
[00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:48.810] really
[00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:49.190] high
[00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.470] on
[00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:50.070] Faraday's
[00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.550] list
[00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.050] of
[00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:51.270] most
[00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.690] important.
[00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.870] This
[00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.970] is
[00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:52.110] really
[00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.230] going
[00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.350] to
[00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.590] set
[00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.930] our
[00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:53.430] kind
[00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.610] of
[00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.030] agenda
[00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:54.470] for
[00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.810] several
[00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.210] classes
[00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:55.410] to
[00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:55.550] come.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:56.360] And
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:56.580] that's
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:56.680] what
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:56.860] was
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.300] called
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:57.760] the
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.140] ether,
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.360] a
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.360] presumptive,
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:00.840] hypothetical
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.800] medium
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.520] that
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:02.700] pretty
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:02.940] much
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.600] everyone
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:03.920] that
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.020] we're
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.120] going
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:04.160] to
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:04.380] talk
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:04.640] about,
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.120] Faraday
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:05.520] included,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:06.240] just
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:06.760] assumed,
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:06.940] they
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.180] kind
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:07.320] of
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:07.720] knew,
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:07.940] they
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.080] had
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.240] an
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.920] extremely
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.320] strong
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:09.920] confidence
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.660] that
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:10.940] this
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.420] medium
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:11.640] was
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:11.940] filling
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.340] all
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:12.480] of
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:12.860] space,
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.100] filled
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:13.420] every
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:13.640] nook
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:13.780] and
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.060] cranny
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.400] of
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:14.540] the
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:14.920] universe.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:15.980] And
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:16.180] it
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:16.580] was
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:16.760] this
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.300] medium
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:17.580] that
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:17.960] filled
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.680] everything
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.560] that
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.200] enabled
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:20.720] various
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.140] processes
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:21.340] to
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:21.620] affect
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:21.760] one
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:21.900] another.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.060] That
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:22.180] was
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:22.320] the
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:22.460] kind
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:22.580] of

[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:23.820] of
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.160] forces.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:24.900] Why
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.200] did
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.680] electrical
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.040] effects
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:26.240] lead
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:26.360] to
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:26.660] magnetic
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.040] effects?
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:27.220] Because
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:27.380] they're
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:27.680] both
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.780] ultimately
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.260] effects
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:29.560] of
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:29.760] this
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.160] ether
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:30.520] that
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:30.800] connects
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.340] everything.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:31.940] So
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.280] what's
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:32.440] the
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:32.720] ether?
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.520] Just
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:34.820] during
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.320] Faraday's
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:35.700] own
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.580] childhood,
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.480] another
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:37.760] kind
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:37.880] of
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.280] amateur
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:38.740] British
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.420] naturalist
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:39.640] named
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:39.980] Thomas
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:40.320] Young,
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.300] building
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:41.480] on
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:41.620] some
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:41.820] work
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.000] by
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.380] French
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:42.840] scholars
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.160] from
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:43.580] around
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:43.720] the
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:43.880] same
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.220] time,
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:44.400] right
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.540] around
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:44.640] the
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:44.760] year
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.240] 1800,
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.100] had
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:46.460] advanced
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:46.740] a
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.060] wave
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.420] theory
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:47.620] of
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:47.900] light.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.080] This
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.180] is
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.480] opposite
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:48.780] actually
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.140] to
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.480] Isaac
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:49.840] Newton's
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:49.980] theory
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.120] of
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.280] light,
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:50.400] who
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:50.500] had
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:50.820] a
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.380] particle
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:51.520] and
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:51.620] a
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.180] corpuscular
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:52.460] theory.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.300] So
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:53.620] Thomas
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:53.860] Young,
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:54.100] like
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.220] some
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:54.300] of
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:54.400] the
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:54.660] French
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.240] scholars
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:55.420] as
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:55.600] well,
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:56.460] suggested
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:56.700] a
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:56.960] whole
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.200] bunch
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:57.340] of
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:57.740] optical
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.220] phenomena
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:58.560] like
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.600] interference,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.060] like
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:00.580] reflection
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:00.800] and
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.320] refraction,
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.120] could
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:02.460] really
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.040] only
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.240] be
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:03.480] made
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:03.780] sense
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.000] of
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.220] if
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:04.500] light
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:04.700] was
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:04.860] a
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.120] series
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.440] of
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:05.820] waves.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.020] And
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:06.440] I'm
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:06.580] sure
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:06.760] you've
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.000] seen
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.200] this.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:07.340] It's
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:07.540] a
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:07.660] very
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.000] simple
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.520] illustration.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.460] If
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:09.720] two
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.080] waves
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:10.460] are
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:10.920] perfectly
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.200] in
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:11.440] sync
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:11.620] with
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:11.760] each
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:11.900] other,
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.080] we'd
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:12.220] say
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.400] in
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:12.900] phase,
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:13.380] you
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:13.500] can
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:13.660] get
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.280] constructive
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:14.840] interference.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:15.120] The
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:15.360] peaks
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.480] will
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:15.700] become
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.080] larger
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:16.240] than
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:16.480] either
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:16.740] wave
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.020] alone.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.240] The
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:17.520] troughs
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:17.780] become
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.100] deeper.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.060] Of
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.220] course,
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:19.360] if
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:19.520] those
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:19.760] two
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.020] waves
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.220] are
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:20.700] exactly
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.120] out
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.280] of
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:21.480] sync
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:21.620] with
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:21.740] each
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:21.900] other,
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.020] if
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:22.100] they're
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:22.320] perfectly
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:22.760] out
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:22.920] of
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.220] phase,
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:23.640] you
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:23.740] can
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:23.920] get
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.400] destructive
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:24.920] interference
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.080] and
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.160] the
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.520] resultant
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:25.780] wave
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:25.900] will
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.200] vanish
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.640] altogether
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:26.880] and
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.020] sort
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:27.080] of
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.300] anything
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:27.500] in
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:27.740] between.
[00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:29.110] So
[00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.370] Young
[00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:29.490] and
[00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:29.730] others
[00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:29.950] were
[00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:30.230] convinced
[00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.470] that
[00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.970] these
[00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:31.430] interference
[00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.990] phenomena
[00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.550] kind
[00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:32.670] of
[00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:32.810] were
[00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:33.830] natural
[00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:34.510] indications
[00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.790] that
[00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.030] light
[00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:35.210] is
[00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.370] a
[00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:35.650] wave
[00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.030] phenomena.
[00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:36.190] But
[00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.310] then
[00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.450] the
[00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:36.630] next
[00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.930] question
[00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:37.170] is,
[00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.590] well,
[00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:38.070] waves
[00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.250] of
[00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:38.670] what?
[00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:39.150] Waves
[00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:39.550] in
[00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:39.890] what?
[00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.670] Ocean
[00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:41.010] waves
[00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:41.110] are
[00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.330] clearly
[00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:41.750] waves
[00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.050] of
[00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:42.490] water.
[00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:43.270] Sound
[00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.590] waves
[00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.770] or
[00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:44.510] compressions
[00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.650] are
[00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:44.970] waves
[00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:45.230] in
[00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.390] the
[00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.830] atmosphere,
[00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:46.030] in
[00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:46.130] the
[00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:46.450] air.
[00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.090] What
[00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.230] are
[00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.650] waves
[00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:48.470] of?
[00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:49.070] So
[00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.170] they
[00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:49.310] said,
[00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.430] well,
[00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.790] any
[00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.090] wave
[00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.190] we
[00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.330] know
[00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.550] about
[00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:50.790] is
[00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:50.930] a
[00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:51.150] wave
[00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:51.510] in
[00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.850] some
[00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.270] medium.
[00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:52.510] There
[00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.790] must
[00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:52.990] be
[00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.130] a
[00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:53.430] medium
[00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:54.070] that
[00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.490] carries
[00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:54.690] these
[00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:54.970] light
[00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:55.230] waves.
[00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.330] It
[00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:55.410] was
[00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:55.650] called
[00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:55.870] the
[00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:56.770] luminiferous
[00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.030] ether,
[00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:57.230] which
[00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.330] is
[00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:57.470] a
[00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.710] very
[00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:58.070] fancy
[00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.410] word.
[00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:59.030] You
[00:21:59.030 --> 00:21:59.150] can
[00:21:59.150 --> 00:21:59.270] see
[00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.370] how
[00:21:59.370 --> 00:21:59.510] to
[00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.750] parse
[00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.870] it
[00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:00.170] here.
[00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.770] If
[00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.850] you
[00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.190] remember
[00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.890] either
[00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:02.290] Latin
[00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:02.590] or
[00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.870] Harry
[00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:03.130] Potter,
[00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:03.270] I
[00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.450] find
[00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:03.550] them
[00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:03.870] equally
[00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:04.250] helpful.
[00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.730] Think
[00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.970] about
[00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:05.810] the
[00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:06.550] lumos
[00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.370] spell
[00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.630] in
[00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.810] Harry
[00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:08.010] Potter.
[00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.750] The
[00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.290] lumine
[00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:09.750] part
[00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.110] just
[00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.350] means
[00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.790] light,
[00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:11.410] referring
[00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:11.670] to
[00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:12.010] light.
[00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:12.930] Ferris
[00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.210] means
[00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:13.770] carrying.
[00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:13.990] Think
[00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.070] of
[00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.190] like
[00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.410] a
[00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:14.710] Ferris
[00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.950] wheel.
[00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:15.650] So
[00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:15.830] the
[00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:16.170] formal
[00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:16.390] name
[00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.570] of
[00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:17.290] luminiferous
[00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:17.550] ether
[00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:17.810] really
[00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.990] just
[00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.150] means
[00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:18.350] the
[00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.770] light
[00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.350] carrying
[00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.670] or
[00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:19.770] the
[00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:20.210] light
[00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.630] bearing
[00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.010] ether.
[00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:21.270] This
[00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.390] was
[00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.590] the
[00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.150] medium
[00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:22.830] in
[00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.950] which
[00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:23.270] light
[00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.730] traveled,
[00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:24.270] in
[00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:24.470] which
[00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:25.230] everything,
[00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:25.550] all
[00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:25.730] of
[00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.930] the
[00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:26.150] physical
[00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:26.550] phenomena
[00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.210] were
[00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:27.570] immersed,
[00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:27.770] which
[00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:27.910] is
[00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.330] why
[00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.110] these
[00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.490] folks
[00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:29.630] would
[00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.870] never
[00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.050] have
[00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:30.250] said
[00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:31.050] the
[00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:31.270] stuff
[00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.370] of
[00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.450] the
[00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:31.750] world
[00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.070] is
[00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.730] elementary
[00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:33.150] particles
[00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:33.570] traveling
[00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:33.770] in
[00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.110] vacuum.
[00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:34.470] There
[00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.690] is
[00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:34.870] no
[00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:35.230] vacuum.
[00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:36.090] Everything
[00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:36.430] at
[00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:36.650] root
[00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:36.930] is
[00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:37.190] filled
[00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.410] with
[00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:37.690] ether.
[00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:38.110] That's
[00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.230] where
[00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.310] they
[00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.450] were
[00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:38.790] starting
[00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:39.030] from.
[00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.310] So
[00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.630] why
[00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.810] would
[00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:40.930] you
[00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:41.130] need
[00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:41.330] a
[00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.670] medium
[00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.290] for
[00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:42.670] light?
[00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.310] Again,
[00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.490] even
[00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.890] before
[00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.190] around
[00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.290] the
[00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:44.450] same
[00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.810] time
[00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.970] as
[00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:45.190] Thomas
[00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.530] Young
[00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:45.850] in
[00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:46.170] England,
[00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.730] a
[00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.930] number
[00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:47.070] of
[00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.290] French
[00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:47.690] scholars
[00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.890] had
[00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:48.190] found
[00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.370] that
[00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:48.510] the
[00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.010] speed
[00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.190] of
[00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.450] light,
[00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.590] the
[00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.790] speed
[00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:49.870] at
[00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.990] which
[00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.210] light
[00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.450] waves
[00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.970] travel,
[00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:51.710] depends
[00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.890] on
[00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:52.050] the
[00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:52.310] medium
[00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.450] in
[00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.170] which
[00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:53.390] they're
[00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.770] traveling.
[00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.190] In
[00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.370] fact,
[00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.510] they're
[00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:54.870] slower
[00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:55.110] in
[00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.370] water
[00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.570] than
[00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:55.690] in
[00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:56.010] air.
[00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.650] That's
[00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:56.970] opposite,
[00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:57.170] by
[00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:57.250] the
[00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:57.370] way,
[00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:57.510] than
[00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.890] sound
[00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:58.190] waves.
[00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:58.430] Sound
[00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.570] waves
[00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:58.830] travel
[00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:59.190] more
[00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.510] quickly
[00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.670] in
[00:22:59.670 --> 00:22:59.790] a
[00:22:59.790 --> 00:22:59.970] dense
[00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:00.230] medium.
[00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:01.090] And
[00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:01.270] that
[00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:01.450] led
[00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:01.570] to
[00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:01.770] things
[00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:01.990] like
[00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.570] Snell's
[00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.890] law,
[00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:03.310] the
[00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.730] whole
[00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:03.970] kind
[00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:04.350] of
[00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.690] set
[00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:05.050] of
[00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.470] knowledge
[00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.710] about
[00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:07.310] refraction
[00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.490] and
[00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.650] how
[00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:07.910] light
[00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:08.230] behaves
[00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.350] when
[00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.470] it
[00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.930] crosses
[00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:09.230] from
[00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.450] one
[00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:09.630] type
[00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.770] of
[00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.970] medium
[00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:10.150] to
[00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:10.470] another.
[00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:11.050] You
[00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:11.190] can
[00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.610] characterize
[00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:11.890] these
[00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:12.130] media
[00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:12.310] in
[00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.510] terms
[00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.690] of
[00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.070] what
[00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.830] index
[00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:14.210] of
[00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.790] refraction.
[00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.410] And
[00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:15.610] so
[00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.150] everything
[00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:16.450] about
[00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:16.590] the
[00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.950] behavior
[00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:17.090] of
[00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.230] these
[00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:17.650] waves
[00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:17.990] seemed
[00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.110] to
[00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.430] depend
[00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.650] on
[00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:18.830] the
[00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.190] medium
[00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.470] through
[00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.710] which
[00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.850] they
[00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.970] were
[00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:20.430] traveling.
[00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:21.190] So
[00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.290] there
[00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:21.430] must
[00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.590] be
[00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.810] some
[00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:22.010] kind
[00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.150] of
[00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:22.730] baseline
[00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:23.190] or
[00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.810] reference
[00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.170] medium,
[00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:24.390] the
[00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.730] ether,
[00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.430] with
[00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.730] respect
[00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.990] to
[00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.130] which
[00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:26.310] any
[00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.410] of
[00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:26.570] these
[00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:27.410] deviations
[00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:27.610] would
[00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:27.750] then
[00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.910] be
[00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:28.270] measured.
[00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:29.610] So
[00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:30.050] water
[00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:30.590] is
[00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:31.110] one
[00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.330] type
[00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:31.450] of
[00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:31.710] medium.
[00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.890] But
[00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:32.050] even
[00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:32.170] if
[00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:32.270] you
[00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.550] take
[00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:32.690] all
[00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.810] the
[00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:33.050] water
[00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:33.370] away
[00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:33.650] and
[00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:33.870] have
[00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:34.010] a
[00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.170] kind
[00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:34.230] of
[00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.830] evacuated
[00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:35.230] chamber,
[00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.810] you
[00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.950] still
[00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:36.110] have
[00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.330] light
[00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:36.590] waves
[00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.030] traveling
[00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.390] in
[00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:37.590] the
[00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.250] remaining
[00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:38.710] ether.
[00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.990] That
[00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.150] was
[00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:39.290] how
[00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:39.430] they
[00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.050] organized
[00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:40.310] these
[00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.770] studies.
[00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.270] Or
[00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.410] so
[00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:41.550] much
[00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:41.690] for
[00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.890] light.
[00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:42.630] What
[00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.810] about
[00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:43.050] other
[00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:43.250] things
[00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.410] like
[00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:43.870] electricity
[00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:44.590] and
[00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.190] magnetism?
[00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.790] So
[00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:46.070] again,
[00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:46.570] during
[00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.270] Faraday's
[00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.990] early
[00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.310] career,
[00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.490] by
[00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:48.650] this
[00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:48.790] point,
[00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.910] he
[00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:49.050] was
[00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:49.330] already
[00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:49.690] a
[00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:49.830] kind
[00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:50.090] of
[00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.390] ensconced
[00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:51.530] to
[00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:51.610] the
[00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:51.770] Royal
[00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.250] Institution,
[00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.550] still
[00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:52.870] working
[00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:53.230] closely
[00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.390] with
[00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.570] people
[00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:53.910] like
[00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:54.570] Humphrey
[00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.410] Davy.
[00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:56.110] There
[00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.230] was
[00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.450] a
[00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.970] headline
[00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:57.470] grabbing
[00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.090] event,
[00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.790] not
[00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.210] found
[00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.570] in
[00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.850] Britain,
[00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:00.010] but
[00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:00.310] actually
[00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.690] nearby
[00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:01.430] in
[00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.870] Denmark.
[00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.490] So
[00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:02.610] when
[00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:02.990] another
[00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.370] natural
[00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:03.830] philosopher,
[00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.130] Hans
[00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.430] Christian
[00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.790] Ørsted,
[00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.530] was
[00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:05.750] giving
[00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.890] a
[00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:06.130] public
[00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:06.430] lecture,
[00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.690] very
[00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:06.950] much
[00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:07.150] like
[00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:07.290] at
[00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:07.410] the
[00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:07.590] Royal
[00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.050] Institution,
[00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:08.350] same
[00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.670] kind
[00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:08.810] of
[00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:09.150] format.
[00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.390] These
[00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.510] were
[00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.790] popular
[00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:10.210] throughout
[00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:10.550] Europe.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:11.660] Ørsted
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:11.860] was
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:12.040] giving
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.200] a
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.480] public
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:12.800] lecture,
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:12.980] and
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.140] he
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:13.740] accidentally
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.140] discovered
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:14.400] in
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:14.560] the
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:14.760] midst
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:14.900] of
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.040] his
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.440] talk
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:15.940] something
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.100] that
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:16.200] he
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:16.440] really
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:16.640] didn't
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.160] expect.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:17.600] He
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:17.700] had
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:17.880] an
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.400] apparatus
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:18.640] that
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:18.800] looked
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:18.980] a
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:19.160] lot
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.400] like
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:19.740] this,
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:19.980] a
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.180] kind
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.380] of
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.060] conducting
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.740] coil.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:22.420] So
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:22.520] there's
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:22.900] a
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.360] conducting
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:23.860] wire.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:25.480] And
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:25.620] he
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:25.780] had
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.140] nearby
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:26.960] a
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.420] compass,
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:27.780] so
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:28.060] a
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.440] magnetic
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:28.860] needle.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:29.660] And
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:29.760] he
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:29.940] found
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.120] that
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:30.520] when
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:30.920] current
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.120] was
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.480] flowing
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:31.660] through
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:31.820] the
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.140] wire,
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:32.440] the
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:32.860] needle
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.440] would
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:33.600] be
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.380] deflected.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:34.800] He
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:34.920] did
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.080] not
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:35.320] expect
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:35.440] that
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:35.560] at
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:35.780] all.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.020] None
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.100] of
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:36.180] his
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:36.380] audience
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:36.720] expected
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:36.960] that.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.140] No

[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.120] else
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.460] expected
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:38.740] that.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:39.420] Somehow
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:39.720] that
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.300] electric
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:40.720] currents,
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:40.920] the
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.340] flow
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:41.520] of
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.000] electricity,
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:42.920] could
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.380] affect,
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:44.560] could
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:44.860] induce
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.220] magnetic
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:45.740] effects.
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:45.860] It
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:45.980] could
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.300] change
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:46.400] the
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:46.640] behavior
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:46.760] of
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:46.900] that
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.520] magnetic
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.040] needle
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:48.620] of
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:48.740] the
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.020] compass.
[00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.550] This
[00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:50.930] became
[00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:51.410] headline
[00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:51.750] news.
[00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:52.030] If
[00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:52.150] there
[00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:52.290] had
[00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:52.430] been
[00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.810] 19th
[00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:53.050] century

[00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.490] this
[00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:53.590] would
[00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.690] have
[00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.970] broken
[00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:54.310] Twitter.
[00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:54.930] Hashtag
[00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:55.550] the
[00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:55.690] needle
[00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:55.910] move.
[00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.150] I'm
[00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:56.270] sure.
[00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.550] This
[00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:56.630] was
[00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.770] like
[00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:57.250] literally
[00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:57.490] whatever
[00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:57.710] was
[00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.930] super
[00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:58.150] exciting,
[00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.990] including
[00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.270] people
[00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.510] like
[00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.090] Michael
[00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:00.690] Faraday.
[00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:01.190] This
[00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.350] was
[00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.530] for
[00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:01.890] Faraday
[00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:02.470] exactly
[00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.690] this
[00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:02.850] kind
[00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:02.970] of

[00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:04.030] of
[00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:04.370] forces
[00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.550] that
[00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:04.630] he
[00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.730] was
[00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.870] so
[00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:05.150] interested
[00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:05.290] in,
[00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.550] partly
[00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:05.790] from
[00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:05.990] his
[00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.630] Sandemanian
[00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.990] faith,
[00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:07.570] partly
[00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:07.790] because
[00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:07.890] he
[00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:07.990] was
[00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.090] a
[00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.370] natural
[00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:08.750] philosopher
[00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.990] of
[00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.110] his
[00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.470] time.
[00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:10.190] So
[00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.430] not
[00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.590] only
[00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.770] does
[00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:10.890] he
[00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:11.190] quickly
[00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.930] replicate

[00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:13.030] he
[00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:13.530] separately
[00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:13.990] finds
[00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.090] that
[00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.190] he
[00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.330] can
[00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.590] get
[00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:15.150] electric
[00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:15.530] current
[00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:15.850] to

[00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.210] a
[00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:17.450] compass
[00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:17.770] needle.
[00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.490] He
[00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:18.690] then
[00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:19.070] finds
[00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.330] the
[00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:19.750] inverse.
[00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.370] He
[00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:20.570] then
[00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:20.870] does,
[00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.130] as
[00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:21.350] shown
[00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.630] here,
[00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.850] he
[00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:22.150] takes
[00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:22.430] a
[00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.730] bar
[00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:23.210] magnet
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:23.900] and
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:24.100] starts
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:24.580] moving
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:24.740] it
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:24.800] in
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:24.920] a
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.200] pattern
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:25.720] near
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.040] a
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.400] conducting
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:26.940] coil
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.760] from
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:27.960] which
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.060] he
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.200] can
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:28.480] measure
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:28.760] the
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.160] current
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:29.440] as
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:29.580] an
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:29.900] ammeter
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.320] attached.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:30.980] And
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.120] he
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.380] finds
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:31.540] the
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:31.940] inverse
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.100] can
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:32.420] happen
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:32.620] as
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:32.840] well,
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.000] that
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.160] a
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:33.460] moving
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.120] magnet,
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:34.600] a
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:34.920] changing
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.460] magnetic
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.500] effect,
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.120] can
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:37.380] induce
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:37.540] an
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:37.860] electric
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.320] current.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.500] So
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:40.720] he's
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.180] investigating
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:41.720] induction,
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.160] both
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:42.380] sort
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:42.540] of
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.280] electric
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:43.700] currents
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.060] inducing
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:44.400] magnetic
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:44.820] effects,
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.200] magnetic
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.680] fields
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:45.860] or
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:46.180] magnetic
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:46.740] effects
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.140] inducing
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.540] electric
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:47.960] effects,
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:48.600] and
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:48.700] he
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:48.880] wants
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.000] to
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:49.120] kind
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.200] of
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:49.360] keep
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:49.720] track
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:49.860] of
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.020] this
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:50.300] stuff.
[00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:51.070] So
[00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.170] he
[00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:51.410] starts
[00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:51.790] sketching
[00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:51.930] these
[00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:52.250] helpful
[00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.730] doodles
[00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.930] that
[00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:53.050] he
[00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:53.290] calls
[00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:53.770] lines
[00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:53.990] of
[00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.470] force.
[00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:55.390] As
[00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:55.630] far
[00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.810] as
[00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:56.070] Faraday
[00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.210] was
[00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.490] concerned,
[00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.630] these
[00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.730] were
[00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.030] lines
[00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:57.210] of
[00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:57.550] force
[00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.010] to
[00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:58.450] depict
[00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:58.730] the
[00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:59.130] underlying
[00:25:59.130 --> 00:25:59.690] state
[00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.890] of
[00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:00.030] the
[00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:00.290] ether.
[00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.570] Remember,
[00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:01.210] everything
[00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:01.610] as
[00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.770] far
[00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:01.830] as
[00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.950] he's
[00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:02.330] concerned
[00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.930] is
[00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:03.130] what's
[00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:03.270] going
[00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:03.450] on
[00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:03.550] with
[00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:03.670] the
[00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:04.050] underlying
[00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:04.410] ether.
[00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.130] So
[00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:05.270] it

[00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:13.290] That's
[00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:13.510] if

[00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:21.670] So
[00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:21.790] he

[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:30.200] And

[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:34.500] He'd

[00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:30.970] divide
[00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:31.150] by
[00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:31.350] the

[00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:35.170] goes
[00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:35.390] by

[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:37.760] So

[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:38.440] should

[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:39.840] That

[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:41.940] Faraday
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.480] because
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:42.600] he
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:42.720] had

[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:46.460] really
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:46.760] just
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.140] in

[00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:49.910] there
[00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:50.050] was
[00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:50.650] this

[00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:55.950] We

[00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:56.410] call

[00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.550] exactly
[00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:04.950] as
[00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:05.490] Faraday
[00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:05.650] had
[00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:05.810] kind

[00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.970] and
[00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:10.150] how
[00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:10.410] that
[00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:11.250] strain
[00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:11.490] would
[00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:11.670] be

[00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:14.130] distance.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:15.820] So
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:16.160] Faraday
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:16.340] went
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:16.500] on.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:16.680] Remember,
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:16.740] he
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:16.840] was

[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.180] excited
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:17.400] not

[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:18.600] like
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:18.960] electricity,
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.480] but
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:19.700] also
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:19.880] about
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.420] magnetism.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.120] What
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.200] if
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:21.300] you
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:21.640] plop

[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:24.560] Then
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:24.840] he
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.480] could
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:25.660] do

[00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.970] And
[00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:33.070] he
[00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.370] realized

[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:17.740] He
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.180] introduces
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:18.420] this

[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:19.900] something

[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:24.180] We

[00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:26.710] It
[00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:27.190] largely
[00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.570] comes
[00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:27.670] as

[00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:36.810] So

[00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:46.770] What

[00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:54.050] This

[00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:56.270] It's
[00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:56.690] just
[00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:57.330] shorthand

[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.580] just
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:04.980] a

[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:06.340] Or
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:06.480] did
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:06.880] Faraday

[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:07.580] it
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:07.700] was

[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:09.800] And
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:09.880] it
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.000] was

[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.040] from
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:16.220] which
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:16.360] the
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:16.560] world
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:16.740] was
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.020] made.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:17.160] And
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.260] we'll
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:17.460] talk
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:17.620] about
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:17.840] this
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.540] in
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:18.780] some
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:18.940] more
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.200] detail
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.460] over
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:19.880] coming
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.180] class
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:20.540] sessions.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:21.660] Faraday
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:21.860] thought
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:21.960] he
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.200] found
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:22.380] like
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:22.540] the
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:22.980] golden
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.440] proof
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:23.660] in
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.560] 1845,
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:24.720] but
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:24.860] now
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:24.960] he
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:24.980] was
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.060] a
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:25.160] much
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:25.340] more
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:25.600] senior
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.060] researcher.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:27.640] How
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:27.820] could
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:27.920] you
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.200] demonstrate
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:28.360] the
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:28.460] ether
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:28.620] was
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:28.920] real?
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:29.640] Well,
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.240] let's
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.040] study
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.220] the
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:31.660] interaction
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:31.800] between
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.280] magnetic
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:32.840] fields
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.520] and
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:33.660] the
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.060] behavior
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.300] of
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:34.560] light,
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:34.870] in
[00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:35.230] a
[00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.230] particular
[00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.970] polarized
[00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:36.650] light.
[00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:37.390] This
[00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:37.490] is
[00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.670] now
[00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:37.930] known
[00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:38.050] as
[00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:38.250] the
[00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:38.610] Faraday
[00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:38.990] effect
[00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.130] or
[00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:39.210] the
[00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:39.450] Faraday
[00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:39.870] rotation,
[00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:40.090] which
[00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:40.150] is
[00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:40.310] one
[00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.370] of
[00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.490] these
[00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.650] things
[00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:40.890] that's
[00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.210] literally
[00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:41.430] still
[00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.510] in
[00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.630] our
[00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.970] textbooks.
[00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.170] We
[00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:42.310] use
[00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.410] it
[00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:42.530] all
[00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:42.650] the
[00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:42.970] time.
[00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.850] It
[00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:44.110] comes
[00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.330] from
[00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.850] Faraday's
[00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:45.150] efforts
[00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:45.390] to
[00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:45.830] prove
[00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.990] to
[00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.390] himself
[00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:46.570] and
[00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:46.710] his
[00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:47.090] colleagues
[00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.670] that
[00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:47.810] we
[00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.910] are
[00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:48.170] all
[00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:48.510] immersed
[00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:48.890] in
[00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:49.090] this
[00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:49.750] elastic
[00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.470] bendable
[00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.990] ether.
[00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.230] So
[00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.350] Faraday
[00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.450] and
[00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.590] his
[00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.910] peers,
[00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.190] the
[00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.550] idea
[00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:54.850] was
[00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:55.050] the
[00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:55.470] following,
[00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:56.010] that
[00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:56.110] if
[00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.190] you
[00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.530] put
[00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:56.750] the
[00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:57.110] ether
[00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.470] under
[00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:58.050] local
[00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:58.730] strain
[00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:59.050] by
[00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.050] putting
[00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:01.230] a
[00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.490] local
[00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.830] magnetic
[00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.410] field
[00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:02.870] in
[00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:03.070] some
[00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.290] region
[00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:03.430] of
[00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.710] space,
[00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.430] that
[00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.770] magnetic
[00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:05.110] field
[00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.270] will
[00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:05.450] have
[00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:05.550] a
[00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:05.710] kind
[00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.830] of
[00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:06.330] twisting
[00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:06.630] or
[00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:07.310] curling
[00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.770] effect,
[00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.910] a
[00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:08.030] kind
[00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:08.170] of
[00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:08.830] torsion
[00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.570] on
[00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:09.690] the
[00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:10.090] underlying
[00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:10.450] ether.
[00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:11.110] And
[00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.230] then
[00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.410] this
[00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:11.690] light
[00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:11.910] wave
[00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:12.070] is
[00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.410] traveling
[00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:12.690] through
[00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:12.870] this
[00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:13.030] kind
[00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.130] of
[00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:13.750] deformed
[00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:14.230] local
[00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.450] bit
[00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.530] of
[00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:14.630] the
[00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.870] ether.
[00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:15.110] So
[00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.390] its
[00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:15.790] behavior
[00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:16.010] will
[00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.330] change.
[00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:16.450] In
[00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:16.530] a
[00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:16.930] particular,
[00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:18.010] what's
[00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.190] called
[00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.350] the
[00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.750] plane
[00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:18.950] of
[00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:19.530] polarization,
[00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.730] the
[00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:21.110] direction
[00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.450] in
[00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:21.690] which
[00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:22.050] its
[00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.110] wave
[00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.390] is
[00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.070] waving
[00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.810] will
[00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:25.270] rotate.
[00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:25.510] There'll
[00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:25.570] be
[00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:25.730] some
[00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:26.210] angles
[00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.490] shown
[00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:26.650] here
[00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:26.770] as
[00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:26.870] the
[00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:27.130] angle
[00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:27.530] beta.
[00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.250] So
[00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.390] if
[00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:28.490] the
[00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:29.230] field
[00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.650] starts
[00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:29.830] out,
[00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:29.990] the
[00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.210] wave
[00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:30.490] starts
[00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:30.690] out
[00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:30.970] waving
[00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:31.130] in
[00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.350] one
[00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.750] direction,
[00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:32.290] it
[00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:32.450] will
[00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.750] literally
[00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:33.010] be
[00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:33.510] rotated
[00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:33.690] by
[00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:33.930] some
[00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:34.310] angle.
[00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:34.830] The
[00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:35.110] amount
[00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.210] of
[00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.550] rotation
[00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:35.870] depends
[00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.970] on
[00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:36.070] the
[00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.330] strength
[00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:36.470] of
[00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.550] the
[00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:36.830] field
[00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:37.090] and
[00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:37.250] the
[00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.650] distance
[00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:37.970] through
[00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:38.290] which
[00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:39.350] this
[00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.930] ether
[00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:40.070] is
[00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.230] under
[00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.730] tension.
[00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:41.490] This
[00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:41.570] is
[00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.710] not
[00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.870] just
[00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.990] a
[00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.110] good
[00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.310] idea
[00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.450] for
[00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:43.190] 1845.
[00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:43.910] It's
[00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:44.410] how
[00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:44.570] we
[00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.730] make
[00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:44.950] sense
[00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:45.030] of
[00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:45.110] the
[00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.270] world
[00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:45.690] today,
[00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.110] minus
[00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.330] the
[00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.530] ether
[00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:47.850] part.
[00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:48.030] But
[00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:48.130] it
[00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:48.470] comes
[00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.610] from
[00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:48.730] trying
[00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:48.810] to
[00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:48.910] figure
[00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:49.010] out,
[00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:49.090] is
[00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:49.210] the
[00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:49.410] ether
[00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:49.750] real?
[00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.450] Just
[00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.730] last
[00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:50.930] year,
[00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:51.050] I
[00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:51.210] had
[00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:51.430] fun
[00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.650] working
[00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:51.870] with
[00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:52.030] a
[00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:52.270] really
[00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:52.590] terrific
[00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.890] UROP
[00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:53.190] student.
[00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.570] Some
[00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.630] of
[00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.670] you
[00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:53.810] might
[00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:54.110] know
[00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.630] Max
[00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.130] Doshner,
[00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:56.090] he
[00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.190] and
[00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.350] my
[00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.870] friend

[00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:57.610] in
[00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:57.850] physics.
[00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:58.630] We
[00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:59.190] use
[00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.330] this
[00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.710] exact
[00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:00.010] same
[00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:00.450] phenomenon
[00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:00.810] that
[00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:01.130] an

[00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:02.350] will
[00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:03.590] rotate
[00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.830] the

[00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.230] of

[00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:04.910] of
[00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:05.230] light,
[00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:06.530] not
[00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:06.770] to
[00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:06.970] talk
[00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:07.110] about
[00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.250] the
[00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:07.470] ether,
[00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:07.790] but
[00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:07.990] as
[00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.070] a
[00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.190] way
[00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.370] to

[00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:10.310] indefinitely.
[00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.690] So
[00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:10.870] in
[00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.970] the
[00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:11.110] sort
[00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.370] of

[00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:12.530] physics
[00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:12.690] of
[00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:12.790] the
[00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.030] moment,
[00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:13.270] we're
[00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:13.550] still
[00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:13.790] going
[00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:14.050] back
[00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:14.250] to
[00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:14.490] Faraday
[00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:15.010] rotation,
[00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:15.710] and
[00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.910] yet
[00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:16.310] Faraday
[00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.550] thought
[00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:16.670] this
[00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:16.750] is
[00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.810] a
[00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:16.890] way
[00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:17.050] of

[00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:17.750] the
[00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.910] ether.
[00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:18.330] I
[00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:18.730] just
[00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:19.190] love
[00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.390] that.
[00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.590] We're
[00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.670] going
[00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:19.690] to
[00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:19.790] see
[00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:19.990] many
[00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.290] examples
[00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:20.430] of
[00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.650] that
[00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.250] throughout
[00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:21.470] the
[00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.770] class.
[00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.670] Let
[00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:22.770] me
[00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:22.970] wrap
[00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:23.090] up
[00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.230] the
[00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.550] Faraday
[00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:23.750] part,
[00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.870] then
[00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.970] I'll
[00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:24.170] pause
[00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:24.350] again
[00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.470] for
[00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.590] some
[00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.690] more
[00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:24.930] questions.
[00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:25.770] So
[00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:26.170] Faraday,
[00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:26.290] as
[00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:26.410] we've
[00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:26.610] seen,
[00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:26.810] worked
[00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.950] on
[00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:27.050] a
[00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:27.530] variety
[00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:27.850] of
[00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:28.410] phenomena,
[00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.850] what
[00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:29.030] we
[00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:29.230] would
[00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.490] call
[00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:29.950] separately
[00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:30.450] chemistry
[00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:30.710] and
[00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:31.110] optics,
[00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.110] electrolysis,
[00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.550] even
[00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.130] physiology,
[00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:33.730] let
[00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:33.870] alone
[00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:34.330] electricity
[00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:34.450] and
[00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:34.810] magnetism.
[00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:35.610] He
[00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:35.810] was
[00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:36.530] especially
[00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:36.810] interested
[00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:37.010] in
[00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.170] the
[00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.190] interconvertibility
[00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.430] of
[00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.810] forces,
[00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:39.390] partly
[00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.050] a
[00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:40.350] compelling
[00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:40.670] case
[00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:40.790] that
[00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:40.870] he
[00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:41.210] made,
[00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:41.710] this
[00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:41.870] kind
[00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.990] of
[00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.350] resonated
[00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.870] especially
[00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:43.310] closely
[00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.530] with
[00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:43.790] his
[00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:45.190] his

[00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.570] of

[00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:46.970] views,
[00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.170] his
[00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:47.870] Sandemanian
[00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:48.650] views,
[00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.690] and
[00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:49.830] that
[00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.950] there
[00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:50.050] was
[00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:50.190] this
[00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.330] kind
[00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:50.510] of

[00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.790] of

[00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.070] Faraday
[00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.230] was
[00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.570] never
[00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:54.950] trained
[00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:55.110] in

[00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:55.990] He
[00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.250] had
[00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:56.550] really
[00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:56.750] just
[00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.970] the

[00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:57.510] of

[00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:57.870] of

[00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.550] like
[00:32:59.550 --> 00:32:59.670] we
[00:32:59.670 --> 00:32:59.870] saw
[00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:00.050] with
[00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:00.210] the

[00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:02.270] He
[00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:02.410] was

[00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.530] tinkerer.
[00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:03.710] He
[00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.850] had
[00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:04.390] tremendous

[00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:06.270] skills
[00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:06.490] and
[00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:06.710] also
[00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.970] great
[00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:07.490] cleverness.
[00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:08.330] He
[00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.850] became
[00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:09.110] this

[00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:12.430] at
[00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.510] a
[00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:12.830] university,
[00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.570] but
[00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:13.810] being
[00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:14.030] kind
[00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:14.190] of

[00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:15.950] and
[00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:16.130] then
[00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.510] essentially
[00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.090] apprenticed
[00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.670] as

[00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.310] He
[00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.710] introduces
[00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.850] these
[00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:23.070] things
[00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.250] which
[00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:23.370] we
[00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:23.650] still
[00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:23.950] use
[00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:24.070] to
[00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.230] this
[00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.470] day,
[00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:24.790] like
[00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:25.170] lines
[00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:25.330] of

[00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:25.870] and
[00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:26.030] then
[00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:26.550] fields.
[00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:27.390] For
[00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:27.910] Faraday,
[00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:28.090] these
[00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:28.190] are
[00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.350] ways
[00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.490] of
[00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.030] characterizing
[00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:29.230] the
[00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:29.570] one
[00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.830] big
[00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:30.410] prize
[00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:30.670] of
[00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:31.010] natural
[00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:31.410] studies,
[00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:31.630] meaning
[00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:31.850] the
[00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:32.130] ether,
[00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:32.910] the
[00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.250] medium
[00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:33.510] within
[00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:33.830] which
[00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:34.030] all
[00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:34.190] these
[00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.390] things
[00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:34.910] unfolded,
[00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:34.970] and
[00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:35.150] the
[00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:35.610] reason,
[00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:36.030] as
[00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.170] far
[00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:36.270] as
[00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:36.530] Faraday
[00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:36.670] was
[00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.030] concerned,
[00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:37.570] why
[00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:37.750] there
[00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.890] could
[00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:38.030] be
[00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.230] this
[00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.270] interconvertibility
[00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:39.890] and
[00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:40.210] unity.
[00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:41.150] So
[00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:41.290] in
[00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:41.550] place
[00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:41.670] of
[00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:42.150] Newtonian
[00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:42.610] action
[00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:42.770] at
[00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:42.870] a
[00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:43.150] distance
[00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:43.430] that
[00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.790] somehow
[00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:44.210] one
[00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:44.430] object
[00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.690] could
[00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:45.530] instantaneously
[00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.010] affect
[00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:46.210] or
[00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:46.410] exert
[00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:46.550] a
[00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:46.830] force
[00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:47.050] on
[00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:47.350] another
[00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.750] one,
[00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:48.810] Faraday
[00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:49.050] starts
[00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:49.490] explaining
[00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.010] all
[00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:50.330] physical
[00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.150] phenomena.
[00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.430] He
[00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.590] has
[00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.730] the
[00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:52.110] ambition
[00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.890] to
[00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:53.090] explain
[00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.330] everything
[00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.470] in
[00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.590] terms
[00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.650] of
[00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:53.750] these
[00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.310] local
[00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.790] fields.
[00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:54.950] There's
[00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:55.150] a
[00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:55.490] local
[00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.990] disturbance
[00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.410] here
[00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:56.710] at
[00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:57.050] position
[00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:57.350] x
[00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.570] equals
[00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:58.010] one,
[00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.770] and
[00:33:58.770 --> 00:33:58.870] it
[00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:59.130] can
[00:33:59.130 --> 00:33:59.970] convey
[00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:00.490] effects
[00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:00.650] to
[00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:00.850] its
[00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:01.190] nearest
[00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.590] neighbors
[00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.990] point
[00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.190] by
[00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.610] point.
[00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.190] So
[00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.250] you
[00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:03.330] have
[00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:03.430] to
[00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.650] study
[00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:03.810] how
[00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:04.010] these
[00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:04.510] fields
[00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.170] change
[00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:05.390] over
[00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:05.750] time
[00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.890] and
[00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:06.110] spread
[00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.290] out
[00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:06.430] through
[00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.810] space.
[00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:07.130] Everything
[00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.290] is
[00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:07.450] now
[00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:07.590] meant
[00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.650] to
[00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:07.750] be
[00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:08.270] local
[00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.750] fields,
[00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:09.410] not
[00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:09.750] action
[00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.890] at
[00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:09.990] a
[00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.350] distance.
[00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:10.850] Let
[00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:10.950] me
[00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:11.190] pause
[00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.310] there
[00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.490] again
[00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:11.590] and
[00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:11.750] ask
[00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.810] him
[00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.930] any
[00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:12.150] questions.
[00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.350] See
[00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:12.470] at
[00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.590] least
[00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:12.770] one
[00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.950] more
[00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:13.170] item
[00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:13.310] in
[00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.650] the
[00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:14.010] chat.
[00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.910] Any
[00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:16.190] questions
[00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.330] on
[00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:16.430] the
[00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.670] Faraday
[00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:16.950] material?
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:22.820] Very
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:23.020] good.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:23.160] So
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:23.300] it
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:23.620] was
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:23.920] common
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.080] to
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:24.320] attend
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:24.480] the
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:24.720] public
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.040] science
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:25.300] lectures.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:25.420] In
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:25.680] fact,
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:25.780] it
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:25.920] was
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.120] seen
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:26.260] as
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:26.360] a
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:26.500] way
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:26.640] of
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:26.860] being
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.060] kind
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:27.160] of
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:27.540] elegant.
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.300] Again,
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:28.540] there's
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:28.820] really
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.180] fascinating
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:29.440] work
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:29.720] on
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:29.840] the

[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:50.740] For

[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:57.360] for
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:57.520] many
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:57.640] in
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:57.780] this

[00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:58.200] the
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:58.400] idea
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:58.600] was
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:58.780] that
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.520] learning
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:34:59.840] about

[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.280] twitch,
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:03.880] or
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.240] how
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:04.620] a

[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.060] magnet
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:06.260] can
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:06.620] change,
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:07.080] can
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:07.300] induce
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:07.580] electric
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:07.880] current.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:08.540] These
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:08.640] are
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:08.840] ways
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:08.980] of
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:09.140] kind
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:09.500] of
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.640] revealing
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.040] the
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:11.600] glory
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:11.800] of
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.140] God's
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.580] creation,
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:12.780] as
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:12.940] many
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:13.200] people
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:13.500] argued
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:13.640] at
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:13.700] the
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:13.940] time.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:14.500] So
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.660] it
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:14.680] was
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:14.820] seen
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.180] as
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:15.980] actually
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.160] a
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:16.420] function
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:16.540] of
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:16.660] kind
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:16.760] of
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.200] moral
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:17.500] or
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.500] spiritual
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.200] uplift.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:19.760] And
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.240] therefore,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:20.800] again,
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.140] according
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.320] to
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:21.440] the
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:21.640] kind
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.000] of
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.640] assumptions
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:22.840] that
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:22.920] we
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.080] might
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:23.240] say
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:23.720] prejudices
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:23.880] the
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.200] time,
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:24.780] therefore,
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.120] all
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:25.240] the
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:25.580] more
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:25.940] important
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.140] for
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:26.400] young
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:26.660] women
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:26.900] to
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.020] be
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:27.280] exposed
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:27.540] to
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:27.680] this
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:27.900] was
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.040] a
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.320] thinking
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:28.460] of
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:28.560] the
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:28.860] time,
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:29.520] with
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:29.720] their
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:29.960] kind
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.100] of
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:30.380] tender
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:30.720] moral
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.060] souls
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:31.180] that
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:31.360] needed
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:31.700] special
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.060] care,
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:32.340] again,
[00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.890] to
[00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:33.190] speak
[00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.550] in
[00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:34.010] their
[00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.290] idiom,
[00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.490] not
[00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.990] my
[00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.130] own.
[00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.930] So
[00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:36.090] there
[00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:36.290] actually
[00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.430] was
[00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.550] a
[00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.790] great
[00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:37.170] encouragement
[00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:37.350] for
[00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:37.550] women
[00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.710] to
[00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.010] attend
[00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.210] these
[00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.550] public
[00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.810] lectures,
[00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:39.330] not,
[00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:39.850] not,
[00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:39.990] as
[00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.070] you
[00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:40.190] might
[00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.530] expect,
[00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:40.950] to
[00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:41.090] move
[00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:41.210] into
[00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.350] the
[00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:41.770] laboratory,
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:42.720] not
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:42.880] to
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.100] do
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.280] the
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:43.500] work.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:43.700] That
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:43.920] was
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.360] an
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:44.680] almost
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.140] uniquely

[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.300] enclave
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:46.460] in
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:46.620] this
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:46.880] period,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.240] certainly
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:47.480] in
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:47.600] the
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:47.740] Royal
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:48.280] Institution.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.040] But
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:49.180] to
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.500] be
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:49.740] sort

[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:50.820] to
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:50.900] it,
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:50.960] to
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.080] be
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:51.340] part
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:51.440] of
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:51.580] the
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:52.000] broader
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.240] kind
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:52.340] of
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:52.680] polite
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.260] discussions,
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:53.720] it
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:53.840] was
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.120] one
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:54.340] way
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:54.480] of
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:54.740] showing
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:55.020] that
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:55.200] you
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:55.480] were,
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.380] you
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:56.460] know,
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:56.600] had
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:56.720] a
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:56.840] kind
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:56.920] of
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.420] appropriate
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:57.860] upbringing.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:58.060] And
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:58.200] again,
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:58.320] there's
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:58.620] lots
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:58.740] of
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:58.880] cool
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.100] stuff.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:35:59.240] I'd
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:35:59.300] be
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:35:59.440] glad
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:35:59.560] to
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:35:59.700] talk
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:35:59.880] more
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.000] about
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.160] that
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:00.260] or
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:00.440] send
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:00.600] some
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:00.980] references
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.160] or
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:01.280] more
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:01.420] reading.
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:02.020] The
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:02.200] short
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:02.340] answer
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:02.600] was,
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:02.920] yes,
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.100] to
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:03.480] attend
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:03.940] the
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:04.280] Christmas
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:04.620] lectures
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:04.780] at
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:04.960] Royal
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.300] Institute,
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:05.540] that
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:05.680] was
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:05.860] an
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.180] awesome
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:06.440] thing
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:06.600] to,
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:06.680] you
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:06.740] know,
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:06.960] bring
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.120] your
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:07.340] daughter
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:07.660] to.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:08.560] But,
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:08.960] but
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.140] at
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:09.300] the
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:09.720] time,
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:09.960] and
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.180] something
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:10.360] we'll
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:10.540] see
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.000] change,
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.020] rather
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:12.460] slowly,
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:12.640] but
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:12.940] change
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.080] over
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.360] time
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:13.560] throughout
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:13.800] the
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.120] semester.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.000] At
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.120] that
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:15.280] time,
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:15.400] it
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:15.520] was
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:15.920] not
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.240] something
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:16.400] that
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:16.500] was
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:16.660] seen
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:16.780] as
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:16.880] a
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.100] kind
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:17.360] of
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.480] acceptable
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:18.760] or
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.220] appropriate
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.080] day
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.500] job
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:20.700] or
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:20.920] a
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.220] career
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:21.700] path.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.080] So
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:22.260] that
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:22.400] was
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:22.580] a
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:22.820] very,
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:22.960] very
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.200] clear
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:23.480] gender
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.000] disparity,
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:24.700] but
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.100] a
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.360] great
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.040] openness
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.260] to
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:26.380] have
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:26.580] women
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:26.940] participate
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.240] in
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:27.420] that
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:27.780] limited
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.120] way
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:28.520] in
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:28.620] the
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:28.800] kind
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:28.980] of
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:29.540] public
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:29.900] lectures.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:30.200] So
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:30.520] very
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:30.700] good
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:30.940] question.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.080] We'll
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.160] come
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:31.360] back
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:31.440] to
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:31.700] that
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.180] theme
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:32.420] quite
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:32.540] a
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:32.680] lot.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:35.640] Great
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.140] questions.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:36.380] Oh,
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:36.640] that's
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:36.820] so
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.000] good.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:37.280] So
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:37.760] we'll
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:37.940] come
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:38.040] to
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:38.200] actually,
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:38.640] we'll
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:38.780] come
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:38.900] to
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:39.060] some
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:39.160] of
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:39.320] that
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:39.620] in
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:39.720] his
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:39.860] very
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.080] next
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:40.320] unit
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:40.660] right
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:40.960] now.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:41.240] So
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:41.740] partly
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:41.920] I'll
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.060] just
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:42.360] punt.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.000] But
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.140] the
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:43.320] short
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:43.460] answer
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:43.660] was
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:43.800] there
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:43.940] was
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:44.100] a
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:44.460] growing
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.520] recognition
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:45.920] in
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.100] just
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:46.260] this
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:46.580] time
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:46.940] period
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.300] among
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:47.740] many
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.280] influential
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:48.660] government
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.160] leaders,
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:49.780] not
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:49.960] only
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.100] in
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:50.300] Britain,
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:50.560] in
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.040] many
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.360] parts
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:51.480] of
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:51.620] Europe,
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:51.740] in
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:51.860] fact,
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.100] many
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.300] parts
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:52.400] of
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:52.520] the
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:52.840] world,
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:53.560] China
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:53.780] and
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:54.120] Japan,
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.360] certainly
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:55.620] North
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:55.980] America,
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:56.840] a
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.000] growing
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.380] recognition
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:57.660] by
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.380] this
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:58.740] during
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:58.960] this
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:36:59.200] exact
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:36:59.540] time
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.900] period,
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:00.880] that
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.280] many
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:01.720] nation
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.060] states
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:02.340] would
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:02.780] benefit
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.180] from
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:03.580] investing
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:03.880] in
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.080] something
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:04.300] what
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:04.380] we
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:04.480] would
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:04.620] now
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:04.820] call
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.160] science
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:05.320] and
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:05.820] technology
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:05.980] or
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.200] science
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:06.320] and
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:06.660] engineering.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:07.420] So
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:07.560] there
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:07.920] certainly
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.240] were
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:08.760] hot
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.100] button
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:09.540] issues,
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:09.760] then
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:09.940] as
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.320] now,
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.360] natural
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.880] evolution,
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:13.420] Darwin's
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:13.560] theory
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:13.720] of
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.000] evolution,
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:14.200] which
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:14.420] comes
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:14.680] just
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:14.900] around
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.080] this
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:15.360] time
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:15.580] first
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:15.900] published
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.180] in
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.040] 1859.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:17.820] That
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.200] becomes
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:18.300] yet
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:18.600] another
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.400] flashpoint
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:19.820] for,
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.280] for

[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:20.980] and
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:21.500] controversy.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.380] But
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:22.500] for
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:22.660] a
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:22.820] lot
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:22.900] of
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.020] this
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:23.280] work
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:23.360] in
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:23.480] what
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:23.620] we
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:23.740] would
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:23.900] now
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:24.100] call
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:24.260] the

[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.060] sciences,
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:25.760] as
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:25.880] we'll
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.040] see,
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:26.180] there
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:26.300] was
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:26.700] actually
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:26.900] a
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:27.160] kind
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:27.740] of
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:28.500] investment,
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:28.920] a

[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:29.560] kind
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:29.700] of

[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:30.840] in

[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:31.320] of
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:31.480] this
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:31.740] work,
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.020] not
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:32.400] across
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:32.580] the
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:32.780] board,
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.020] not
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:33.260] without
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:33.440] its

[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:33.920] hiccups
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.060] will
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:34.240] come
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:34.360] to
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:34.600] that.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:35.280] But
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:35.360] it
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:35.500] was
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:35.800] actually
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.020] a
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:36.380] turning
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:36.760] point
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.680] in
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.040] a

[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:38.420] kind
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:38.500] of
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:38.740] investment,
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.240] partly
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:39.660] because
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.460] many
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:40.600] of
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:40.760] these
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.120] places
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:41.340] were
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:41.640] undergoing
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:41.880] their

[00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:43.330] of

[00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:44.110] based
[00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:44.650] industrial
[00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:45.270] development.
[00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:45.410] And
[00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.510] we'll
[00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.670] see
[00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.850] that
[00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:46.090] actually
[00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.230] even
[00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.390] more
[00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.650] explicitly
[00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:46.790] in
[00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.870] the
[00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:47.070] next
[00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:47.510] class,
[00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:47.730] some
[00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:47.830] of
[00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:47.930] it
[00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:48.210] today
[00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:48.410] with
[00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.770] Maxwell,
[00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:49.370] and
[00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.470] in
[00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.550] the
[00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.710] next
[00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.890] semester
[00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:50.030] was
[00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.130] a
[00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:50.370] great
[00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:50.830] question.
[00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:51.270] It's
[00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.350] a
[00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:51.590] theme
[00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:51.730] we'll
[00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:52.010] trace
[00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.310] throughout
[00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.490] the
[00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.830] semester.
[00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:53.750] But
[00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:54.150] even
[00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.630] in
[00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.870] in
[00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:55.410] Faraday's
[00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:55.570] own
[00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:55.950] lifetime,
[00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:56.170] that
[00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:56.270] was
[00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.490] beginning
[00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:56.670] to
[00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.030] change
[00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.370] into
[00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:57.570] a
[00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:57.830] more
[00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:58.530] kind
[00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:58.710] of
[00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.410] a
[00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.810] higher
[00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:01.250] priority
[00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.390] and
[00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.730] investment
[00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:01.930] in
[00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:02.210] exactly
[00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.410] these
[00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:02.730] topics.
[00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:03.030] Great
[00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.330] question.
[00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:05.070] Any
[00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:05.290] others?
[00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:05.450] Should
[00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:05.590] we
[00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:05.750] should
[00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.850] we
[00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:05.990] press
[00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.170] on?
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.060] These
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:09.200] are
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:09.460] great.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:09.700] So
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:10.100] keep
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.220] them
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:10.460] coming.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:10.700] These
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:10.820] are
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.180] great
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:11.620] historical
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.120] questions
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:12.400] to
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:12.560] help
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:12.720] us
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:12.900] think
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.060] about
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:13.240] like,
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:13.400] what
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:13.600] was
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.240] different
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:14.520] back
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:14.740] then
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:14.940] what
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.140] might
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:15.240] have
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:15.380] been
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:15.700] similar.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:15.920] So
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.040] we're
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:16.100] gonna
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:16.320] keep
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:16.540] that
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:16.760] kind
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.220] of
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:17.740] back
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:17.920] and
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.120] forth
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:18.280] in
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:18.540] mind.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.100] As
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:19.220] we
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:19.400] enter
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:19.520] now
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:19.680] just
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:19.840] the
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.080] last
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:20.320] part
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:20.440] for
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:20.800] today's
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.140] class,
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:21.240] and
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:21.320] we'll
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:21.520] talk
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:21.860] about
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.600] William
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.020] Thompson
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:23.380] and
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:23.640] James
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:23.920] Clark
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.420] Maxwell.
[00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:25.730] So
[00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.970] as
[00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:26.670] we
[00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.950] saw
[00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:27.110] at
[00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:27.210] least
[00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:27.630] briefly,
[00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:28.350] Faraday
[00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:29.390] had
[00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.670] very
[00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.850] little
[00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.170] formal
[00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.510] training
[00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.650] in
[00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.050] mathematics.
[00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.990] And
[00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.110] he
[00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:32.310] used
[00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.450] very
[00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:32.670] little
[00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.870] in
[00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:33.010] his
[00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:33.170] own
[00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.590] studies,
[00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:33.830] his
[00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:34.050] very
[00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:34.550] voluminous
[00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.930] studies.
[00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:35.510] And
[00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.670] that's
[00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.790] not
[00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.930] so
[00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:36.270] surprising,
[00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:36.490] given
[00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:36.650] what
[00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.750] we
[00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.870] know
[00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:37.030] about
[00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.150] his
[00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.450] own
[00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:38.210] early
[00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:38.910] childhood
[00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:39.090] and
[00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:39.470] education.
[00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:40.310] There's
[00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.490] a
[00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:40.910] really
[00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:41.470] remarkable
[00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.990] shift,
[00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:42.210] one
[00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:42.350] that
[00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:42.550] I
[00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.750] still
[00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:43.090] find
[00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:44.030] unbelievably
[00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.730] fascinating.
[00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.870] So
[00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.990] we're
[00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.010] gonna
[00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:45.330] spend
[00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:45.670] quite
[00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.810] a
[00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:45.870] bit
[00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.930] of
[00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:46.110] time
[00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:46.390] talking
[00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.550] about
[00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.650] it
[00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:46.890] today
[00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:47.090] and
[00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:47.270] next
[00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.550] class
[00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.690] as
[00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.870] well.
[00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.530] This
[00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:49.110] amazing
[00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:49.490] shift
[00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.630] that
[00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.050] begins
[00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.010] really
[00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:51.490] late
[00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:51.690] in
[00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:52.170] Faraday's
[00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:52.430] own
[00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.850] lifetime
[00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:53.090] in
[00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:53.290] the
[00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:53.510] middle
[00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:54.050] decades
[00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.650] of
[00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.750] the
[00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:55.190] 19th
[00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.530] century.
[00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.990] It
[00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.230] doesn't
[00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.590] only
[00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:56.910] happen
[00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:57.110] in
[00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:57.310] Britain,
[00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:57.530] we're
[00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.570] going
[00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:57.670] to
[00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.830] look
[00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:57.950] at
[00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:58.030] it
[00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.150] because
[00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.310] it's
[00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.970] especially
[00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:59.370] kind
[00:38:59.370 --> 00:38:59.550] of
[00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:00.530] dramatic
[00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.910] or
[00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:01.270] kind
[00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.450] of
[00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:02.090] blown
[00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:02.230] out
[00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.310] of
[00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.690] proportion,
[00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:02.870] we
[00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:03.030] might
[00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.310] say,
[00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.950] in
[00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:04.190] Britain
[00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.370] at
[00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.670] places
[00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.910] like
[00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:05.230] Cambridge
[00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.650] University.
[00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:06.010] It's
[00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:06.330] happening
[00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:06.850] also
[00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:07.050] in
[00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:07.230] places
[00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.470] like
[00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.750] France
[00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.870] and
[00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:08.010] other
[00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:08.270] parts
[00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.350] of
[00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:08.430] the
[00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.590] world,
[00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:09.670] even
[00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.930] beyond
[00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:10.150] Europe.
[00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.650] But
[00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:11.310] Cambridge
[00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:11.570] in
[00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:11.790] Britain
[00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:12.010] gives
[00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:12.090] us
[00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:12.250] like
[00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:12.470] the
[00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.790] kind
[00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.910] of
[00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:13.410] capstone
[00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:13.830] picture
[00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:13.950] of
[00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:14.050] that
[00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:14.170] in
[00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:14.270] this
[00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.490] almost
[00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:14.710] like
[00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.050] pure
[00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.550] essence.
[00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.330] So
[00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:16.410] there's
[00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:16.590] a
[00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:16.930] real
[00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:17.210] sea
[00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.490] change
[00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:17.710] going
[00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.990] on
[00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.550] between
[00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.370] Faraday's
[00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.610] early
[00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:19.850] life
[00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:20.030] and
[00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.270] even
[00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.410] the
[00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:20.570] later
[00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:20.870] years
[00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:21.010] of
[00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:21.110] his
[00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:21.370] own
[00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:21.750] career
[00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.950] in
[00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:23.430] the
[00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.830] way
[00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:24.050] that
[00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:24.330] people
[00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:24.570] would
[00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:24.770] try
[00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:24.910] to
[00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:25.310] approach
[00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.690] natural
[00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.110] phenomena
[00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:26.470] like
[00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.950] electricity
[00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:27.310] and
[00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:27.470] that.
[00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:29.230] Two
[00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.470] kind
[00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.570] of
[00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:30.310] exemplars,
[00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.610] two
[00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:31.350] examples
[00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:31.710] of
[00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:31.950] that
[00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:32.370] shift
[00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:32.890] are
[00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:33.130] names
[00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:33.270] that
[00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.470] might
[00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.650] be
[00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.930] familiar
[00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:34.270] to
[00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.470] many
[00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.610] of
[00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:34.770] you,
[00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:35.130] and
[00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:35.230] we'll
[00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.510] spend
[00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.630] a
[00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.750] little
[00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.970] time
[00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:36.190] today
[00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.510] talking
[00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:36.690] about
[00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:36.850] some
[00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:36.950] of
[00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:37.050] their
[00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:37.350] work.
[00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:38.150] William
[00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.650] Thompson,
[00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:39.310] who
[00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:39.490] was
[00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:39.830] later
[00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:40.830] known
[00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:40.970] as
[00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:41.210] Lord
[00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.630] Kelvin,
[00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.890] that's
[00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:42.010] the
[00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:42.230] same
[00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.590] Kelvin
[00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:42.870] from
[00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:43.090] the
[00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:43.430] Kelvin
[00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:44.870] temperature
[00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:45.170] scale,
[00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:45.510] absolute
[00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.950] temperature
[00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:46.270] familiar
[00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:46.490] to
[00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.610] you
[00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:46.690] and
[00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:47.210] many
[00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.370] other
[00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:47.630] things.
[00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:48.810] So
[00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:49.750] Thompson
[00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:50.010] on
[00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:50.210] one
[00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.430] hand
[00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.590] and
[00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:50.810] James
[00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:51.050] Clark
[00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.370] Maxwell
[00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:51.490] on
[00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:51.550] the
[00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.750] other.
[00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.350] Again,
[00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:52.510] I'm
[00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:52.650] sure
[00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:53.030] Maxwell,
[00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.310] a
[00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:53.550] familiar
[00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.930] name,
[00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:54.410] things
[00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.570] like
[00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:54.970] Maxwell's
[00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:55.330] equations
[00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:55.630] and
[00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.750] all
[00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.870] the
[00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:56.110] rest.
[00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.790] So
[00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:57.010] these
[00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:57.210] two
[00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:57.490] folks
[00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:57.750] were
[00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:58.170] about
[00:39:58.170 --> 00:39:58.830] two
[00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:59.370] generations
[00:39:59.370 --> 00:39:59.890] younger
[00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:00.210] than
[00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:00.590] Faraday.
[00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.750] They
[00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.870] were
[00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:01.190] coming
[00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.350] of
[00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:01.630] age
[00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:02.070] when
[00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:02.390] Faraday
[00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.590] was
[00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:03.210] already
[00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:03.910] a
[00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:04.170] well
[00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:04.490]-known
[00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:05.230] natural
[00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.850] philosopher.
[00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.690] They
[00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:07.210] pick
[00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:07.470] up
[00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.790] on
[00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:08.250] Faraday's
[00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:08.510] work.
[00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.670] They
[00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.850] were
[00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:09.370] avid
[00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:09.790] readers
[00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:10.310] of
[00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.770] Faraday's
[00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:11.050] books,
[00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:11.390] often
[00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:12.050] monographs,
[00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:12.230] not
[00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.390] just
[00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.510] his
[00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.870] articles.
[00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.650] And
[00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:13.750] they
[00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:14.010] begin
[00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:14.210] to
[00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.690] translate
[00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.950] it
[00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:15.170] into
[00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.430] a

[00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:18.250] that
[00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:18.670] Faraday
[00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:19.170] had
[00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:19.850] no
[00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:20.250] inkling
[00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:20.410] of
[00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:20.770] whatsoever.
[00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:21.850] Turns
[00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:22.010] out
[00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.370] both
[00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.770] Thompson
[00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:23.010] and
[00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:23.330] Maxwell
[00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:23.670] were
[00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.150] born
[00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.350] in
[00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:24.750] Scotland.
[00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:25.050] They
[00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.170] were
[00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:25.450] not
[00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:25.730] from
[00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:26.050] London
[00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:26.230] or
[00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.350] the
[00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:26.630] immediate
[00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.990] English
[00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.510] surroundings.
[00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:28.250] They
[00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:28.310] were
[00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.510] both
[00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:28.850] Scottish
[00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:29.190] born.
[00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.710] They
[00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.030] both
[00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.390] moved
[00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.730] to
[00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:32.090] Cambridge
[00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:32.310] for
[00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:32.490] their
[00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:32.810] formal
[00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:33.250] university
[00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:33.690] training
[00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:34.630] in
[00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.730] the
[00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:34.850] middle
[00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:35.230] decades
[00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:35.430] of
[00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.530] the
[00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:35.950] 19th
[00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:36.270] century.
[00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:38.130] So
[00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:38.490] both
[00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:38.830] Thompson
[00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:38.990] and
[00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.210] Maxwell
[00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:39.510] became
[00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:40.050] deeply
[00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:40.430] involved
[00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.750] coming
[00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.950] to
[00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:41.410] exactly
[00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:41.570] the
[00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:41.810] question
[00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:41.890] that
[00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:42.010] was
[00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:42.230] raised
[00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.470] just
[00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.610] in
[00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:42.730] that
[00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.050] last
[00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:43.530] question
[00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:43.870] period.
[00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:44.530] They
[00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:44.770] became
[00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:45.170] deeply
[00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.530] involved
[00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.770] with
[00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.910] what
[00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:46.050] we
[00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:46.250] might
[00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:46.490] call
[00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.770] kind
[00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:46.950] of
[00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.150] engineering
[00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.710] aspects
[00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.910] or
[00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:49.570] applications
[00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:50.010] of
[00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:50.370] natural
[00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:50.930] philosophy
[00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:51.850] all
[00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:52.110] around
[00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:52.250] the
[00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.510] physics
[00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.630] of
[00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.770] the
[00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:53.050] ether.
[00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:53.450] They
[00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.670] had
[00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.930] both
[00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:54.090] had
[00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:54.430] very

[00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:56.930] only
[00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:57.070] when
[00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:57.150] they
[00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.310] were
[00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:57.810] university
[00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:58.270] students,
[00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:58.930] they
[00:40:58.930 --> 00:40:59.090] were
[00:40:59.090 --> 00:40:59.590] pursuing
[00:40:59.590 --> 00:40:59.870] these
[00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:00.330] very
[00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:00.790] fancy,
[00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:01.230] sophisticated,

[00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:02.250] of

[00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.890] to
[00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:04.330] electricity,
[00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:05.030] magnetism,
[00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:05.470] and
[00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.590] the
[00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:05.810] physics
[00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.970] of
[00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:06.030] the
[00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.290] ether,
[00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:06.950] not
[00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:07.410] only
[00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:07.570] for
[00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:07.690] the
[00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:07.890] sake
[00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:08.030] of
[00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.230] pure
[00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.830] mathematics.
[00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:09.090] As
[00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:09.230] we'll
[00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.450] see,
[00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.610] they
[00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:09.790] were
[00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:10.330] deeply
[00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:10.810] involved
[00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:11.030] in
[00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.210] very
[00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.610] practical
[00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:11.970] ways
[00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.130] with
[00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.570] things
[00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:13.790] that
[00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:14.230] governments
[00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.490] wanted
[00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:14.650] to
[00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:14.830] pay
[00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:15.050] for,
[00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.410] like
[00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:16.090] telegraphy
[00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:16.190] and
[00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.410] other
[00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:17.130] practical

[00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:18.350]-technical
[00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:18.870] devices.
[00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:19.690] So
[00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:19.950] among
[00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:20.130] the
[00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:20.270] most
[00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.570] important
[00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:20.870] in

[00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.930] was
[00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:22.210] indeed
[00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:22.950] telegraphy.
[00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:23.430] So
[00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.590] as
[00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:23.670] you
[00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.810] know,
[00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:24.130] Britain
[00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:24.390] then
[00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.550] as
[00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.750] now
[00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.950] was
[00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:25.150] an
[00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.450] island.
[00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:26.030] It's
[00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.190] still
[00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:26.370] an
[00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:26.630] island.
[00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.930] Back
[00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:27.130] then
[00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:27.230] it
[00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.370] had
[00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:27.810] lots
[00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:27.950] and
[00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:28.130] lots
[00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.290] of
[00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:28.690] colonies.
[00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:29.010] That's
[00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:29.210] what's
[00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:29.530] changed.
[00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.170] It
[00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.370] was
[00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:30.950] a
[00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:31.230] period
[00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.490] of
[00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.770] still
[00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:32.470] rapid
[00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:34.190] acceleration
[00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.710] of
[00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.870] the
[00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:35.170] British
[00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:35.750] colonial
[00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:36.490] adventure.
[00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.270] So
[00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.710] distant
[00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:38.610] outposts
[00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:38.770] or
[00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:38.970] so
[00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:39.230]-called
[00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.790] possessions,
[00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:40.410] territorial
[00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:40.930] possessions,
[00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.810] really
[00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:42.090] all
[00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:42.270] around
[00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.450] the
[00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:42.630] world.
[00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.870] Again,
[00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:43.050] many
[00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:43.150] of
[00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:43.210] you
[00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:43.390] might
[00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.810] recall
[00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:44.010] the
[00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:44.270] old
[00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.590] quip
[00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:45.110] that
[00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:45.290] the
[00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.490] sun
[00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:45.830] never
[00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:46.230] sets
[00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.490] on
[00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.610] the
[00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:46.790] British
[00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:47.230] Empire.
[00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:47.490] In
[00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:47.730] that
[00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:48.030] time
[00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.310] period,
[00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.450] there
[00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:48.690] were
[00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:49.730] colonial
[00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:50.690] holdings
[00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:50.890] or
[00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:51.410] territories
[00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.010] that
[00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.690] spanned
[00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:53.090] really
[00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:53.370] the
[00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:53.730] entire
[00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.170] globe.
[00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:54.450] So
[00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:54.610] at
[00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:54.910] any
[00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:55.170] given
[00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:55.530] time
[00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:55.730] of
[00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.950] day,
[00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:56.150] the
[00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.310] sun
[00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:56.470] was
[00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.710] shining
[00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.850] on
[00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:57.290] some
[00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:58.050] British
[00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:58.630] outpost.
[00:41:59.570 --> 00:41:59.890] So
[00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:00.070] what
[00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:00.150] do
[00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.250] you
[00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:00.470] need
[00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.570] if
[00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:00.650] you're
[00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.670] going
[00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.710] to
[00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.850] try
[00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:00.990] to
[00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.510] administer
[00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:02.250] a
[00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:02.710] world
[00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:03.290]-spanning
[00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.030] empire?
[00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.330] You
[00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:04.590] need
[00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:04.950] ways
[00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:05.230] to
[00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.430] have
[00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.890] efficient
[00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:06.690] communication.
[00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.390] And
[00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.530] that
[00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:07.670] was
[00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.830] an
[00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:08.330] enormous
[00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:09.170] impetus
[00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.390] for
[00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.570] things
[00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:09.730] like
[00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:10.510] telegraphy.
[00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:10.990] Even
[00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.130] with
[00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:11.250] some
[00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:11.310] of
[00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:11.430] the
[00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.910] former
[00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:12.790] colonies,
[00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.170] like
[00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:13.370] the
[00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.510] United
[00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.850] States
[00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:14.070] or
[00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:14.470] Canada,
[00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.170] some
[00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.690] kind
[00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:15.930] of
[00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:16.970] formal
[00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:17.350] colonial
[00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:17.910] holdings,
[00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:18.570] there
[00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:18.710] was
[00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.950] still
[00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:19.090] an
[00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:19.270] effort
[00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.510] in
[00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.650] the
[00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:19.890] same
[00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:20.130] period,
[00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:20.330] the
[00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:20.530] middle
[00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:20.930] decades
[00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:21.050] of
[00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:21.130] the
[00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:21.510] 19th
[00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.870] century,
[00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.430] to
[00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.590] have
[00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:23.110] efficient
[00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:23.450] long
[00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.590]-distance
[00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:24.110] communication
[00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:24.290] for
[00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.430] things
[00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:24.570] like
[00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:24.970] commerce
[00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:25.430] and
[00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.970] diplomacy.
[00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:26.770] So
[00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:26.890] there
[00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:26.990] are
[00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.250] all
[00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:27.530] kinds
[00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.630] of
[00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.890] reasons
[00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:28.210] why
[00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:29.470] electromechanical
[00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.710] investigations
[00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:32.190] were
[00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.350] given
[00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:32.510] a
[00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.730] very
[00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:33.130] high
[00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:33.910] priority
[00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:34.310] in
[00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.550] Britain
[00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.770] in
[00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:34.930] this
[00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:35.170] time
[00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:35.410] period.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:37.200] So
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:37.300] we
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:37.400] get
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:37.520] a
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:37.760] taste
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:37.860] of
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:37.940] it.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.080] Here's
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:38.220] our
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:38.480] first
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:38.920] quotation
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.240] from
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:39.420] that
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:39.780] little
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.820] bit
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.000] of
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.120] the
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:41.460] Maxwell
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:41.620] that
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:41.740] I
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:41.900] just
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:42.220] signed.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.240] Maxwell
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.240] published
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:44.660] this
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:45.840] voluminous
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.180] treatise,
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:46.360] a
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:46.540] two
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:46.780]-volume
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.180] treatise

[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.200] 1873.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:49.340] The
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:49.500] two
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:49.760] volumes
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.040] together
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:50.280] run
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:50.400] to
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:50.660] about
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.280] 900
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:51.740] pages.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:51.980] It
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:52.200] makes
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:52.340] for
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:52.560] fun
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:52.780] beach
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:53.000] reading.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:53.860] But
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:53.960] in
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:54.100] the
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:54.400] very
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:54.680] opening
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:54.820] of
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:54.920] the
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.260] preface,
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:55.400] we
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:55.580] get
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:55.760] this
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.060] really
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:56.420] interesting
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.020] observation.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:57.260] He
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:57.520] tells
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:57.740] us
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:58.220] partly
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:58.580] why
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:42:58.800] anyone
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.000] should
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.220] read
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:42:59.420] this
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:42:59.720] book.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:00.400] And
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:00.500] he
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:00.720] says
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:00.940] here,
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.080] the

[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:02.400] of
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.180] electromagnetism
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:03.440] to

[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:04.980] have
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.360] reacted
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:05.540] on
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:05.840] pure
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.420] science
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:06.880] by
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.080] giving
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:07.280] a
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.760] commercial
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.240] value,
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:08.360] and
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:08.580] indeed
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:08.720] a
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:08.880] kind
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.120] of

[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:14.500] affording
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:14.740] to
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:15.500] electricians,
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:15.640] let's
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:15.780] say
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:16.220] experts
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:16.400] in
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:16.520] the
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:16.820] field,
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:17.560] the
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:17.820] use
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:17.960] of
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.480] apparatus
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:18.720] on
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:18.880] a
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.180] scale
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:19.460] which
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:19.880] greatly
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.340] transcends
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:20.540] that
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:20.720] of
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.020] any

[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:22.560] They're
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:22.780] getting
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.320] huge
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:23.820] investment
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.420] to
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:24.800] conduct
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.380] very
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:25.840] large
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.460] investigations
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:26.740] with

[00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.930] already
[00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:40.110] been
[00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:40.350] very
[00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:40.730] great,
[00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.830] both
[00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:42.010] in
[00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:42.470] stimulating

[00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:48.670] which
[00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.810] is
[00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:49.050] likely
[00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:49.210] to
[00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:49.610] conduce
[00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:49.810] to

[00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.570] scientific
[00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:51.010] progress
[00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:51.330] of
[00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:51.450] the
[00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:51.730] whole
[00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:52.010] engineering
[00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:52.410] profession.
[00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.610] P
[00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:53.270].S.,
[00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.530] buy
[00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:53.690] my
[00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:54.350] 900
[00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:54.610]-page
[00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:54.890] book.
[00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:55.150] It's
[00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.410] literally
[00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:55.690] worth
[00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:55.990] something.
[00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:56.290] That's
[00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:56.410] what
[00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:56.530] he's
[00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:56.830] announcing
[00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:56.970] in
[00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:57.090] the
[00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:57.350] opening
[00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:57.730] pages
[00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:58.630] of
[00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.930] his
[00:43:58.930 --> 00:43:59.670] treatise.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.080] So
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:01.340] let's
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:01.520] go
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:01.800] a
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:01.940] little
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:02.240] bit
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:02.880] into
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.340] some
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:03.980] of
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.180] how
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:04.600] William
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:04.980] Thompson
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:05.320] and
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:05.560] James
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:05.800] Clark
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.260] Maxwell
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:06.940] start
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:07.420] treating
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.060] Faraday's
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:08.240] kind
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:08.340] of
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:08.800] intellectual
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:09.800] legacy.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:10.640] So
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.000] Thompson
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:11.360] began
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:11.700] reading
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.200] Faraday's
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:12.500] books,
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:12.680] as
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:12.800] well
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:12.900] as
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:13.000] some
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:13.320] articles,
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:13.620] as
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:13.800] an
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.320] undergraduate.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.040] Thompson
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.360] was
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:15.720] still,
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.380] you
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:16.460] know,
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:16.820] basically
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.240] 18
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:17.400] and
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:17.680] 19
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:17.960] years
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.180] old
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:18.340] at
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:18.700] Cambridge
[00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:19.810] when
[00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:19.930] he
[00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:20.210] starts
[00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.870] devouring
[00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:21.410] Faraday's
[00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:21.590] work,
[00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.710] or
[00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:22.110] continues
[00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:22.350] to
[00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:22.470] do
[00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.530] so.
[00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.430] He
[00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.690] began
[00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:23.930] to
[00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:24.230] realize
[00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.410] that
[00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.550] he
[00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.730] could
[00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:25.030] put
[00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.510] Faraday's
[00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.710] work,
[00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.830] he
[00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:25.930] could
[00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:26.110] kind
[00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:26.230] of
[00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.830] translate
[00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.130] it
[00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:27.290] on
[00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.390] the
[00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.590] one
[00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:27.950] hand,
[00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:28.590] and
[00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:28.870] also
[00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:29.390] Newton's
[00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.630] work
[00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.810] on
[00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:30.410] mechanics
[00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.090] within
[00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:31.350] the
[00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:31.670] same
[00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:32.130] mathematical
[00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:32.670] structure.
[00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:33.090] This
[00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:33.230] was
[00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.370] the
[00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:33.650] stuff
[00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:33.830] that
[00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:34.070] only
[00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:34.270] in
[00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.550] the
[00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.790] middle
[00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:35.290] decades
[00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:35.910] of
[00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:36.050] the
[00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:36.450] 19th
[00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:36.790] century
[00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:37.350] was
[00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:37.590] what
[00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.190] university
[00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.650] students
[00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:39.010] at
[00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:39.350] Cambridge,
[00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.890] like
[00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:40.310] William
[00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:40.670] Thompson,
[00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:41.350] began
[00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:41.510] to
[00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.650] really
[00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:41.810] be
[00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:42.130] immersed
[00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:42.290] in.
[00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.450] We'll
[00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:42.650] talk
[00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.850] much
[00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:42.970] more
[00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:43.110] about
[00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:43.310] that
[00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:43.610] in
[00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:43.750] the
[00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.970] next
[00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:44.370] lecture.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:45.380] So
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:45.460] he
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:45.760] realized
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:45.900] that
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:46.000] you
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:46.160] could
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:46.440] make
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:46.660] this
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.240] bridge,
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:47.420] you
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:47.560] could
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:47.800] treat
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.160] all
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:48.400] these
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:48.860] disparate
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:49.240] phenomena
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:49.500] within
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.020] electricity,
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.820] and
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.440] separately,
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:51.760] all
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:51.940] these
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:52.320] disparate
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:52.640] phenomena
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:52.920] within
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.280] Newton's
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:53.760] mechanics,
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:54.320] blocks
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:54.620] sliding
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:54.820] down
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.220] planes,
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:55.480] the
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:55.960] attraction
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.140] of
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:56.500] gravity,
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:57.440] introduce
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:57.980] one
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:58.740] similar
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.660] mathematical
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.500] construct,
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:00.900] the
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.360] potential,
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:01.620] a
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.060] scalar
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:02.660] potential,
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:03.520] which
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:03.680] is
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:03.940] often
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:04.120] just
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:04.860] labeled
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.060] by
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:05.220] the
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:05.380] Greek
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:05.620] letter
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.100] phi.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:06.720] If
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:06.860] this
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:06.980] is
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:07.200] brand
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:07.380] new
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:07.480] to
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:07.620] you,
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:07.840] don't
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.100] worry.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:08.400] If
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:08.560] it's
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:08.820] very
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.080] familiar
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:09.280] to
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:09.460] you,
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.080] great.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:11.300] The
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:11.520] idea
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:11.640] is
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:11.720] that
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:11.880] a
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.320] scalar
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:12.840] function,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.080] a
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:13.340] scalar
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:13.800] field
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.080] like
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:14.240] this
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:14.680] potential,
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:15.440] it
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:15.720] has
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.420] values
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:16.700] at
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.000] every
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:17.620] point
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:17.780] in
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:18.160] space,
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:18.400] those
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:18.620] values
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:18.780] can
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.140] change
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:19.300] over
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:19.700] time,
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:20.300] but
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:20.380] it
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:20.560] doesn't
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:20.800] have
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.400] direction.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:21.800] It
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.100] has
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:22.480] no,
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.000] it
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.240] only
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:23.620] has
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.400] magnitudes.
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:24.900] You
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:25.020] can
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:25.180] think
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:25.340] of
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:25.800] making
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.060] a
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:26.240] kind
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:26.500] of
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.120] representing
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:28.420] the
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:28.780] temperature
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.000] in
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:29.120] the
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.440] room
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.100] at
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:30.380] every
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:30.920] location
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.160] in
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:31.440] space,
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.460] and
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:32.660] then
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.260] tracking
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:33.460] how
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:33.680] those
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.020] temperature
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:34.360] readings
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:34.740] change
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:34.920] over
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.280] time
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:35.400] at
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:35.480] each
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:35.740] location
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:35.900] in
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:36.060] space.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:36.520] That's
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:36.700] a
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.100] scalar
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:37.640] function.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.180] Temperature
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:38.380] is
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:38.700] scalar.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:38.840] It
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:38.980] has
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.520] magnitude,
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.100] but
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:40.340] not
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:40.820] direction.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:41.780] That's
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.120] hopefully
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:42.580] review.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:43.460] Other
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:43.820] things
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:44.080] like
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:44.340] these
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.140] fields
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:45.540] that
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:45.960] Faraday
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.100] had
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:46.380] introduced
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:46.640] for
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.000] electricity
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:47.560] magnetism,
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:48.200] those
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:48.540] have
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.200] direction
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:49.520] as
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:49.640] well
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:49.800] as
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.500] magnitude.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:50.740] Those
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:50.860] are
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:51.300] vector
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:51.700] quantities.
[00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.670] Well,
[00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:52.770] as
[00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:53.050] Thompson
[00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:53.250] was
[00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:53.470] learning
[00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.650] to
[00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:53.870] just
[00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:54.490] devour
[00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:54.770] in
[00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.910] his
[00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:55.330] undergraduate
[00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:55.930] studies,
[00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:56.690] you
[00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:56.910] could
[00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:57.350] create
[00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:57.650] a
[00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.990] vector
[00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.490] quantity
[00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.290] by
[00:45:59.290 --> 00:45:59.850] taking
[00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:00.110] kind
[00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:00.190] of
[00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.630] rates
[00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.850] of

[00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:02.430] quantity,
[00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.590] what
[00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:02.750] we'd
[00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.870] now
[00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:03.050] call
[00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.210] the
[00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:03.650] gradient.
[00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:04.510] The

[00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:05.450] of

[00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:50.710] related
[00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.910] to
[00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:51.030] an

[00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:51.970] field,
[00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:52.190] the
[00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.370] state
[00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:52.790] disturbance
[00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.970] of
[00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:53.070] the
[00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:53.290] ether.
[00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.710] Sorry,
[00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:54.150] how'd
[00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.290] that
[00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:54.550] happen?
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:57.740] Sorry,
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.020] gang.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:47:59.000] Okay.
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:00.300] You
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:00.440] can
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:00.640] then
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:00.960] relate
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:01.180] the
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:01.560] electric
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:01.980] field
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:02.260] again
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:02.440] to
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:02.880] rates
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.020] of
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:03.340] change
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:03.460] of
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:03.640] a
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:03.920] simpler

[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:04.600] a
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:04.980] scalar
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:05.500] potential,
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.060] exactly
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:06.660] analogous
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:06.840] to
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:06.980] the
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:07.300] gravitational
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:07.920] case.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:08.640] You
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:08.740] can
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:08.860] then
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.120] ask
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:09.460] how
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:09.840] the
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.360] electric
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:10.780] field
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:11.300] is
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.120] diverging
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:13.320] throughout
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:13.620] space
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:13.740] and
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:13.980] time,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.160] like
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:14.360] those
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:14.700] lines
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:14.880] of
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.100] force
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:15.320] getting
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:15.520] more
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:15.600] and
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:15.700] more
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:15.960] spread
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.160] out
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:16.300] from
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:16.420] each
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:16.600] other

[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:17.440] simple
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:17.800] pictures.
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:18.540] And
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:18.760] that's
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:18.960] related
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.140] to
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:19.360] where
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:19.540] the
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:19.800] stuff
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:19.940] is,
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.060] to
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:20.260] the
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:20.680] sources
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:20.980] of
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.120] this
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:21.520] electrical
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.100] disturbance,
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:22.820] the
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:23.240] charge
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:23.640] density,
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:23.860] how
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.140] many
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:24.840] electrical
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.440] charged
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.260] objects
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:26.700] are
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:27.660] distributed
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:27.940] throughout
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:28.340] space
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:28.540] per
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:28.780] unit
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.160] volume,
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:29.460] say.
[00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:30.250] So
[00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:30.370] he
[00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:30.590] makes
[00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:30.710] a

[00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:31.390] map.
[00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:32.170] And
[00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:32.270] he
[00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.470] says,
[00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:32.610] there's
[00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:32.750] really
[00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.910] this
[00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:33.430] precise
[00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:34.010] mathematical
[00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.550] analogy
[00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:35.150] between
[00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.670] electrical
[00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:36.110] phenomena
[00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:36.550] and
[00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:37.190] mechanics,
[00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.430] like
[00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.790] Newton's
[00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:38.090] laws,
[00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.690] and
[00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.890] the
[00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:39.250] mapping
[00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:39.430] is
[00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.610] done
[00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:39.770] by
[00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.930] this
[00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:40.150] a
[00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.250] little
[00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:40.390] bit
[00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.550] more
[00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:41.030] formal,
[00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.290] more
[00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:41.610] fancy
[00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:41.970] mathematics.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:43.080] So
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:43.340] far,
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:43.660] that's
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:43.900] not
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.280] so
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:44.720] shocking.
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:45.460] Thompson
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:45.640] was
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:45.860] among
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:46.000] the
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:46.220] first
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:46.400] to
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:46.620] take
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.280] this

[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:48.160] side
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:48.380] and
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:48.540] start
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:48.680] doing
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:48.880] new
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:49.060] things
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:49.240] with
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:49.320] it,
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:49.500] with
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:49.680] the

[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.220] stuff.
[00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.510] Within
[00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.990] one
[00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.410] year
[00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:55.170] of
[00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:55.330] when
[00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:55.730] Faraday
[00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:56.030] introduced
[00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.170] what
[00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:56.270] we
[00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.450] now
[00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.650] call
[00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:57.090] Faraday
[00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:57.590] rotation,
[00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.810] remember
[00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:57.950] that
[00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:58.110] thing
[00:48:58.110 --> 00:48:58.350] about
[00:48:58.350 --> 00:48:58.670] the

[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.280] Thompson
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:03.580] does
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:03.780] the
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:04.040] same
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:04.380] thing.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:04.480] He
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:04.580] says,
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:04.820] oh
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:05.140] good,
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:05.660] Faraday
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:05.800] has
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:05.920] some

[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:06.260] cool
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:06.500] stuff.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:06.720] Let
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:06.840] me
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:07.080] put

[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:11.320] So
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:11.620] now
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.000] he's
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:12.180] still
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:12.320] an

[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:13.580] Thompson
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:13.800] is

[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:15.860] not
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:16.040] just
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:16.560] rewriting

[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.160] Faraday
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:23.640] rotation.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:24.520] He
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:24.880] introduces
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:25.200] a
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:25.500] new
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:25.820] kind
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:25.940] of
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:26.300] mathematical
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:26.940] object,
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:27.220] the
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:27.620] vector
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:28.160] potential.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:28.420] That
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:28.560] was
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:28.900] not
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:29.240] known
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:29.500] even
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:29.640] to
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:29.780] the
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:30.000] French
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.320] savant.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:31.180] We
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:31.400] still
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:31.680] call
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:31.780] it
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:31.900] the
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:32.100] vector
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:32.500] potential
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:32.940] A.
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:33.780] And
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:33.880] he
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.140] introduces
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:34.400] a
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:34.700] new
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.220] operator,
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:35.360] a
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:35.440] new
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:35.640] way
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:35.780] of
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.580] manipulating
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.040] that
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:37.440] quantity,
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:37.700] which
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:37.800] we
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.040] call
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:38.220] the
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:38.480] curl.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.020] Thompson
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:39.340] invents
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:39.700] curl
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.280] as
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:40.400] an
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:40.820] undergraduate.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:41.120] Just
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:41.320] let
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:41.560] that
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:41.880] sink
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.000] in
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.120] for
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:42.160] a
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:42.260] second.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:43.600] So,
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:43.820] you
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:43.960] know,
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:44.620] the
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:44.760] new
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.020] semester
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:45.120] is
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:45.360] early.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:45.540] You
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:45.700] all
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:45.820] can
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:45.980] invent
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.220] all
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:46.380] kinds
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:46.460] of
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:46.560] new
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:46.780] math
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:47.080] before,
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:47.320] let's
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:47.560] say,
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.040] November.
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:48.700] Thompson
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:48.820] is
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:49.000] literally
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:49.180] doing
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:49.320] this
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:49.520] like
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:49.740] for
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.100] fun
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:50.360] on
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:50.480] the
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:50.780] weekends
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:50.960] because
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:51.060] he
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:51.240] can't
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:51.320] get
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:51.480] enough
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:51.800] math.
[00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:53.570] So
[00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:53.690] he
[00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.970] introduces
[00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:54.150] a
[00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.330] vector
[00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:54.650] potential
[00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:54.830] and
[00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:55.010] this
[00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.370] curl
[00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.810] because
[00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:56.150] as
[00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.550] Faraday
[00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:56.710] had
[00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.870] kind
[00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.970] of
[00:49:56.970 --> 00:49:57.430] intuited,
[00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.350] the
[00:49:58.350 --> 00:49:58.750] effect
[00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.930] of
[00:49:58.930 --> 00:49:59.050] a
[00:49:59.050 --> 00:49:59.390] magnetic
[00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.810] field
[00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:00.130] on
[00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:00.390] the
[00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:01.030] surrounding
[00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.650] aether
[00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:02.110] was
[00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:02.230] this
[00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.350] kind
[00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:02.470] of
[00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.910] turning
[00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:03.190] or
[00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.850] twisting
[00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:04.830] strain,
[00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:05.210] unlike
[00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:05.350] the
[00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:05.490] kind
[00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:05.610] of
[00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:05.950] straight
[00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:06.190] line
[00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.630] strain
[00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:07.410] of
[00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:07.510] an
[00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.770] electric
[00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:08.090] field.
[00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:08.270] And
[00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.470] so
[00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:09.050] Thompson
[00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:09.270] wanted
[00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.450] to
[00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:09.630] kind
[00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.770] of
[00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:10.530] formalize
[00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:10.710] what
[00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:11.010] that
[00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:11.670] curl,
[00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:12.050] what
[00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:12.230] that
[00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:13.010] twisting
[00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.530] torsion
[00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:13.650] would
[00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:13.750] be
[00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:14.030] like
[00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.550] as
[00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:14.730] a
[00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:15.270] different
[00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.510] kind
[00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.610] of
[00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:15.910] strain
[00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:16.050] in
[00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:16.170] the
[00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:16.410] aether.
[00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.550] And
[00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:16.670] he
[00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:17.270] formalizes
[00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.470] this
[00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.770] new
[00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:18.210] operator,
[00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:18.430] which
[00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:18.530] we
[00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:18.830] now
[00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:19.390] know
[00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.550] and
[00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:19.710] love
[00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.830] and
[00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:20.070] use
[00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:20.490] every
[00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:20.770] single
[00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:21.130] day.
[00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.770] It
[00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:21.970] comes
[00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:22.130] out
[00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.290] of
[00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:22.670] Thompson
[00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:23.010] trying
[00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:23.430] to
[00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.830] treat
[00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:24.650] mathematically,
[00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:25.290] formally,
[00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.830] what
[00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:25.910] he
[00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:26.030] was
[00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.230] still
[00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.510] learning
[00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.770] very
[00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:27.170] actively
[00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.450] from
[00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:27.690] people
[00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:27.930] like
[00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:28.350] Faraday.
[00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:28.910] Pretty
[00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:29.670] amazing.
[00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.450] So
[00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:32.470] following
[00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:33.150] Faraday's
[00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.470] lead,
[00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:34.170] Thompson
[00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:34.650] begins
[00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:34.830] to
[00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:35.230] interpret
[00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.510] this
[00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:36.570] mathematical
[00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:37.110] result
[00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.170] mechanically.
[00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:38.490] Remember,
[00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:38.630] we
[00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.770] saw
[00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:38.950] that
[00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:39.230] one
[00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.330]-to
[00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:39.490]-one
[00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:39.930] bridge
[00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:40.190] between
[00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.530] Newton
[00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:41.090] mechanics
[00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:41.630] stuff
[00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.790] and
[00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:41.910] the
[00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:42.310] electricity
[00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:42.790] stuff.
[00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:43.470] He
[00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:43.590] says
[00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:43.730] if
[00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:43.850] the
[00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:44.070] same
[00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:44.630] mathematics
[00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:45.110] applies,
[00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.390] maybe
[00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.550] it's
[00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:45.670] the
[00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.910] same
[00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:46.650] physical
[00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:47.330] explanation
[00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:48.810] undergirding
[00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:49.090] all
[00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:49.210] of
[00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:49.370] it.
[00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:50.310] The
[00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:50.690] aether,
[00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:51.090] he
[00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:51.770] learned
[00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:52.030] from
[00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.250] people
[00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.450] like
[00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:52.750] Michael
[00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:53.150] Faraday
[00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.250] and
[00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:53.450] others,
[00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:53.950] the
[00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:54.110] aether
[00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:54.370] seemed
[00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:54.450] to
[00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:54.490] be
[00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:54.650] this
[00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:55.310] elastic
[00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:55.990] physical
[00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.450] medium.
[00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.750] It
[00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.990] was
[00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.250] literally
[00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:57.710] a
[00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:58.270] kind
[00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.430] of
[00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.930] stuff
[00:50:58.930 --> 00:50:59.610] spread
[00:50:59.610 --> 00:50:59.710] out
[00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:00.030] everywhere.
[00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:00.730] And
[00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:00.910] that
[00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:01.210] medium
[00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:01.390] could
[00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.530] be
[00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:01.770] put
[00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:01.990] under
[00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.550] local
[00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:03.030] states
[00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.510] of
[00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.850] tension
[00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:04.030] or
[00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.470] strain
[00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.710] with
[00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:05.090] twist,
[00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:05.310] with
[00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:05.770] directional
[00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:06.410] properties
[00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.090] described
[00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:07.330] by
[00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:07.490] these
[00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.890] vectors.
[00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:08.850] So
[00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:08.990] these
[00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.130] new
[00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:09.530] mathematical
[00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.990] techniques
[00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.230] like
[00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.510] curl
[00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.830] could
[00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:11.710] quantify
[00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:12.370] this
[00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:12.910] physical
[00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:13.470] mechanical
[00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:14.110] medium's
[00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:14.570] response
[00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:15.130] to
[00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:15.510] pressures
[00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.770] like
[00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:16.110] electric
[00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:16.250] and
[00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:16.510] magnetic
[00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:17.090] fields.
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:18.380] He
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:18.600] really
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:18.760] took
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:18.880] that
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.000] to
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:19.220] heart
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:19.460] in
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:19.720] a
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.020] famous
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:20.160] set
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:20.260] of
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:20.540] public
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:20.880] lectures,
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:21.160] much
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:21.360] like
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:21.560] these
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:21.880] London
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.180] ones.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:22.340] He
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:22.600] actually
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:22.860] came
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:23.020] to
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:23.420] Baltimore
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:23.640] in
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:23.720] the
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:23.880] United
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.140] States
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:24.780] and
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:24.960] gave
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.360] very,
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:25.640] very
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:25.920] well
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:26.320] attended
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:26.760] popular
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.200] lectures
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:27.740] for
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:28.160] in
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:28.460] Baltimore.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:29.620] Thompson
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:29.960] basically
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:30.200] tried
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:30.300] to
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:30.420] give
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:30.520] his
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:30.760] audience
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:30.980] a
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:31.300] feel
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:31.520] for
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:31.740] what
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:31.980] these
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:32.160] kind
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:32.260] of
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:32.600] experts
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:32.840] were
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.180] doing.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:33.820] This
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:33.980] is
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:34.560] direct
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.200] quotations
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:35.400] of,
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:35.760] again,
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:36.060] people
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:36.180] in
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:36.300] their
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:36.640] fancy
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:36.980] opera
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:37.340] gloves,
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:37.620] like
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:37.800] out
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:37.900] for
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:37.960] a
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:38.060] night
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:38.140] on
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:38.240] the
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:38.540] town,
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:39.160] do
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:39.300] the
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:39.560] great
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:39.880] Lord
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:40.260] Kelvin
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:40.460] by
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:40.600] this
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:40.780] point,
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:40.940] the
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:41.240] great
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.100] ennobled
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.560] Lord
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:43.880] Kelvin
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:44.560] described
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:44.780] about
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:44.960] the
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.220] latest
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:45.580] advances.
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:46.220] And
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:46.300] he
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:46.560] tells
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:46.700] this
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:46.960] fancy
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.160] audience,
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:47.560] stick
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:47.740] your
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:47.980] hand
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:48.080] in
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:48.220] a
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:48.380] bowl
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:48.620] of
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:48.980] jelly,
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:49.660] okay,
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:50.460] and
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:50.620] see
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:50.780] how
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:50.980] it
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:51.220] wiggles
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:51.480] and
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:51.900] vibrates
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:52.080] as
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:52.180] you
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:52.340] move
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:52.460] your
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:52.620] hand
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:52.780] around.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:53.300] That's
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:53.560] what
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:53.700] it
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:53.980] was
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:54.140] to
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:54.280] do
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:54.700] physics.
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:55.420] Because
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:55.840] the
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.140] jelly
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:56.320] is
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:56.460] just
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:56.620] like
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:56.740] this
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:57.220] elastic
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:57.680] aether.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.320] It's
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:58.780] everywhere.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:51:59.540] And
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:51:59.660] the
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:51:59.940] job
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:00.080] of
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:00.500] super
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:00.860] smart,
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:01.180] ambitious
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:01.540] people
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:01.860] like
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:02.260] William
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:02.620] Thompson
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.240] was
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:03.440] to
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.000] quantify
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:04.440] the
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:04.760] wiggles
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.020] and
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:05.480] vibrations
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:05.720] of
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:05.860] that
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:06.160] ether
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:06.700] much
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:06.840] as
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:06.960] you
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:07.180] would
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:07.400] if
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:07.520] you
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.060] disturbed
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:08.320] this.
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:10.080] I
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:10.580] love
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:10.780] that.
[00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:12.190] This
[00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.370] becomes
[00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:12.570] known
[00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:12.730] as
[00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:12.830] a
[00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:13.370] mechanical
[00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:14.170] worldview.
[00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:14.910] If
[00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:15.050] the
[00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:15.550] mathematics
[00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:15.830] was
[00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:15.950] the

[00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:18.550] map,
[00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:19.310] then
[00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:19.510] maybe
[00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.670] you
[00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.810] could
[00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:20.150] model
[00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:21.270] electromagnetism
[00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.510] on
[00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.910] literally
[00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:22.070] a
[00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:22.610] mechanical
[00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:22.990] model.
[00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:23.130] You
[00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:23.250] have
[00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:23.330] an
[00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:23.770] elastic
[00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:24.170] stuff
[00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.510] under
[00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.950] states
[00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:25.130] of
[00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.450] strain

[00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:26.090] directional
[00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:26.670] properties.
[00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.790] And
[00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:27.910] if
[00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:28.090] the
[00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:28.410] models
[00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:28.770] reproduce

[00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.750] relevant
[00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:30.250] phenomena
[00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:30.710] like
[00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:31.310] Coulomb's
[00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:31.530] law
[00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:31.710] and
[00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.850] all
[00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:31.970] the
[00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:32.270] rest,
[00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.470] all
[00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.590] the
[00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:33.090] electromagnetic
[00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:34.430] phenomenon,
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:35.220] then
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:35.400] maybe
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:35.620] these
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:35.980] aren't
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:36.380] only
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.120] analogies
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:37.320] or
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:37.740] models.
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:38.360] Maybe
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:38.720] ether
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.140] really
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:39.500] was
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.080] merely
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:40.460] a
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:40.840] mechanical
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:41.340] system,
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:41.660] just
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:41.980] like
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.260] that

[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:42.980] of
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:43.320] jam.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.020] So
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:44.100] it
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:44.320] becomes
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:44.460] a
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.020] mechanical
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:45.600] worldview.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:46.180] All
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:46.360] of
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:46.520] the
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.060] things
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:47.200] of

[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.260] are
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:48.360] to
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:48.460] be
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:48.760] understood
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.080] on
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:49.740] mechanical

[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:50.120] of

[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.080] of

[00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:54.970] Last
[00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:55.190] part,
[00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.330] then
[00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:55.430] I'll
[00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.610] pause
[00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:55.690] for
[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.810] more
[00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:56.110] questions.
[00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.390] We're
[00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.530] almost
[00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:56.810] done.
[00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:58.130] We're
[00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.190] going
[00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.250] to
[00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.430] turn
[00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.750] to
[00:52:58.750 --> 00:52:59.710] Thompson's
[00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:00.350] slightly
[00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:00.790] younger

[00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:02.110] Clark
[00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:02.430] Maxwell.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:05.500] I
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:05.840] mentioned
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:06.800] they
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:06.960] had
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.100] a
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:07.340] similar
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:07.680] upbringing
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:07.860] a
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.000] couple
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.160] years
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:08.480] apart,
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.180] both
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:09.600] Scottish,
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:09.860] both
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:10.020] come
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:10.160] to
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:10.360] Cambridge
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:10.540] for
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:10.700] their
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:11.040] undergraduate
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:11.540] studies.
[00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:12.670] Maxwell
[00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.770] was
[00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:12.890] a

[00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.210] years
[00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:13.410] younger.
[00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.530] I
[00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:13.610] don't
[00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:13.750] think
[00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.850] they
[00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:14.030] actually
[00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.490] overlapped
[00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:14.630] in
[00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.790] Cambridge.
[00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:14.950] They
[00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:15.110] came
[00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:15.190] to
[00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.290] know
[00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:15.410] each
[00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:15.510] other

[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:17.820] Maxwell,
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.140] like
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:18.420] Thompson,
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:18.740] becomes
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:19.100] steeped
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:19.160] in

[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:21.160] We'll
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:21.400] talk
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:21.600] a
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:21.780] lot
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:21.920] more
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:22.100] about

[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:23.600] class.
[00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:24.870] And
[00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:25.750] Maxwell
[00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:26.050] develops
[00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:26.570] further
[00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:27.130] analogies
[00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:27.590] between

[00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:31.110] systems.
[00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:31.370] Here's
[00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.490] a
[00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:31.710] famous

[00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:32.130] And
[00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:32.270] this,

[00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:32.990] you
[00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.130] get
[00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:33.450] some

[00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.170] description
[00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:34.330] of

[00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:34.850] that
[00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:35.250] chapter

[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:38.820] So
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:38.940] to
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:39.220] model
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:39.380] the
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:39.660] effects
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:39.780] of
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:39.900] a
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.260] magnetic
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:40.580] field
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:40.720] on

[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:42.360] imagines
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:42.500] this
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:43.000] elaborate
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:43.540] system.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:43.960] Basically,
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:44.520] it's
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:44.660] like
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:44.820] a
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:45.340] contraption

[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:48.200] gears.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:48.660] We
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:48.760] don't
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:48.860] have
[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:48.880] to
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:48.960] worry
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.060] about
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:49.160] the
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:49.500] details
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:49.660] so
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:49.980] much.
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:50.540] The
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.000] ambition
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:51.180] is
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:51.300] what
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:51.400] I
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:51.560] want
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:51.680] to
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.100] convey,
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:52.800] that
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:52.940] there's
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:53.120] a
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:53.520] physical
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:53.920] model
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.160] of

[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:57.200] levers,
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:57.440] and
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:57.940] straps
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:58.800] that
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:58.920] he
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.180] thinks
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:53:59.380] is
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:53:59.800] what's
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.480] really
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:00.780] going
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.120] on
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:01.240] in
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:01.360] the

[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.200] when
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:02.280] we
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:02.380] do
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:02.620] things
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:02.840] like
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.080] put
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:03.320] a
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:03.520] little

[00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.930] So
[00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:08.370] between

[00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.190] but
[00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.350] can
[00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:13.630] change
[00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.790] the

[00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:16.030] It
[00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:16.190] really
[00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.310] is
[00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:16.430] like
[00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.590] these

[00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:23.910] you
[00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:24.030] could
[00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.290] change
[00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.410] it
[00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:24.570] by

[00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.350] You
[00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:28.630] change

[00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:31.850] changes
[00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:32.010] the

[00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:35.030] be
[00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:36.370] behaving.
[00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.930] It's
[00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:37.150] all
[00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.390] this
[00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.910] Faraday

[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.220] So
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:43.540] this
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:43.820] unit
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:44.100] cell

[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:45.880] That
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:46.220] changes
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:46.520] speed
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:46.620] at

[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:47.000] these
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:47.760] intervening,
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:47.920] these

[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:48.160]-called
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:48.520] idle
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:48.880] wheels
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.280] spin.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.280] That
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:50.520] then
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:50.840] changes
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:50.940] the

[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:52.740] spin
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:52.900] because
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.040] they're
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:53.300] literally
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:53.800] connected.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.080] So
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:54.200] it's
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:54.320] all

[00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.870] So
[00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:56.270] all
[00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.590] effects
[00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:56.750] are

[00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.930] is
[00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:02.090] by
[00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:02.310] these

[00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:09.050] And
[00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:09.210] again,
[00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.490] he

[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.160] Well,
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:51.300] this
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:51.540] didn't
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:51.860] impress
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:52.260] everyone.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:52.420] I

[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:53.640] This

[00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:57.960] Here's
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.040] a
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:58.160] review
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:58.320] by
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:58.500] the

[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:00.180] Pierre
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:00.580] Duhaime,
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:01.880] reviewing
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.900] Oliver
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:03.380] Lodge's
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:03.560] book,
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:03.700] this
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:03.820] kind
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:03.920] of
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.680] Maxwellian
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:05.500] book.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:06.380] Duhaime
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:06.680] hoped
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:06.800] he
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:06.900] would
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:07.120] like
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:07.220] it.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:07.320] He
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:07.580] also
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:07.920] was
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.100] very
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:08.300] interested
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:08.400] in
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.000] electromagnetism,
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:09.180] but
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:09.360] he
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:09.740] just
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:10.300] snips
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:10.500] in
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:10.640] this
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:11.140] wonderful
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:11.700] sneering
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:12.120] French
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:12.460] way.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:12.840] It's
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:12.980] worth
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:13.380] quoting.
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:14.480] Duhaime
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:14.820] says,
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:15.140] here
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:15.440] is
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:15.560] a
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:15.720] book
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.060] intended
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:16.240] to
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:16.780] expound
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:17.000] the
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:17.400] modern
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:17.720] theories
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:17.860] of
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:18.320] electricity.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:19.080] In
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:19.180] it,
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:19.280] there
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:19.460] are
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:19.700] nothing
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:19.960] but
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.420] strings
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:20.660] which
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:20.880] move
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.080] around
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:21.680] pulleys,
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.160] which
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:22.380] roll
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:22.620] around
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:23.040] drums,
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:23.300] which
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:23.460] go
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:23.640] through
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.000] pearl
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:24.460] beads,
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:24.680] which
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:24.960] carry
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.400] weights,
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:26.160] and
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:26.420] tubes
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:26.640] which
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:26.900] pump
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:27.260] water
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:27.440] while
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:27.720] others
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.020] swell
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:28.160] and
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:28.640] contract.
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:29.600] Toothed
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:29.800] wheels
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.020] are
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:30.220] geared
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:30.380] to
[00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:30.440] one
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:30.600] another
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:30.760] and
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:30.980] gauge
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:31.280] hooks.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:31.820] This
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:31.920] is
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.040] the
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:32.200] real
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:32.480] kicker.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:33.080] We
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:33.340] thought
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:33.480] we
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:33.580] were
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:33.920] entering
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.080] the
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:34.520] tranquil
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:34.860] and
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.200] neatly
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:35.740] ordered
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:36.260] abode
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:36.440] of
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:36.980] reason,
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:37.640] but
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:37.760] we
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.020] find
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:38.360] ourselves
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:38.600] in
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:38.780] a
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:39.200] factory.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:39.680] This
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:39.900] was
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:40.160] not
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:40.440] high
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:40.860] praise.
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:41.020] He
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:41.120] was
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:41.280] like,
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:41.540] I
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:41.720] thought
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:41.780] I
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:41.820] was
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:41.920] going
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:41.940] to
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:42.100] learn
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:42.580] something
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:43.100] edifying
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:43.300] for
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:43.500] my
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:43.860] soul.
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:44.660] Instead,
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:44.860] this
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:44.980] is
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:45.480] literally
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:46.060] low
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:46.500] class
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:46.840] stuff.
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:47.060] This
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:47.160] is
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:47.320] the
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:47.700] most
[00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.690] obnoxious
[00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:50.170] takedown
[00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:50.390] book
[00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.550] review
[00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:50.690] that
[00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.810] I
[00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:50.950] could
[00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:51.150] think
[00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:51.350] of.
[00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.930] So
[00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:52.350] this
[00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:53.070] Maxwellian
[00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:53.350] British
[00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:53.750] approach
[00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:54.150] doesn't
[00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.510] please
[00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:55.070] everyone.
[00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.630] And
[00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.850] yet,
[00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:56.030] as
[00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:56.150] we'll
[00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.330] see
[00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:56.430] in
[00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.510] the
[00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.770] last
[00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:57.010] little
[00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:57.310] bit,
[00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:57.730] they're
[00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:57.890] starting

[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:01.260] Last
[00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:01.440] little

[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:01.780] then
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:01.940] we'll
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:02.160] pause

[00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.410] So
[00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:06.570] while

[00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:07.110] out

[00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.830] Maxwell
[00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:15.250] starts
[00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:15.950] putting

[00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:21.210] These

[00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:36.750] They're

[00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:40.030] And
[00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:40.230] that's
[00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.370] what

[00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:41.090] were

[00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.710] Then
[00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:43.830] he
[00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:44.010] goes

[00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:45.750] to

[00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:53.070] And
[00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:53.190] he
[00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.590] finds,

[00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:54.970] didn't

[00:58:59.370 --> 00:58:59.950] would

[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:03.520] Here's

[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:01.200] I'll
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:01.480] pause,

[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:03.800] I
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:03.880] want
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:03.940] to

[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:06.540] then

[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:31.760] might
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:31.920] not
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.040] get,
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:32.120] I
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:32.380] think
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:32.500] I'll
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:32.640] get,
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:32.940] won't
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:33.040] get
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:33.120] to
[01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:33.220] them
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:33.440] all
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:33.800] today.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:43.980] Great,
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:44.180] great
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:44.380] question.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:44.620] Thank
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:44.680] you.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:44.800] So,
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:44.900] you're
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:44.980] right.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.060] So,
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:45.200] there
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:45.380] was
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:45.540] a
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:45.780] spectrum,
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:46.060] even
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:46.360] among
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:46.840] what
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:46.940] we
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:47.100] now
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.260] call
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:47.360] the
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:47.860] Maxwellians.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.000] They
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:48.160] didn't
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:48.340] all
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:48.640] have,
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:48.960] you
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.040] know,
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:49.480] exactly
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:49.620] the
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:49.680] same
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:49.940] ideas,
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.040] or
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:50.140] they
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:50.420] shared
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:50.600] a
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:50.800] lot.
[01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.570] And
[01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:51.690] so,
[01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.910] indeed,
[01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:52.170] some
[01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:52.250] of
[01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:52.350] them
[01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:52.690] wondered,
[01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:52.950] is
[01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:53.170] this
[01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:53.630] a
[01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.990] useful
[01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.450] analogy?
[01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.710] And
[01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.830] if
[01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:55.030] so,
[01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:55.170] should
[01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:55.270] we
[01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.510] nonetheless
[01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.830] keep
[01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:56.170] pursuing
[01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:56.370] it,
[01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:56.490] see
[01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:56.570] what
[01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:56.670] we
[01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.770] get
[01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:56.950] out
[01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:57.030] of
[01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:57.190] it?
[01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.930] Others
[01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:58.090] were
[01:02:58.090 --> 01:02:58.470] convinced
[01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.690] that
[01:02:58.690 --> 01:02:58.930] it's
[01:02:58.930 --> 01:02:59.210] more
[01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.370] than,
[01:02:59.470 --> 01:02:59.590] it's
[01:02:59.590 --> 01:02:59.790] not
[01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:00.230] merely
[01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.410] an
[01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:00.790] analogy.
[01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:01.370] It's
[01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:01.470] a
[01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.670] helpful
[01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:02.030] analogy,
[01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.550] precisely
[01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:02.890] because
[01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:03.010] of
[01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:03.230] some
[01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.630] deeper
[01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:04.170] similarity.
[01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:04.850] And
[01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:05.530] individual
[01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:05.770] views
[01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:06.210] changed
[01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:06.390] over
[01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.730] time,
[01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.850] and
[01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:06.950] the
[01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:07.110] whole
[01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:07.450] group
[01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:07.830] would
[01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:07.990] have
[01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.090] a
[01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:08.250] kind
[01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:08.690] of,
[01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:09.090] let's
[01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:09.210] say,
[01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.630] evolving
[01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:10.030] center
[01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:10.190] of
[01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.530] gravity.
[01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:11.110] They
[01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:11.230] were
[01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.570] more
[01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:11.890] like
[01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:12.090] each
[01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:12.490] other
[01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:12.990] in
[01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:13.130] the
[01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.290] kind
[01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:13.390] of
[01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.750] Cambridge
[01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:14.270] scene,
[01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.890] than
[01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:15.170] like,
[01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:15.510] say,
[01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:15.850] the
[01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:16.170] French,
[01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.390] or
[01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.550] the
[01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:16.830] Germans,
[01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:17.130] or
[01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:17.390] indeed
[01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.850] communities
[01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:18.110] further
[01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:18.590] afield,
[01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:18.770] as
[01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:19.050] we'll
[01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:19.290] look
[01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:19.470] at.
[01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:20.210] So,
[01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:20.630] I
[01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.770] don't
[01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:20.910] want
[01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.950] to
[01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:21.090] make
[01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:21.170] it
[01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:21.270] sound
[01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.390] like
[01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:21.490] they
[01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:21.590] were
[01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:21.890] all
[01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:22.130] kind
[01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:22.210] of
[01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:22.410] like,
[01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:23.070] exactly
[01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:23.290] had
[01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:23.410] the
[01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:23.630] same
[01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.990] notion.
[01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:24.590] They
[01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:24.730] were
[01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:25.030] pretty
[01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:25.550] similar,
[01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:26.270] compared
[01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:26.770] to,
[01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.650] as
[01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:27.770] we'll
[01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.870] see,
[01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:28.050] actually,
[01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:28.150] we'll
[01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.250] see
[01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.350] a
[01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:28.510] really
[01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.750] interesting
[01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:29.350] contrast
[01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:30.090] next
[01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:30.430] class,
[01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.610] I
[01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:30.750] think,
[01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:31.010] interesting,
[01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:31.710] with
[01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.970] some
[01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:32.230] leading
[01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.590] scholars
[01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:32.890] within
[01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:33.130] the
[01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:33.330] German
[01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:33.790] states.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:34.600] So,
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:35.120] there,
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:35.340] there
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:35.460] was
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:35.660] maybe
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:35.840] the
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.260] strongest
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:36.860] contrast.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:37.600] But
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:37.720] you're
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:37.860] right,
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.000] that
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:38.240] some
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:38.340] of
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:38.460] these,
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:38.740] even
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:39.000] within
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.360] Cambridge,
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:39.500] or
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:39.600] the
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:39.840] kind
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:39.940] of
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:40.280] close
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:40.960] Maxwellian
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.820] colleagues,
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:42.340] they
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:42.460] were
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:42.740] all
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:43.040] delighted
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:43.260] to
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:43.500] pursue
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:43.660] the
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:44.140] mathematical
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:44.700] analogies.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:44.800] They
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:44.880] were
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.080] getting
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:45.540] trained
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:46.000] in
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.160] this
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:46.540] very,
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:46.700] very
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:47.720] elaborate
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.260] mathematical
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:48.760] machinery,
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.020] as
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:49.180] we'll
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:49.380] talk
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:49.520] more
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:49.680] about
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:49.900] next
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:50.100] time.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:50.420] They
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:50.740] shared
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:51.080] that.
[01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:52.130] And
[01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:52.230] they
[01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.350] were
[01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:52.710] impressed
[01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.970] by
[01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:53.210] what
[01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.370] the
[01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:53.950] analogies
[01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:54.150] would
[01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.330] bring
[01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:54.470] them,
[01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:54.770] either
[01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:55.010] to
[01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.750] explain
[01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:56.130] something,
[01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.450] or
[01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:56.610] to
[01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:57.010] prompt
[01:03:57.010 --> 01:03:57.270] new
[01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.690] questions
[01:03:57.690 --> 01:03:57.810] to
[01:03:57.810 --> 01:03:57.930] then
[01:03:57.930 --> 01:03:58.110] try
[01:03:58.110 --> 01:03:58.210] to
[01:03:58.210 --> 01:03:58.330] go
[01:03:58.330 --> 01:03:58.650] investigate
[01:03:58.650 --> 01:03:58.830] the
[01:03:58.830 --> 01:03:59.050] laboratory.
[01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.190] It
[01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.270] was
[01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.410] a
[01:03:59.410 --> 01:03:59.830] productive
[01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:00.070] set
[01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:00.150] of
[01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.750] analogies.
[01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:01.650] That
[01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:01.810] was
[01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:02.190] already
[01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.370] what
[01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:02.510] they
[01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.850] agreed
[01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:03.110] on.
[01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:03.770] Some
[01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.950] then
[01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:04.250] said,
[01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:04.510] it's
[01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.730] not
[01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.870] just
[01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:05.250] analogy,
[01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:05.710] the
[01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.930] world
[01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:06.070] is
[01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:06.210] filled
[01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:06.390] with
[01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.690] jelly,
[01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:07.430] effectively.
[01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:08.230] It's
[01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.290] a
[01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:08.430] great
[01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.750] question.
[01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:09.890] It
[01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:10.070] looks
[01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:10.290] like
[01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:10.610] Julia
[01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:10.850] has
[01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:11.010] very
[01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:11.290] kindly
[01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:11.870] compiled
[01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:12.250] a
[01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:12.490] bunch
[01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:12.810] of
[01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:14.050] questions
[01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:14.190] for
[01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.250] me.
[01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:14.350] Let
[01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:14.430] me
[01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:14.750] answer
[01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.210] some
[01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:15.390] that
[01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.630] Julia
[01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:15.870] has
[01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:17.010] private
[01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:17.310] chatted
[01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:17.430] to
[01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.550] me.
[01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:17.630] And
[01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.850] if
[01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:18.310] I
[01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:18.490] miss
[01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:18.650] some
[01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.870] others,
[01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.610] we
[01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:19.750] have
[01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.910] time
[01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.990] for
[01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.070] some
[01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:20.190] more.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.160] So
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:21.520] someone
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:21.940] asks,
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:22.160] by
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:22.320] the
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:22.320] way,
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:22.500] Julia,
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.020] if
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:23.480] university
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:23.620] and
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:23.860] research
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.300] institutions
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:24.480] were
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:24.960] separated
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.120] in
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:25.400] time,
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:25.580] who
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:25.720] used
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:25.860] to
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:26.160] teach
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:26.280] at
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:26.340] the
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:26.620] universities?
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:26.880] Oh,
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.140] very
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:27.360] good.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:28.540] People
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:28.980] would
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:29.240] teach
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:29.440] at
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:29.540] the
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:29.780] universities
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:30.000] who
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:30.140] had
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:30.360] gone
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:30.480] to
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:30.880] universities.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:31.120] So
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:31.220] it
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:31.320] was
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:31.720] self
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.360]-replicating.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:32.580] Now,
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.160] that's
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:33.320] still
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:33.580] true
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:34.020] today.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:34.480] But
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:34.700] we've,
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:35.100] we've
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:35.440] achieved
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:35.600] a
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:35.840] kind
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.020] of
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:36.760] monopoly,
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:37.360] whereas
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:37.620] back
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:37.800] then
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:37.880] it
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.080] wasn't
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:38.280] such
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:38.340] a
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:38.700] monopoly.
[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:39.700] That
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:39.820] is
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:39.920] to
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.040] say,
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:40.400] people
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:40.620] who
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:40.850] would
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:41.940] teach
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:42.060] at
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:42.500] universities
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:42.820] had
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:43.140] indeed
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:43.380] been
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:43.640] trained
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.080] like,
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:44.620] like
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:45.480] William
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:45.800] Thompson
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.000] or
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:46.160] James
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:46.340] Clark
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:46.660] Maxwell,
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:46.780] were
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:46.880] their
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.060] own
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:47.460] students.
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:48.600] And
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:48.800] in
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:48.920] fact,
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.040] we'll
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:49.300] talk
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:49.560] quite
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:49.660] a
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:49.740] bit
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:49.900] about
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:50.100] this
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:50.200] in
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:50.300] the
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:50.560] next
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.260] class
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:51.400] and
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:51.620] something
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:52.240] that
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:52.460] I
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:52.620] find
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:52.780] really
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:53.020] interesting.
[01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:54.190] And
[01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.350] that
[01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:54.490] was
[01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:54.750] still
[01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:55.470] separated
[01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.810] from
[01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:56.070] people
[01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:56.230] who
[01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.410] could
[01:04:56.410 --> 01:04:56.770] enter
[01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:57.310] really
[01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:58.130] elaborately,
[01:04:58.310 --> 01:04:58.790] amazingly
[01:04:58.790 --> 01:04:59.290] prestigious
[01:04:59.290 --> 01:04:59.710] careers
[01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:00.110] like
[01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:00.450] Michael
[01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:00.910] Faraday,
[01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:01.030] or
[01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:01.190] even
[01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.590] Thomas
[01:05:01.590 --> 01:05:01.770] Young
[01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:02.070] before
[01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:02.310] him,
[01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:02.770] or
[01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:03.010] Hans
[01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:03.270] Christian
[01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.610] Oersted,
[01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:03.770] or
[01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.950] many
[01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:04.310] other
[01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:04.570] names
[01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:04.650] we
[01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:04.890] encounter
[01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:05.250] today,
[01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:06.150] without
[01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.490] going
[01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:06.670] through
[01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.850] that
[01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:07.050] kind
[01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:07.150] of
[01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.450] formal
[01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:07.970] university
[01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:08.550] setting.
[01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:09.170] So
[01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.310] the
[01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:09.570] kind
[01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:09.670] of
[01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:10.190] apprenticeship
[01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.630] model,
[01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.850] like
[01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:11.090] get
[01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:11.250] your
[01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:11.490] hands
[01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:11.750] dirty
[01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:12.010] on
[01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:12.490] effectively
[01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:12.690] a
[01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:12.850] kind
[01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:13.230] of
[01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:13.690] elaborate
[01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:14.190] internship
[01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.450] and
[01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.590] just
[01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:14.810] like
[01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:15.070] never
[01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:15.610] leave.
[01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:16.310] That
[01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:16.450] was
[01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:16.670] still
[01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.870] a
[01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:17.210] viable
[01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.610] path
[01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:17.810] in
[01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:17.970] to
[01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:18.350] conduct
[01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:18.990] really
[01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.790] world
[01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:20.230] class
[01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.570] cutting
[01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:20.750] edge
[01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.230] research.
[01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.870] Then
[01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:22.030] you'd
[01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:22.310] often
[01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:22.910] write
[01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:23.110] your
[01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:23.530] monograph,
[01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.770] your
[01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:23.930] whole
[01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:24.130] book
[01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:24.430] about
[01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.630] it,
[01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:25.130] maybe
[01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.470] deliver
[01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.690] some
[01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:25.970] fancy
[01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:26.450] lectures,
[01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:27.130] maybe
[01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:27.410] some
[01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.510] of
[01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.670] the
[01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:28.150] scholars
[01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.390] at
[01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.510] the
[01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.850] university
[01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:29.030] would
[01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.130] be
[01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:29.330] interested
[01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:29.510] and
[01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.710] maybe
[01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:29.910] write
[01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:30.030] a
[01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:30.350] textbook
[01:05:30.350 --> 01:05:30.530] and
[01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:30.710] maybe
[01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:31.030] lecture
[01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:31.170] on
[01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:31.290] it
[01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:31.430] in
[01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.590] their
[01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:32.010] classes.
[01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.410] But
[01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:32.530] they
[01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:32.610] were
[01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:32.790] kind
[01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:32.890] of,
[01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:33.050] they
[01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:33.190] were
[01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.670] separated.
[01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.470] The
[01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.950] separation
[01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:35.290] begins
[01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:35.470] to
[01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:35.810] be
[01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:36.670] reduced,
[01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:37.710] starting
[01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.930] in
[01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:38.350] the
[01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:39.190] roughly
[01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:40.050] 1850s,
[01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:40.570] 1840s,
[01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:41.150] 1850s.
[01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:41.630] And
[01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.730] they
[01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:42.010] become
[01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:42.330] much,
[01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.550] much
[01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:43.050] closer
[01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:43.690] associated,
[01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:44.930] not
[01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:45.330] automatically,
[01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.630] not
[01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:45.950] without
[01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:46.190] sort
[01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.390] of
[01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:47.190] some
[01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:48.670] switches
[01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.970] back
[01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:49.150] and
[01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.410] forth.
[01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.790] But
[01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:49.970] the
[01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:50.290] trend
[01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:50.550] really
[01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:50.830] sets
[01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:51.010] in
[01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:51.290] starting
[01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:51.390] in
[01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:51.490] the
[01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:51.630] middle
[01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:52.070] 19th
[01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:52.250] century.
[01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.470] Again,
[01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.590] we'll
[01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:52.750] look
[01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.850] at
[01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:52.970] that
[01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:53.070] a
[01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:53.170] bit
[01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:53.350] more
[01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:53.690] directly
[01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.970] next
[01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:54.210] time.
[01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:54.350] So
[01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:54.650] very
[01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.790] good
[01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:55.030] question.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:55.940] So
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.100] another
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:56.380] question
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:56.500] is,
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:56.760] why
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:56.900] do
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:56.980] we
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.120] go
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:57.240] from
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:57.360] the
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:57.720] convention
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:57.920] used
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.140] in
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:58.520] Maxwell
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.300] of
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:05:59.560] denoting
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:05:59.760] the
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:00.120] potential
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:00.380] as
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:00.800] psi
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.020] to
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:01.180] now
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:01.400] using
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:01.520] it
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:01.780] phi?
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.080] Oh,
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:02.280] very
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:02.420] good.
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:02.520] Are
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:02.620] they
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:02.860] different?
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.120] No,
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:03.300] they're
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:03.480] not
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:03.680] different.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:03.860] So
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:04.840] I
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.020] guess
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:05.140] I
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:05.400] skipped
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:05.620] ahead
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:05.720] to
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:05.840] the
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.140] modern.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:06.780] I
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.180] showed
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:07.360] my
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:07.860] prejudices
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:08.120] in
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:08.280] my
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:08.640] slides
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:08.840] here,
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:09.120] just
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:09.340] using
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:09.540] the
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:09.660] Greek
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:09.880] letter
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.160] phi
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:10.320] for
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:10.600] potential.
[01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.350] The
[01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:13.070] short
[01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:13.290] answer
[01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:13.410] is,
[01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.590] I
[01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:13.690] don't
[01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:13.810] know
[01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:13.930] what
[01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:14.110] that
[01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:14.470] particular
[01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.710] letter
[01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:15.190] changed.
[01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:15.750] What
[01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.910] I
[01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:16.110] do
[01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:16.370] know,
[01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.530] and
[01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:16.630] we'll
[01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.870] talk
[01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:17.270] about
[01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.850] again
[01:06:17.850 --> 01:06:18.130] next
[01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:18.450] time,
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:19.680] is
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:19.860] that
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:20.080] as
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:20.280] you
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:20.500] had
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:20.620] a
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:20.840] taste
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.020] of
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:21.240] again
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:21.360] in
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:21.440] the
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:21.600] reader
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.020] today,
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:22.720] Maxwell
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:22.940] was
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:23.140] not
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:23.440] using
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:23.600] any
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:23.700] of
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:23.860] this
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.440] fancy
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:24.760] pants
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.080] vector
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:25.440] stuff,
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:25.740] right?
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:27.180] Maxwell
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:27.820] was
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:28.220] writing
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:28.680] everything
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:28.900] out
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:29.080] in
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:29.540] explicit
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:30.020] Cartesian
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:30.580] coordinates.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.260] That's
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:32.440] probably
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:32.620] why
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:32.700] he
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:32.880] joked
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.060] why
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.200] his
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:33.360] book
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:33.460] was
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:33.700] 900
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:34.180] pages.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:34.420] Like
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:34.500] if
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:34.560] he
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:34.740] just
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:34.920] used
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.220] vectors,
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:35.340] I
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:35.400] think
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:35.480] would
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:35.540] have
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:35.640] been
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:35.840] a
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:36.060] 20
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:36.280] page
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:36.960] pamphlet,
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:37.100] you
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:37.260] know,
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:38.280] we'd
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:38.320] be
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:38.500] done.
[01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:39.690] And
[01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:39.930] so
[01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:40.110] I
[01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:40.250] talk
[01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.390] a
[01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.550] lot
[01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:40.710] about
[01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.850] that,
[01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:41.110] actually,
[01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:41.450] in
[01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.570] the
[01:06:41.570 --> 01:06:41.770] coming
[01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:42.290] class.
[01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.750] So
[01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.870] the
[01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:43.190] particular
[01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.570] question,
[01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:43.750] how
[01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.890] did
[01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:44.110] psi
[01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:44.370] become
[01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:44.730] phi,
[01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:44.970] it's
[01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:45.270] interesting,
[01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:45.390] and
[01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.490] I
[01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:45.630] actually
[01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:45.770] don't
[01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:46.010] know.
[01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:47.790] But
[01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:48.030] the
[01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:48.770] larger
[01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:49.130] question
[01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:49.310] about
[01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:49.910] Maxwell's
[01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:50.470] notation,
[01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:51.190] and
[01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.290] in
[01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:51.550] particular,
[01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.830] how
[01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:51.930] it
[01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:52.010] can
[01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:52.330] become
[01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:52.690] so
[01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:53.430] valuable
[01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.650] for
[01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:53.810] people
[01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:54.050] like
[01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:54.490] us,
[01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:55.030] when
[01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:55.170] he
[01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:55.450] writes
[01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:55.630] these
[01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:56.310] incredibly
[01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:56.890] clunky,
[01:06:57.210 --> 01:06:57.410] pain
[01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:57.490] in
[01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:57.610] the
[01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:57.810] butt
[01:06:57.810 --> 01:06:58.090] kinds
[01:06:58.090 --> 01:06:58.210] of
[01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:58.450] things.
[01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.630] That's
[01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.790] probably
[01:06:58.790 --> 01:06:58.970] why
[01:06:58.970 --> 01:06:59.070] I
[01:06:59.070 --> 01:06:59.230] gave
[01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.310] you
[01:06:59.310 --> 01:06:59.490] those
[01:06:59.490 --> 01:06:59.870] excerpts
[01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:00.030] from
[01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:00.150] his
[01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.450] reader,
[01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.870] from
[01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.990] his
[01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.350] treatise.
[01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:02.050] It
[01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:02.330] doesn't
[01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:02.630] look
[01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.870] just
[01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:03.170] like,
[01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:03.410] you
[01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.530] know,
[01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:03.790] our
[01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:04.050] favorite
[01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:04.410] textbooks
[01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:04.870] today,
[01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:05.230] even
[01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:05.430] when
[01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.590] we're
[01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:05.890] using,
[01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:06.370] quote,
[01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.550] unquote,
[01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:06.770] his
[01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:07.270] equations.
[01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:07.890] So
[01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:07.990] it's
[01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.110] a
[01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:08.350] great
[01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:08.650] question.
[01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:08.790] The
[01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:09.210] conventions
[01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:09.570] actually
[01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:09.850] show
[01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:10.070] a
[01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:10.370] lot
[01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.510] of
[01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.810] interesting
[01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:11.170] stuff,
[01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.330] even
[01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:11.450] the
[01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.750] particular
[01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:12.130] question
[01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:12.610] about
[01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:13.210] sci
[01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:13.470]-fi,
[01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:13.970] I
[01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:14.190] admit,
[01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.310] I
[01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:14.450] don't
[01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.590] know.
[01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:16.090] Regarding
[01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:16.270] the
[01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:16.550] wheels,
[01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.990] pulleys
[01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.190] as
[01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.770] analogies
[01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:17.870] of
[01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:18.030] physical
[01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:18.430] reality,
[01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:18.970] how
[01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:19.170] is
[01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:19.690] continuous
[01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:20.110] rotational
[01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:20.490] symmetry
[01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:20.630] of
[01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.710] the
[01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.930] physics
[01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:21.370] explained?
[01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:21.610] Oh,
[01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.870] that's
[01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:22.130] interesting.
[01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:23.490] I
[01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:23.770] think
[01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:23.930] the
[01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:24.210] idea,
[01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.530] oh,
[01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:24.810] that's
[01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:25.050] good.
[01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:25.450] Yeah,
[01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:25.650] that's
[01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:25.830] good.
[01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.070] So
[01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:26.230] I
[01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.390] think
[01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.590] they
[01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:27.190] gesture
[01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.690] toward
[01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:27.890] it
[01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:28.170] by
[01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:28.450] those
[01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:28.650] like
[01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:29.110] molecular
[01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:29.670] vortices.
[01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:30.410] That's
[01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.490] a
[01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:30.630] kind
[01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.770] of
[01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:31.070] two
[01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:31.890] dimensional
[01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:32.850] slice.
[01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:33.630] And
[01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.730] they
[01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:33.910] certainly
[01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:34.110] were
[01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:34.350] things
[01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:34.670] like
[01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:35.550] spheres.
[01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:35.750] So
[01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.930] a
[01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:36.150] lot
[01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.250] of
[01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:36.350] it,
[01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:36.770] they
[01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:37.010] talked
[01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.210] about
[01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:37.570] ball
[01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:37.910] bearings,
[01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:38.110] they
[01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:38.290] actually
[01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:38.570] have
[01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:39.330] spherical
[01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:39.930] symmetry.
[01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:40.810] And
[01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:40.930] so
[01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:41.110] they
[01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:41.850] constructed
[01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:42.070] even
[01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:42.290] more
[01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:42.690] elaborate
[01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:42.990] kind
[01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.270] of
[01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:44.350] pulleys
[01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:44.510] and
[01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.830] gears.
[01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.450] So
[01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:45.530] they
[01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:45.610] were
[01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:45.990] certainly
[01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.370] very
[01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:46.910] attuned,
[01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:47.310] especially
[01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:47.450] if
[01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:47.450] you
[01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:47.550] think
[01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:47.690] about
[01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:47.870] these
[01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:48.510] mathematical
[01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:49.090] kind
[01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:49.290] of
[01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:50.750] fancy
[01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:51.450] mathematicians
[01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:51.810] like
[01:07:51.810 --> 01:07:52.310] Thompson
[01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:52.430] and
[01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.630] Maxwell,
[01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.490] they're
[01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:53.750] very
[01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:54.070] attuned
[01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:54.190] to
[01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:54.290] what
[01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:54.370] we
[01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:54.470] would
[01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.630] now
[01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.850] call
[01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:55.290] symmetry
[01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:55.750] arguments
[01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.990] in
[01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.250] real
[01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:56.830] space,
[01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:57.110] kind
[01:07:57.110 --> 01:07:57.210] of
[01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:57.590] rotate
[01:07:57.590 --> 01:07:57.790] the
[01:07:57.790 --> 01:07:58.050] system
[01:07:58.050 --> 01:07:58.370] around
[01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:58.630] x,
[01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.850] y,

[01:07:59.010 --> 01:07:59.230] z.
[01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.870] And
[01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:01.030] so
[01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:01.310] a
[01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:01.470] lot
[01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:01.550] of
[01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:01.670] their
[01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.970] models
[01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:02.190] were
[01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.630] actually,
[01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:03.470] frankly,
[01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:03.730] sort
[01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:03.810] of
[01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:04.270] spherical,
[01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:04.710] like,
[01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:05.030] like,
[01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:05.850] like,
[01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:07.690] you
[01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:07.770] know,
[01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:07.930] like,
[01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.450] like
[01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.810] billiard
[01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:09.150] balls,
[01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.410] or
[01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.810] like,
[01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:11.750] you
[01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:12.150] know,
[01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.410] ball
[01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.790] bearings,
[01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.370] as
[01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.490] opposed
[01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.570] to
[01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:13.770] only
[01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:14.150] like,
[01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:15.030] circles.
[01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:16.030] So
[01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.270] we'll
[01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:16.650] come,
[01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:16.830] we'll
[01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:16.970] come
[01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:17.070] to
[01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.210] that
[01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:17.330] as
[01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:17.450] well.
[01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:17.590] These
[01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.650] are
[01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:17.750] all
[01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:17.850] good
[01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:18.190] questions.

[01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:29.010] your

[01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:29.630] point
[01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.790] too,
[01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:29.950] now
[01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:30.050] that
[01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.090] we
[01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:30.190] can

[01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:30.450] each
[01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:30.590] other.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:55.040] I
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:55.240] like
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:55.360] the
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:55.580] comment
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:55.820] about
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.180] putting
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:56.280] your

[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:56.540] in
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:56.720] jelly
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:56.820] and
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:56.920] now
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.040] your
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:57.400] keyboard's
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:57.580] sticky.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:57.780] My
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.140] apologies
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:58.380] for
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:58.520] your
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:58.780] keyboard.
[01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:01.150] Just
[01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:01.310] trying
[01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:01.410] to
[01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:01.510] get
[01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.790] catch
[01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:01.930] up
[01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:02.050] on
[01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:02.170] the
[01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:02.390] chat
[01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.570] here.
[01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:06.030] Ah,
[01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:06.170] good.
[01:09:06.190 --> 01:09:06.330] There's
[01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:06.410] a
[01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:06.570] really
[01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:06.770] interesting
[01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:06.970] comment
[01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:07.230] from
[01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:07.930] Sabrina.
[01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:08.090] I
[01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:08.250] like
[01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:08.410] this.
[01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:08.870] So
[01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:09.130] Sabrina
[01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:09.450] writes
[01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:09.950] that,
[01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:10.410] that,
[01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:11.450] I
[01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.570] don't
[01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.650] know
[01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:11.750] what
[01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:11.850] a
[01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:12.030] gut
[01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.170] is,
[01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:12.290] a
[01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:12.470] grand
[01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.690] unified
[01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.090] theory.
[01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.990] But
[01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.110] it
[01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.270] seems
[01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:14.410] like
[01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:14.530] we're
[01:09:14.530 --> 01:09:14.690] moving
[01:09:14.690 --> 01:09:14.990] back
[01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.210] towards
[01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:15.470] everything
[01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.690] being
[01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:15.850] the
[01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:16.030] same
[01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.270] thing
[01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:16.650] again,
[01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:17.450] with
[01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.650] a
[01:09:17.650 --> 01:09:17.930] little
[01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:18.270] smiley
[01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:18.430] emoji.
[01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.690] So
[01:09:18.690 --> 01:09:19.290] one
[01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:19.370] of
[01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:19.390] the
[01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.530] things
[01:09:19.530 --> 01:09:19.750] that
[01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:21.050] that's,
[01:09:21.150 --> 01:09:21.490] maybe
[01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:21.610] it
[01:09:21.610 --> 01:09:21.730] comes
[01:09:21.730 --> 01:09:21.990] back
[01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.290] actually
[01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:22.730] to
[01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:23.230] Iabo's
[01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:23.450] question.
[01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:23.670] So
[01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:24.530] for
[01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.750] some
[01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:24.850] of
[01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:25.010] these
[01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:25.330] folks,
[01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.770] the
[01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:25.990] ether
[01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.270] was
[01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:26.410] a
[01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:26.650] kind
[01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:27.010] of
[01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:27.470] word
[01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.630] for
[01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.790] something
[01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:27.890] they
[01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:28.030] didn't
[01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.190] really
[01:09:28.190 --> 01:09:28.330] know
[01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:28.450] what
[01:09:28.450 --> 01:09:28.570] it
[01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:28.970] was.
[01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:30.210] A
[01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:30.590] subject,
[01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:31.050] a
[01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:31.410] topic
[01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:31.770] they
[01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:32.650] figured
[01:09:32.650 --> 01:09:32.950] had
[01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:33.090] to
[01:09:33.090 --> 01:09:33.250] be
[01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:33.710] everywhere,
[01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:34.310] because
[01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:34.470] they
[01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.690] could
[01:09:34.690 --> 01:09:35.610] infer
[01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:35.930] its
[01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:36.490] effects.
[01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:37.050] If
[01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:37.210] I
[01:09:37.210 --> 01:09:37.530] wiggle
[01:09:37.530 --> 01:09:37.830] something
[01:09:37.830 --> 01:09:38.110] here,
[01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:38.310] something
[01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:38.630] happens
[01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.790] there,
[01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.970] there
[01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:39.110] must
[01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.230] be
[01:09:39.230 --> 01:09:39.590] some
[01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.970] medium
[01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:40.150] that
[01:09:40.150 --> 01:09:40.570] transmitted
[01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:41.110] the
[01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.810] influence
[01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:41.990] from
[01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.150] A
[01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:42.250] to
[01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:42.550] B.
[01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.590] If
[01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.950] I,
[01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:44.110] you
[01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.150] know,
[01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:44.390] how

[01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.330] And

[01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:52.590] they
[01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:52.770] gave

[01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:53.370] They

[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:03.780] age.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:04.300] They
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:04.500] didn't
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:04.680] know
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:04.900] what
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:05.100] the
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:05.320] ether
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:05.960] was,
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:06.160] but
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:06.280] they
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:06.420] knew
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:06.540] it
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:06.760] had
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:06.900] to
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:07.060] be
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:07.360] there.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:07.540] It
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:07.660] was
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:08.100] conveying
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:08.260] all
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:08.400] these
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:08.780] effects.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:08.920] They
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:09.080] could
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:09.480] measure
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:09.660] the
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:10.060] effects
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:10.480] of
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:10.800] disturbing
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:10.980] the
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:11.160] ether,
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:11.300] as
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:11.400] far
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:11.500] as
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:11.560] they
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:11.660] were
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:12.000] concerned.
[01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:13.310] So
[01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.430] they
[01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.590] gave
[01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.670] it
[01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:13.810] a
[01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:14.050] name,
[01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.190] a
[01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:14.910] placeholder
[01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:15.430] name,
[01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.990] partly
[01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.110] to
[01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.270] help
[01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.690] organize
[01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:16.870] their
[01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:17.250] studies.
[01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.590] Oh,
[01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:17.850] I'm
[01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:18.070] studying
[01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.690] luminiferous
[01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:18.910] ether
[01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:19.110] as
[01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.350] well.
[01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:19.610] That
[01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.850] helps
[01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:20.070] get
[01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.790] scholars
[01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:21.150] on
[01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:21.290] the
[01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.470] same
[01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.910] page.
[01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.710] They
[01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:22.890] would
[01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:23.090] give
[01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.250] their
[01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:23.670] best
[01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:24.630] estimates
[01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.930] of
[01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:25.250] what
[01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.650] they
[01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:25.930] thought
[01:11:25.930 --> 01:11:26.090] the
[01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.230] thing
[01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:26.370] was
[01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:26.570] like,
[01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.670] and
[01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:26.790] how
[01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.910] it
[01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:27.310] behaved.
[01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:27.870] But
[01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.990] they
[01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.170] didn't
[01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:28.490] know,
[01:11:28.690 --> 01:11:28.790] right?
[01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:28.930] They
[01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:29.150] had
[01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:30.030] better
[01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:30.270] or
[01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:30.510] less
[01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.770] well
[01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:31.590] compelling
[01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:32.630] responses.
[01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:34.170] And
[01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:34.350] I
[01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:34.550] think
[01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.690] we're
[01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:34.770] in
[01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:34.850] a
[01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:35.050] very
[01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:35.470] similar
[01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:36.250] situation
[01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:36.530] today,
[01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:36.810] not
[01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:37.030] by
[01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.530] design,
[01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:37.790] not
[01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.990] by
[01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.130] our
[01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:38.350] hopes,
[01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:38.590] because
[01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:38.850] we
[01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:38.970] have
[01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:39.170] been
[01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:39.770] stymied
[01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.550] now
[01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.930] for
[01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:41.550] decades,
[01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:42.470] to
[01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.650] get
[01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:42.930] any
[01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:43.410] more
[01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:43.730] kind
[01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:43.870] of
[01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:44.390] carefully
[01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:45.030] articulated
[01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.750] knowledge
[01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:46.550] about
[01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.950] what
[01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:47.590] specifically
[01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:48.050] is
[01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.310] dark
[01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.590] matter
[01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.750] that
[01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.890] seems
[01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.990] to
[01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.070] be
[01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.250] filling
[01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:49.710] every
[01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:50.170] galaxy,
[01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:51.050] much,
[01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:51.230] much
[01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:51.470] more
[01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.690] so
[01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:51.970] than
[01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:52.390] ordinary
[01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.710] matter.
[01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:53.510] And
[01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.730] what
[01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:54.130] particularly
[01:11:54.130 --> 01:11:54.290] is
[01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.410] this
[01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.690] other
[01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:55.010] separate
[01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.210] kind
[01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:55.310] of
[01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.570] stuff
[01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:55.850] that
[01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:55.950] we
[01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:56.190] now
[01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:56.670] call
[01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:56.890] dark
[01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:57.250] energy.
[01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.890] So
[01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:58.010] I
[01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.190] think
[01:11:58.190 --> 01:11:58.430] we,
[01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.750] again,
[01:11:58.890 --> 01:11:59.610] I
[01:11:59.610 --> 01:11:59.770] don't
[01:11:59.770 --> 01:11:59.870] want
[01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.930] to
[01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:00.030] say
[01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.230] we've
[01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:00.410] learned
[01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:00.730] nothing
[01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:01.050] since
[01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:01.770] 1820,
[01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.430] but
[01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.510] we
[01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.630] can
[01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.810] see
[01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:03.050] some
[01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.890] maybe
[01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:04.990] humbling,
[01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:06.210] humility
[01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:06.690]-inducing
[01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:07.210] parallels
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.280] between
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:08.740] our
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.240] best
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:09.540] efforts
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:09.880] today,
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:10.440] and
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:10.540] the
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:10.740] efforts
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:10.900] of
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.120] very,
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:11.360] very
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:11.700] earnest,
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:12.100] talented
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:12.520] folks
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:13.380] from
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:13.920] long
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.180] ago.
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:14.620] That's
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:14.700] a
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:14.880] great
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.240] point.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:15.560] Again,
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:15.960] we'll
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.160] keep
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:16.300] that
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:16.420] in
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:16.560] mind
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:16.680] as
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:16.760] we
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.180] march
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:17.460] forward
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:17.700] throughout
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:17.920] the
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.140] term.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:19.840] Julian
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.160] asks,
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:20.360] why
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:20.440] are
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:20.540] they
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:20.660] so
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:21.020] reluctant
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:21.220] to
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:21.500] accept
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:21.840] action
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:21.980] at
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:22.120] a
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:22.500] distance,
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:22.760] and
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:22.880] how
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.000] did
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:23.160] we
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:23.300] come
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:23.400] to
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:23.780] accept
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:23.920] it?
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:24.240] Ah,
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:24.460] good.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:24.980] Let
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:24.980] me
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:25.120] take
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:25.220] the
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:25.360] first
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:25.500] part
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:25.700] first.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:26.640] Action

[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:28.380] That's
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:28.480] a

[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:29.140] topic.
[01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:31.210] Newton
[01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:31.690] famously
[01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:32.010] says,

[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.160] He
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:40.360] says,
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:40.700] I
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:41.180] think
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:41.400] that
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.380] quantitatively,

[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:43.400] of

[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.040] divided
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:47.300] by

[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:50.740] What's
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:50.940] the

[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:52.260] He
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:52.420] says,
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:52.540] for

[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.100] no
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:54.740] hypotheses.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:55.660] He
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:55.840] actually
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:55.960] had

[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:56.340] of
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:56.820] hypotheses.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:57.020] He
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:57.140] just
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:57.260] knew
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:57.400] not
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:57.520] to

[01:12:58.860 --> 01:12:59.220] A
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:12:59.440] lot
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:12:59.600] of
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:12:59.920] scholars
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:00.280] have
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:00.500] argued
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:00.660] that
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:00.720] he
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:00.860] was
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:01.200] actually
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:01.840] convinced,
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:02.000] at
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:02.140] least
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:02.340] by
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:02.820] analogy,
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:03.640] that
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:03.960] gravity
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.100] was
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:04.200] a
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:04.340] kind
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:04.440] of
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.020] alchemical
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:05.580] effect,
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:05.960] even
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.140] at
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:06.220] a
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:06.340] time
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:06.480] when
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:06.860] alchemy
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:07.060] was
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:07.300] in
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:07.480] kind
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:07.580] of
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:07.980] poor
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:08.460] repute.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.260] So
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:09.460] he
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:09.760] said
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.360] outwardly
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:10.480] and
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:10.760] publicly,
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.540] I
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:11.660] don't
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:12.000] know
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:12.240] what
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:12.360] it
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:12.600] is,
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:13.080] but
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:13.160] he
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:13.340] seems
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:13.460] to
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:13.500] have
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:13.600] at
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:13.660] least
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:13.800] been
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.400] inspired
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:14.620] in
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.060] part
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:15.780] by
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:15.960] these
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.300] very,
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:16.800] what
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:16.920] we
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.000] would
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:17.160] now
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:17.420] call,
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.100] occult
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:18.700] forces,
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:18.900] where
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:19.240] can
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:19.600] somehow
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:19.880] have
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:19.980] an
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:20.260] influence
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:20.440] on

[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:20.880] else
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.780] instantly
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:22.200] across
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:22.540] time
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:22.700] and
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:23.040] space.
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.300] So
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:24.700] Newton
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.220] was
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:25.440] kind
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:25.560] of
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.060] comfortable
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:26.400] with
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:26.560] the
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:26.880] notion
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.460] of
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:27.800] action
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:27.940] at
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:28.000] a
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:28.340] distance,
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:28.580] that
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:28.760] somehow
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:28.980] the
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:29.160] earth
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:29.360] could
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:29.980] instantly
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:30.340] tug
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:30.480] on
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:30.600] the
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:30.760] moon
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:30.920] and
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.100] vice
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:31.360] versa
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:31.620] without
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:31.900] having
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:32.040] to
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:32.220] wait
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:32.400] for
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:32.600] some
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:32.900] influence
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:33.080] to
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:33.480] travel,
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:34.140] as
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:34.200] you
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:34.380] hear
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:34.480] in
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.020] there.
[01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:36.290] That,
[01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.570] even
[01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:36.710] in
[01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:36.850] its
[01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:37.150] day,
[01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:37.570] was
[01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:37.970] criticized
[01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:38.290] by
[01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:38.410] a
[01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:38.490] number
[01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:38.610] of
[01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:38.830] scholars,
[01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:39.170] even
[01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:39.330] in
[01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:39.650] Newton's
[01:13:39.650 --> 01:13:39.810] own
[01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:40.210] day,
[01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:41.050] because
[01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:41.230] they
[01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:41.390] thought
[01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.510] it
[01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.690] did
[01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:41.910] sound
[01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:42.310] occult.
[01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:42.650] It
[01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:42.950] sounds
[01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:43.290] like
[01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:43.910] kind
[01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:44.030] of
[01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.710] witchcraft.
[01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:45.230] How
[01:13:45.230 --> 01:13:45.390] could
[01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.570] this
[01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:45.710] thing
[01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:46.030] possibly

[01:13:46.450 --> 01:13:46.630] over
[01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:46.890] there
[01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:47.190] if

[01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.510] So

[01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.110] And

[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:38.420] is

[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.040] there's

[01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:42.430] all
[01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.590] these
[01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.890] physical
[01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:43.230] phenomena
[01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:43.510] are

[01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:45.050] across
[01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.430] space.
[01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.910] They're
[01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:46.210] all
[01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:46.530] sitting
[01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:46.690] in
[01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:46.830] this

[01:14:48.490 --> 01:14:48.910] and

[01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:51.670] So
[01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:51.830] there
[01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.970] was,

[01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:56.350] people
[01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.670] wonder
[01:14:56.670 --> 01:14:56.990] about

[01:15:00.150 --> 01:15:00.690] roughly

[01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:01.830] years
[01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:02.190] later,
[01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.750] we

[01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:06.970] that
[01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:07.250] suggests
[01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:07.430] something
[01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.590] that

[01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:16.130] local
[01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:16.670] effects
[01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:17.290] kind
[01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:17.410] of
[01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:17.950] response.
[01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:18.390] So
[01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.610] that
[01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:18.910] starts
[01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:19.210] getting
[01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:20.210] more
[01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:20.330] and
[01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:20.450] more
[01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:21.070] compelling
[01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.710] to
[01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:21.910] this
[01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:22.130] next
[01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.710] generation.
[01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:23.150] Now
[01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:23.990] Julian
[01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.450] asks,
[01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.730] because
[01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:24.890] he
[01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:25.050] knows
[01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:25.250] what's
[01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.490] coming,
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:27.080] why
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:27.200] do
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:27.280] we
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:27.500] now
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:27.780] accept
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:28.020] action
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:28.120] at
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:28.300] distance?
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:28.580] We
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.040] sort
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:29.140] of
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:29.280] do
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:29.420] and
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:29.620] don't,
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:29.720] we
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:29.800] have
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:29.900] a
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:30.060] love
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:30.200]-hate
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:30.620] relationship
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:30.740] with
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:30.820] it.
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:31.220] I
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:31.600] assume,
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:31.980] Julian,
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:32.620] that
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:32.740] you're
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:32.960] referring
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.140] to
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:33.380] quantum
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:33.980] entanglement,
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:34.200] your
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:34.320] so
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:34.520]-called
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:34.960] quantum
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:35.300] non
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:35.840]-locality.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.040] If
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:37.140] you're
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:37.300] not
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:37.500] referring
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:37.600] to
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:37.700] that,
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:37.860] I'm
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:37.940] going
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:38.140] to
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:38.560] hijack
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:38.740] this,
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:39.040] and
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:39.320] I'm
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:39.360] going
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:39.400] to
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:39.540] talk
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:39.680] about
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:39.760] it,
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:39.880] because
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:39.980] I
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:40.140] just
[01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:40.400] love
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:40.540] it.
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:40.920] So
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.080] we're
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:41.120] going
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:41.160] to
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:41.360] talk
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:41.500] about
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:41.660] that,
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:41.860] actually,
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:41.960] in
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.020] a
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:42.120] few
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:42.520] classes
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:42.780] a
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:42.880] little
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.000] bit
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:43.160] later
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:43.400] this
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:43.660] term.
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:44.360] So
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:44.620] how
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:44.800] have
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:44.900] we
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:45.180] made
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:45.440] our
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:45.680] kind
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:45.840] of
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:46.640] awkward
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.020] piece
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:47.180] with
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:47.340] a
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:47.600] very
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:47.960] certain
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.360] kind
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:48.500] of
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:48.760] action
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:48.900] at
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:49.300] distance,
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:50.040] not
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:50.400] easily,
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:50.700] not
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:50.880] right
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:51.180] away,
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:51.380] and
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:51.620] thanks
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:51.800] to
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:51.960] a
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.160] lot
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:52.380] of
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:53.460] hard
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:53.600] and
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.060] contested
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:54.320] thinking?
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:54.580] That's
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:54.700] a
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:54.980] preview
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:55.440] for
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.420] lecture
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:57.520] 12,
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:57.760] I
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:57.960] think.
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:58.120] So
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:58.380] we're
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:15:58.460] going
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:58.600] to
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:58.980] talk
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:15:59.180] about
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:15:59.720] quantum
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:00.400] non
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:00.980]-locality.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:01.600] This
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:01.660] is
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:01.780] one
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:01.840] of
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:01.960] my
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.180] favorite
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:02.520] topics
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:02.660] in
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:02.760] the
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:02.960] universe.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:03.220] We'll
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:03.560] get
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:03.660] to
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:03.760] that
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:03.940] too.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.040] But
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:05.160] for
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:05.300] a
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:05.540] long,
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:05.760] long
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:06.240] time,
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:07.060] between,
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:07.380] let's
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:07.600] say,
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:07.680] you
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:07.820] know,
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.280] 1800
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:08.900] and
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.100] the
[01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.790] 1960s,
[01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:11.330] 70s,
[01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.850] people
[01:16:11.850 --> 01:16:11.990] were
[01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.290] quite
[01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.650] content
[01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:12.890] to
[01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:13.150] say
[01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:13.450] that
[01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:13.870] action
[01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.990] at
[01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.210] distance
[01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:14.450] is
[01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.870] always,
[01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:15.170] always
[01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:15.590] bad.
[01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.910] We
[01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:16.210] never
[01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:16.470] want
[01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.610] it.
[01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:16.770] We
[01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:17.010] never
[01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:17.190] want
[01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:17.270] it
[01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.350] in
[01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.450] our
[01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:17.770] physics.
[01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.270] And
[01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:18.370] they
[01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:18.590] had
[01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.970] a
[01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:19.290] range
[01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:19.430] of
[01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.670] reasons
[01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:19.830] why
[01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.930] they
[01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:20.130] thought
[01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:20.310] that
[01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.550] was
[01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.670] going
[01:16:20.670 --> 01:16:20.710] to
[01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:20.790] be
[01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.910] an
[01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:21.210] acceptable
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.780] approach.
[01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:24.110] Aidan
[01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.610] asks,
[01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:25.430] how
[01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:26.170] accessible
[01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:26.410] were
[01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:26.530] the
[01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:26.850] lectures
[01:16:26.850 --> 01:16:26.970] in
[01:16:26.970 --> 01:16:27.110] later
[01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.550] universities'
[01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:28.090] research?
[01:16:28.890 --> 01:16:29.090] I
[01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:29.310] mentioned
[01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.490] that
[01:16:29.490 --> 01:16:29.770] Faraday
[01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:29.910] did
[01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:30.050] not
[01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:30.190] have
[01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:30.350] much
[01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.610] money
[01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:30.770] when
[01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.830] he
[01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.950] was
[01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:31.230] younger,
[01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:31.830] but
[01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.910] he
[01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:32.050] was
[01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:32.170] the,
[01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:32.630] was
[01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.730] the
[01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:32.990] exception
[01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.170] the
[01:16:33.170 --> 01:16:33.370] rule?
[01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.570] Did
[01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:33.930] class
[01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:34.350] discrimination
[01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.610] prevent?
[01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:35.050] Oh,
[01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:35.250] yeah,
[01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.450] very
[01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:35.610] good.
[01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:36.070] So
[01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.330] in
[01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:36.610] Britain,
[01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:37.010] in
[01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:37.230] British
[01:16:37.230 --> 01:16:37.630] history,
[01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:38.790] I
[01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.930] mean,
[01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:39.190] the
[01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:39.430] rough
[01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:40.030] shorthand
[01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.150] is
[01:16:40.150 --> 01:16:40.330] we're
[01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:40.630] always
[01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.890] talking
[01:16:40.890 --> 01:16:41.070] about
[01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:41.310] class
[01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:41.810] discrimination.
[01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:42.430] So
[01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:42.930] including
[01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:43.090] in
[01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:43.450] Faraday's
[01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:43.590] time,
[01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:43.810] Faraday
[01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:43.970] was
[01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:44.450] absolutely
[01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:45.170] the
[01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:45.490] exception
[01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:45.670] who
[01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:45.910] proved
[01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:46.050] the
[01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:46.250] rule.
[01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.470] It
[01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.730] was,
[01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:46.870] as
[01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.950] I
[01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:47.070] say,
[01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.250] this
[01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:47.570] rags
[01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.710] to
[01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:47.870] riches
[01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:48.430] story.
[01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.490] It
[01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:49.790] wasn't
[01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.930] that
[01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:50.330] there
[01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:50.470] was
[01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.730] no
[01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:51.130] social
[01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:51.610] mobility,
[01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:51.850] and
[01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:51.970] you
[01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:52.090] can
[01:16:52.090 --> 01:16:52.330] read
[01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:52.670] any

[01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.650] Dickens
[01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:53.950] novel
[01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:54.110] to
[01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.230] see
[01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:54.430] some
[01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:54.790] characters
[01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:55.070] who
[01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.430] have
[01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.550] a
[01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.810] breakthrough
[01:16:55.810 --> 01:16:56.250] and
[01:16:56.250 --> 01:16:56.750] rise
[01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.950] above
[01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:57.130] their
[01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:57.470] station
[01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.670] in
[01:16:57.670 --> 01:16:57.770] the
[01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:58.070] language
[01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.230] of
[01:16:58.230 --> 01:16:58.310] the
[01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.530] time.
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:16:59.440] But
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:16:59.920] in
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:00.540] natural
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:00.980] philosophy,
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:01.380] Faraday
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:01.780] stands
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:02.060] out
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:02.300] as
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:02.400] a
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:02.520] pretty
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:02.880] unusual
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:03.460] case.
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:04.540] And
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:04.640] the
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.000] universities
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:05.280] as
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:05.440] well,
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:05.680] there
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:05.920] were
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.680] more
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.760] scholarship
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.400] students
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:09.880] at
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.120] places
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:10.340] like
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:10.860] Cambridge
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:12.000] than
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:12.160] is
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:12.380] now.
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:12.520] So
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:12.620] it
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:12.860] wasn't
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:13.300] only
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:13.800] very,
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:14.140] very
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:14.480] rich,
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:15.040] children
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:15.220] of
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:15.400] very
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:15.600] rich
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:15.900] families
[01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:16.020] who
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:16.120] could
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:16.240] go
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:16.360] to
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:16.820] university,
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:17.420] but
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:17.480] it
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:17.580] was
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:17.860] tilted
[01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:18.080] very
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:18.420] strongly
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:18.620] that
[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:18.920] way.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:19.860] And
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:19.940] in
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:20.120] fact,
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:20.280] it's
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:20.580] only
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:20.760] in
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:20.960] Britain
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.300] in
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:21.620] the
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:22.100] middle
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:22.460] decades
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:22.620] of
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:22.760] the
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:23.340] 20th
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:23.600] century,
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:23.860] like
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:24.240] 100
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:24.580] years
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:24.960] after
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:25.580] the
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:25.800] days
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:25.940] of

[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:26.800] Maxwell,
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:27.560] was
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:27.760] a
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.120] very
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:28.500] large

[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:29.260] reform
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:29.580] throughout
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:29.960] Britain
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:30.500] to
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:30.680] make
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.060] much
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:31.640] more
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:32.220] accessible,
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:32.900] you
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.060] know,
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:33.380] colleges,
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:33.840] universities
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.180] for
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:34.640] many,
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:34.840] many

[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:35.300] for

[01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:37.430] That
[01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.550] kind
[01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.690] of
[01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:38.050] large

[01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.850] national
[01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:39.190] university
[01:17:39.190 --> 01:17:39.570] reform
[01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:40.070] comes
[01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.710] really
[01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:40.870] in
[01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:41.130] earnest,
[01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:41.390] like
[01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.790] 100
[01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:42.130] years
[01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:42.470] later.
[01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:43.070] So
[01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.270] there
[01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.510] were
[01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.910] students
[01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:44.190] on
[01:17:44.190 --> 01:17:44.490] fellowship.
[01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.690] In
[01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:44.850] fact,
[01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.250] Isaac
[01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:45.510] Newton
[01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.730] was
[01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:45.870] a
[01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:46.150] scholarship
[01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:46.550] student
[01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.750] when
[01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.830] he
[01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.930] went
[01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:47.070] to
[01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.370] Cambridge
[01:17:47.370 --> 01:17:47.910] in
[01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:48.090] his
[01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:48.250] own
[01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:48.530] lifetime
[01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:48.770] in
[01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:49.130] the
[01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:50.430] 1600s.
[01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:52.010] Often
[01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.210] they
[01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:52.330] would
[01:17:52.330 --> 01:17:52.530] have
[01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:52.750] to
[01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:53.050] be
[01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:53.390] basically
[01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.730] like
[01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:54.350] a
[01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.690] butler
[01:17:54.690 --> 01:17:54.990] or
[01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.490] a
[01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:55.870] maid
[01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:56.170] for
[01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:56.410] their
[01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:57.230] roommates.
[01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.950] Not
[01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:58.130] an
[01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.390] ideal
[01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.870] situation,
[01:17:58.990 --> 01:17:59.130] right?
[01:17:59.170 --> 01:17:59.290] This
[01:17:59.290 --> 01:17:59.390] was
[01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.530] not
[01:17:59.530 --> 01:17:59.770] like
[01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:00.150] work
[01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:00.550] study.
[01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:01.050] It
[01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:01.130] was
[01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:01.270] like
[01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.470] you
[01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:01.690] have
[01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:01.810] to
[01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:01.970] go
[01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:02.270] clean
[01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.430] up
[01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:02.610] for
[01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:02.930] your
[01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:03.370] rich
[01:18:03.370 --> 01:18:03.670] roommate,
[01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:04.130] not
[01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:04.590] what
[01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:04.670] I
[01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:04.930] recommend
[01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:05.130] today.
[01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.530] So
[01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:05.690] there
[01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:05.830] were
[01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:06.210] ways
[01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:06.350] to
[01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.590] be
[01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:07.050] a
[01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:07.510] student
[01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.750] at
[01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.870] some
[01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:07.910] of
[01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:08.010] these
[01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:08.250] elite
[01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:08.470] British
[01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.910] universities
[01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:09.470] from
[01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.970] more
[01:18:09.970 --> 01:18:10.450] humble
[01:18:10.450 --> 01:18:10.890] backgrounds,
[01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:11.170] not
[01:18:11.170 --> 01:18:11.390] great.
[01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.310] This
[01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.450] was
[01:18:12.450 --> 01:18:12.790] well
[01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:13.090] outside
[01:18:13.090 --> 01:18:13.290] the
[01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:13.470] reach
[01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.570] of
[01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:13.710] someone
[01:18:13.710 --> 01:18:13.890] like
[01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:14.290] Faraday.
[01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:14.510] So
[01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.950] again,
[01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:15.350] the
[01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.570] latter
[01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:15.790] didn't
[01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:16.110] extend
[01:18:16.110 --> 01:18:16.310] sort
[01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.590] of
[01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:17.330] arbitrarily
[01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.710] low.
[01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:18.470] But
[01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.610] there
[01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:19.050] was
[01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:19.210] a
[01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:19.590] range
[01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.810] of
[01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:20.070] social
[01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.510] classes
[01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.670] and
[01:18:20.670 --> 01:18:21.010] universities
[01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:21.210] in
[01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:21.330] this
[01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:21.610] time,
[01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:22.190] not
[01:18:22.190 --> 01:18:23.030] a
[01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.290] full
[01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:23.710] range.
[01:18:23.970 --> 01:18:24.270] And
[01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.470] that
[01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.690] begins
[01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:24.830] to
[01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:25.050] change
[01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:25.570] pretty
[01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:26.070] slowly
[01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.810] all
[01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:27.030] over
[01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.170] the
[01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:27.350] world,
[01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.690] including
[01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:27.810] in
[01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:27.970] Britain,
[01:18:28.090 --> 01:18:28.390] including
[01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.730] frankly,
[01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.890] in
[01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:28.910] the
[01:18:28.910 --> 01:18:29.050] United
[01:18:29.050 --> 01:18:29.410] States.
[01:18:29.730 --> 01:18:29.850] And
[01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:29.950] of
[01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:30.050] course,
[01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.170] we
[01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:30.330] still
[01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:30.510] have
[01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.830] challenges
[01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:31.010] even
[01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.350] here.
[01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:32.110] So
[01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.310] that's
[01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.390] a
[01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.510] great
[01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.830] question.
[01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:33.230] Faraday
[01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:33.470] was
[01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.730] indeed
[01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:33.890] the
[01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:34.230] exception
[01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:34.530] who
[01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:35.510] proves
[01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.630] the
[01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.770] rule
[01:18:35.770 --> 01:18:36.010] within
[01:18:36.010 --> 01:18:36.330] natural
[01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:36.890] philosophy.
[01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:38.570] Yeah,
[01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.310] great
[01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:39.690] question.
[01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:40.030] Any
[01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:40.190] other
[01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:40.490] questions
[01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:40.650] there?
[01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:40.770] If
[01:18:40.770 --> 01:18:40.870] not,
[01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:41.110] I
[01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.390] realize
[01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.550] we're
[01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.830] pretty
[01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:42.070] much
[01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.810] at
[01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:42.950] the
[01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:43.270] hour.
[01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.830] Those
[01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.910] are
[01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:45.230] great
[01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:45.630] questions.
[01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:45.870] Thank
[01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:45.950] you
[01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:46.030] so
[01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.130] much.
[01:18:46.190 --> 01:18:46.270] I
[01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.490] hope
[01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.670] it's
[01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:46.850] not
[01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:47.090] too
[01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.430] clunky.
[01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.610] We'll
[01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:47.770] try
[01:18:47.770 --> 01:18:47.870] to
[01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.990] get
[01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.190] better.
[01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:48.330] I'll
[01:18:48.330 --> 01:18:48.390] try
[01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.470] to
[01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.590] get
[01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.810] better
[01:18:48.810 --> 01:18:49.410] at
[01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:50.030] flowing
[01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.290] in
[01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:50.390] the
[01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.670] questions
[01:18:50.670 --> 01:18:50.790] and
[01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:51.090] discussions
[01:18:51.090 --> 01:18:51.410] throughout
[01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:51.670] these
[01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:52.090] Zoom
[01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:52.450] lectures.
[01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:53.470] Anyway,
[01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:53.830] thanks,
[01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:54.110] everyone.
[01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:54.490] Great,
[01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.650] great
[01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:55.110] questions.
[01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:55.710] I'll
[01:18:55.710 --> 01:18:56.010] post
[01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:56.110] the
[01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.310] video
[01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.450] as
[01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.510] soon
[01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.630] as
[01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.710] it's
[01:18:56.710 --> 01:18:56.850] done
[01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:57.330] processing.
[01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:57.470] It
[01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.510] will
[01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.650] go
[01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:57.770] to
[01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:57.890] the
[01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:58.110] Canvas
[01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.430] site.
[01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:59.030] And
[01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.110] we'll
[01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.290] pick
[01:18:59.290 --> 01:18:59.370] it
[01:18:59.370 --> 01:18:59.470] up
[01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.730] there
[01:18:59.730 --> 01:18:59.910] for
[01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:00.250] next
[01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:00.510] week.
[01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:00.830] Everyone
[01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:01.050] stay
[01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:01.350] well.
[01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:02.070] See
[01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.170] you
[01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:02.330] soon.
