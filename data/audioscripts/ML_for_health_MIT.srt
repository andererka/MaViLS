[00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.330] So
[00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.670] last
[00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.890] time,
[00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.050] we
[00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.350] talked
[00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.630] about
[00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.930] what
[00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.330] medicine
[00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.850] does.
[00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.850] And
[00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.310] today,
[00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.590] I
[00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.750] want
[00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.850] to
[00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.210] take
[00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.370] a
[00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.590] deep
[00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.930] dive
[00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.290] into
[00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.650] medical
[00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.090] data.
[00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.490] And
[00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.690] I'm
[00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.870] going
[00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.090] to
[00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.470] use
[00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.850] as
[00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.510] examples
[00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.550] a
[00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.710] lot
[00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.850] of
[00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.090] stuff
[00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.330] from
[00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.510] the
[00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.750] MIMIC
[00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.330] database,
[00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.590] which
[00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.770] is
[00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.970] one
[00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.090] of
[00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.230] the
[00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.730] databases
[00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.670] that
[00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.850] we're
[00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.050] going
[00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.210] to
[00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.370] be
[00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.710] using
[00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.050] in
[00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.270] this
[00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.670] class.
[00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.330] Some
[00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.490] of
[00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.610] you
[00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.730] are
[00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.090] probably
[00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.510] familiar
[00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.890] with
[00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.110] it,
[00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.650] and
[00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.890] some
[00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.050] of
[00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.170] you
[00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.290] are
[00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.570] not.
[00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.890] And
[00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.070] there
[00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.310] are,
[00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.610] I
[00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.890] hope,
[00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.170] some
[00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.590] takeaway
[00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.050] lessons
[00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.610] from
[00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.030] this
[00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.550] discussion.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.640] So
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.920] for
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.380] example,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.920] a
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.080] few
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.380] years
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.700] ago,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.980] when
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.840] MIMIC
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.140] 3
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.260] was
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.720] about
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.920] to
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.120] be
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.540] released,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.760] I
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.940] was
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.300] playing
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.540] with
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.700] the
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.980] data.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.000] And
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.280] I
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.600] looked
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.020] at
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.480] the
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.360] distribution
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.900] of

[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.620] rates
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.620] in
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.840] the

[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.240] database.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.880] So
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.220] MIMIC,
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.480] for
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.720] those

[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.100] who
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.420] don't

[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.040] years.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.080] And
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.500] one
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.700] of
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.440] the

[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.800] difficulties
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.160] that
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.340] we
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.740] encountered
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.020] is
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.220] that
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.340] in

[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.780] period,
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.620] the
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.000] hospital
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.580] shifted
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.080] from
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.360] one
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.900] information
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.520] system
[00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.220] that
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.400] they
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.720] used
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.880] in
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.040] their
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.440] intensive
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.780] care
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.080] unit
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.320] to
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.680] another.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.440] Care
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.620] view
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.840] is
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.000] the
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.220] old
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.480] one.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.960] MetaVision
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.200] is
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.400] the
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.560] new
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.820] one.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.460] And
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.620] of
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.840] course,
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.060] they're
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.260] not
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.680] exactly
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.300] compatible.
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.600] So
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.800] we'll
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.060] see
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.020] some
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.480] examples
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.760] of
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.960] that.
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.580] So
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.840] this
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.000] is
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.200] the
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.440] old
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.800] data.
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.160] So
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.400] this
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.560] is
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.820] from
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.060] care
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.320] view.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.400] And
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.660] you
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.880] look
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.040] at
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.320] that
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.480] and
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.720] say,
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.960] well,
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.300] heart
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.620] rates
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.000] range
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.480] from
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.600] 40
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.860] to
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.380] 200,
[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.960] roughly,
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.860] which
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.040] is
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.460] OK.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.520] But
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.840] then
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.200] there's
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.500] this
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.780] funny
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.200] thing.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.560] There
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.720] are
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.960] two
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.320] peaks.
[00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.750] So
[00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.310] where,
[00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.590] if
[00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.870] ever,
[00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.170] do
[00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.330] you
[00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.650] see
[00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.990] two
[00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.370] peaks
[00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.470] in
[00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.070] physiological
[00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.850] data?
[00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.310] Not
[00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.770] typical.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.360] And
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.660] so
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.020] my
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.660] initial
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.340] reaction
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.420] was,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.720] so
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.400] then
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.560] I
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.800] looked
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.960] a
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.160] little
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.040] closer.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.320] And
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.460] I
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.720] said,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.060] hmm,
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.540] what
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.640] do
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.800] the
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.040] heart
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.340] rates
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.640] look
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.000] like
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.320] from
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.580] these
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.800] two
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.260] systems?
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.580] And
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.760] if
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.880] you
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.100] look
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.300] in
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.480] care
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.680] view,
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.880] you
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.100] see
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.280] the
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.600] picture
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.820] that
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.980] I
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.160] just
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.420] showed
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.580] you.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.740] And
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.880] if
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.020] you
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.220] look
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.360] in
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.860] MetaVision,
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.660] you
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.940] see
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.200] this
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.440] other
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.800] picture,
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.140] which
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.460] looks
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.760] more
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.060] like
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.280] what
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.420] you
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.620] would
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.260] normally
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.780] expect.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.660] And
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.840] so
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.020] I'm
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.260] sitting
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.520] there
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.940] scratching
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.240] my
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.480] head,
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.860] going,
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.200] OK,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.380] there
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.640] must
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.840] be
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.100] some
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.600] difference
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.720] between
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.140] these.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.980] It's
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.340] not
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.140] that,
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.360] simultaneous
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.920] with
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.140] the
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.640] switchover
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.900] of
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.060] the
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.460] hospital
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.220] from
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.480] one
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.980] information
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.440] system
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.720] to
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.120] another,
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.460] physiology
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.080] of
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.440] people
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.040] changed.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.300] And
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.460] all
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.580] of
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.720] a
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.960] sudden,
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.740] some
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.080] subset
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.340] of
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.720] people
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.960] started
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.380] having
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.940] faster
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.240] heart
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.580] rates.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.100] But
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.260] if
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.380] you
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.620] think
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.880] about
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.180] that,
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.500] what
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.900] subset
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.120] of
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.420] people
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.760] have
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.220] faster
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.520] heart
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.880] rates?
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.360] Hmm?
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.680] Babies?
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.760] If
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.880] you're
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.960] in
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.040] a
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.240] stress
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.500] test.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.180] Hmm.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.400] The
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.640] children?
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.600] Yeah,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.100] kids.
[00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.710] Right?
[00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.670] So
[00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.870] I
[00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.130] said,
[00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.510] hmm,
[00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.090] interesting.
[00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.790] So
[00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.070] anyway,
[00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.330] if
[00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.430] you
[00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.630] look
[00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.770] at
[00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.970] the
[00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.470] statistics,
[00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.350] you
[00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.590] see
[00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.790] that
[00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.010] the
[00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.190] mean
[00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.510] heart
[00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.830] rate
[00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.130] in
[00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.330] care
[00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.590] view
[00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.870] is
[00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.510] 108.
[00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.830] And
[00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.970] the
[00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.150] mean
[00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.730] heart
[00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.130] rate
[00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.290] in
[00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.710] MetaVision
[00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.070] is
[00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.810] 87.
[00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.290] But
[00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.490] of
[00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.770] course,
[00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.650] means
[00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.250] are
[00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.450] not
[00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.710] that
[00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.150] meaningful
[00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.430] when
[00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.610] you
[00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.890] look
[00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.210] at
[00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.430] these
[00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.950] bimodal
[00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.590] distributions.
[00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.650] So
[00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.830] then
[00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.990] I
[00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.190] said,
[00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.370] well,
[00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.570] what
[00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.710] if
[00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.830] we
[00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.050] just
[00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.290] look
[00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.530] at
[00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.130] adults?
[00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.870] So
[00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.950] we
[00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.190] look
[00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.330] at
[00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.670] people
[00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.230] from
[00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.110] age
[00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.930] greater
[00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.230] than
[00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.530] 1
[00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.750] up
[00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.090] to
[00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.450] age
[00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.870] 90.
[00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.450] And
[00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.650] I'll
[00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.950] say
[00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:55.110] a
[00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.250] word
[00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.490] about
[00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.750] that
[00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.890] in
[00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.030] a
[00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.190] minute.
[00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.010] And
[00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.270] I
[00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.470] look
[00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.610] at
[00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.810] those
[00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.010] two
[00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.610] distributions.
[00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.990] They
[00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.190] look
[00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.430] pretty
[00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.830] close.
[00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.210] They
[00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.410] look
[00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.650] pretty
[00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.030] similar.
[00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.210] So
[00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.470] that
[00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.790] means
[00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.190] that
[00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.230] the
[00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.190] number
[00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.470] of
[00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.970] patients
[00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:06.350] of
[00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.730] different
[00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.110] ages
[00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.510] in
[00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.670] the
[00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.970] adult
[00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.350] group
[00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.130] is
[00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.590] similar
[00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.870] in
[00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.010] the
[00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.170] two
[00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.450] data
[00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.890] sets.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.460] But
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.620] if
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.780] I
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.240] don't
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.820] exclude
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.900] the
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.340] very
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.720] young
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.900] or
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.080] the
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.320] very
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.720] old,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.500] then
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.660] I
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.920] see
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.160] this
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.460] funny
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.180] distribution
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.440] where
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.620] I
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.880] have
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.380] suppressed
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.740] ages
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.120] greater
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.400] than
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.780] 90,
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.060] but
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.400] not
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.620] the
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.880] young.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.900] And
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.080] what
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.240] you
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.520] see
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.720] is
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.920] that
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.120] in
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.300] care
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.540] view,
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.900] there's
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.120] this
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.460] giant
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.040] spike
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.420] at
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.660] age
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.020] 0.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.620] So
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.840] what
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.320] happened
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.080] at
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.280] the
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.700] hospital
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.600] is
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.860] that
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.160] under
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.420] the
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.660] old
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.180] system,
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.660] it
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.920] was
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.320] also
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.680] being
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.140] used
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.480] in
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.640] the
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.000] NICU,
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.740] the
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.300] Neonatal
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.800] Intensive
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.060] Care
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.340] Unit.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.340] The
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.580] new
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.900] system
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.180] was
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.420] not
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.680] being
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.000] used
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.180] in
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.320] the
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.660] NICU.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.980] And
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.460] therefore,
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.080] they
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.340] didn't
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.720] capture
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.140] data
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.520] about
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.960] babies.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.240] And
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.440] in
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.720] fact,
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.940] if
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.080] you
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.420] look
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.380] at
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.220] age
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.740] versus
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.100] heart
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.420] rate
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.200] of
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.380] the
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.720] entire
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.460] population,
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.520] you
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.940] see
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.240] two
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.580] very
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.980] peculiar
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.580] things.
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.400] So
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.040] here
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.180] are
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.360] the
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.800] adults
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.100] that
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.380] we've
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.520] been
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.860] talking
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.300] about.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.240] And
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.500] here
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.620] are
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.780] the
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.160] babies.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.480] And
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.680] sure
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.940] enough,
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.160] they
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.380] have
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.660] higher
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.960] heart
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.320] rates.
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.240] And
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.440] then
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.680] here
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.840] are
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.040] these

[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.780] don't
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.060] think
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.280] I'm

[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.260] rate

[00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.770] somebody
[00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.410] who
[00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.590] is
[00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.910] 90
[00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:05.230] years
[00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.530] old
[00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.770] or
[00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.170] older.
[00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.990] And
[00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.870] the
[00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.110] reason
[00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.410] is
[00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.610] because
[00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.830] the
[00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.110] number
[00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.390] of
[00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.030] 97
[00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.350]-year
[00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.650]-olds
[00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.350] is
[00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.610] pretty
[00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.090] small.
[00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.850] And
[00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.070] so
[00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.270] if
[00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.450] I
[00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.690] tell
[00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.910] you
[00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.210] that
[00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.450] Willie
[00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.670] is
[00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.110] 97
[00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.610] years
[00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.970] old,
[00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.650] then
[00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.870] you're
[00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.970] going
[00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.050] to
[00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.210] be
[00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.390] able
[00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.550] to
[00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.790] pick
[00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.930] him
[00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.110] out
[00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.230] of
[00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.370] a
[00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.970] population
[00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:19.630] relatively
[00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.110] easily.
[00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.850] And
[00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:21.050] so
[00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.330] it's
[00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.770] prohibited
[00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.230] to
[00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.450] say
[00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.770] that.
[00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.850] So
[00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.210] as
[00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.350] a
[00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.730] result,
[00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.410] everybody
[00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.770] who's
[00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.090] 90
[00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.310] or
[00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.670] older
[00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.470] gets
[00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.910] labeled
[00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.210] as
[00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.470] being
[00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.950] 300
[00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.350] years
[00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.670] old
[00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.150] in
[00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.290] the
[00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.610] database.
[00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.570] It's
[00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.710] an
[00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.050] artifact.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.000] Right?
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.100] It's
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.420] like
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.160] back
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.480] in
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.160] my
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.120] youth,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.460] I
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.780] worked
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.020] as
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.180] a
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.520] computer
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.120] programmer
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.960] at
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.080] a
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.300] health
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.760] sciences
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.300] computing
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.880] facility
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.160] at
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.620] UCLA.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.540] And
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.720] we
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.900] used
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.020] to
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.160] have
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.320] a
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.780] convention
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.360] that
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.720] missing
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.080] data
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.380] was
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.960] represented
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.300] by
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.420] 99999.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.720] And
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.920] of
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.120] course,
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.340] if
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.500] you
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.980] average
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.300] that
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.880] into
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.720] a
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.920] real
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.240] data
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.580] set,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.760] you
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.000] get
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.540] garbage,
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.800] which
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.120] people
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.420] did
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.960] regularly.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.800] So
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.120] there
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.520] are
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.900] problems
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.260] with
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.520] this.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.680] And
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.880] we're
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.160] running
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.420] into
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.620] one
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.740] of
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.960] those.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:05.700] If
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.820] you
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.080] look
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.260] at
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.880] just
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.100] the
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.600] adults,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.300] the
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.520] two
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.940] systems
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.400] actually
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.720] look
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.980] very
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.380] similar.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.740] So
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.040] the
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.640] blue
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.820] and
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.020] red
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.500] dots
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:14.680] are
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.880] the
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.080] two
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.620] systems.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.320] And
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.600] I've
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.000] drawn
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.780] the
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.100] trend
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.460] lines
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.860] between
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.140] them.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.280] And
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.420] you
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.580] can
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:19.800] see
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.980] that
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.180] they're
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.400] very
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.700] similar.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.800] So
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.140] it
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.380] looks
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.660] like
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:22.900] as
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.040] you
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.220] get
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.520] older,
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.860] your
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.120] heart
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.360] rate
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.080] declines
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.480] very
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.960] slightly.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.360] But
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.500] it
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.720] does
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.000] so
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.460] equally
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.720] in
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:28.840] the
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.020] two
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.240] data
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.960] sets.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.160] Yeah?
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.400] On
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.580] the
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:30.860] previous
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.120] slide,
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.780] beyond
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.180] 300,
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.360] it
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.500] looks
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.700] like
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.840] there
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:32.980] are
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.240] people
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.580] who
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.680] are
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.100] older
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.340] than
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.620] 300.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.500] Well,
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:35.860] that's
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.200] because
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.640] the
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.180] ages
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.480] there
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.800] are
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.320] computed
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.780] at
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:38.980] the
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.280] time
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:39.500] that
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:39.680] the
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:39.920] heart
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.160] rate
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.400] is
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.780] measured.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.200] And
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.520] so
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.920] if
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.160] you
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.440] are
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.180] 300
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.620] years
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:43.960] old
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.140] when
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:44.380] you're
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:44.660] admitted
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:44.900] to
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.060] the
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.500] hospital,
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.260] if
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.400] you
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.700] stay
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.860] in
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:46.980] the
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.300] hospital
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.720] for
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.020] six
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.400] months,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.160] then
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.420] you're
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:49.900] 300
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.180] and
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.480] 1⁄2
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.780] years
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.100] old
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.340] by
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.520] the
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:51.860] time
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.060] of
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.260] that
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.680] measurement.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.480] So
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.800] that's
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.000] why
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.220] there
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:54.380] are
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.720] data
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.100] points
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.340] to
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:55.520] the
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:55.780] right
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.260] of
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.280] 300.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.100] Yeah,
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.600] good
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.300] catch.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.520] OK,
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:01.840] and
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.000] then
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.240] this
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.380] is
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:02.540] what
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:02.720] the
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.020] babies
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.280] look
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.560] like.
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:03.700] And
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:03.860] of
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.040] course,
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.240] they
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.420] do
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:04.640] have
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:04.940] higher
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.180] heart
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.500] rates.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:06.980] And
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.240] here
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.700] are
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:07.840] the
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.320] oldsters.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:08.760] So
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.320] actually,
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:09.640] there
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:09.920] are
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.120] people
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.460] out
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:11.680] to
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.520] 310
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.100] years
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.940] old
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:14.880] because
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.460] maybe
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:15.760] they
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.060] were
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.560] discharged
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:16.880] from
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.040] the
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.420] hospital.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.700] And
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:18.920] then
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.080] at
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:19.300] age
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.620] 100,
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.020] they
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.300] came
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:20.720] back.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.020] Maybe
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.260] they
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:22.380] were
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:22.700] 90
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.000] years
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.280] old
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:23.460] at
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:23.620] the
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:23.860] time
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.060] they
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.360] were
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.080] initially
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.500] admitted.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:25.700] 10
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.080] years
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.380] later,
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:26.620] they
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:26.860] came
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.180] back.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:27.720] And
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:27.900] we
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.300] recorded
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.640] more
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:28.920] data
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.280] about
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:29.540] them.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:29.700] And
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:29.840] so
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.080] this
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.240] is
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.420] all
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:30.840] relative
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.240] to
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:31.980] that
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.460] 300.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:33.860] OK,
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.120] so
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.440] that's
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:34.640] just
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:34.900] one
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.360] example.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:35.960] And
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.360] the
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:36.680] lesson
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.120] there
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.940] is
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.200] be
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.640] careful
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.000] when
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.140] you
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.360] look
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:39.520] at
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:39.820] data
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.180] because
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:40.620] it
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:40.860] can
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.280] really
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:41.700] easily
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.060] fool
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:42.480] you
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.420] because
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:43.640] there
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:43.760] are
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:43.960] all
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.260] kinds
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:44.480] of
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:44.720] funny
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.160] things
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.500] about
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:45.700] the
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:45.840] way
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.080] it's
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.500] collected,
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.500] about
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.020] these
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.880] artifactual
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.300] things
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:49.620] like
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.060] 300
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.380]-year
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:50.580]-old
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.080] patients,
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:51.760] and
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.000] so
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.180] on.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:53.940] OK,
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.540] so
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:54.880] here's
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.040] a
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.400] catalog
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.000] of
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.220] the
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.520] types
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:56.740] of
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.020] data
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.300] that
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:57.440] are
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:57.840] available
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.200] to
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:58.440] us.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.440] So
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:08:59.640] we
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:08:59.980] have
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.140] typical
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.540] kind
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:01.760] of
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.140] electronic

[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:02.980] record
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.360] data
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:03.640] from

[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:06.840] age,
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.060] sex,
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:07.880] socioeconomic
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.340] status,
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.360] insurance
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:09.780] type,
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.140] language,
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:10.640] religion,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:10.960] living
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.580] situation,

[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.560] structure,
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.200] location,
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:13.760] work,
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.320] et
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:14.600] cetera.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:15.840] We
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.040] have
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.320] vital
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.820] signs,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.240] your
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.560] weight,
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:17.780] your
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.080] height,
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.300] your
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:18.720] pulse,
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.420] respiration
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:19.820] rate,
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.140] body
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:20.720] temperature,
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:21.420] et
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:21.720] cetera.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:22.520] So
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:22.780] these
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:22.960] are
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.380] typically
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:23.700] the
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.020] things
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.360] that
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.940] if
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.180] you
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:25.560] ever
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:25.740] go
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:25.880] to
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.040] a
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.520] doctor's
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:26.800] office
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.240] or
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:27.620] you
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:27.840] go
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.060] into
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.280] a
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:28.700] hospital,
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:29.600] a
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:29.800] nurse
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.040] will
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.340] take
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:30.520] you
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:30.920] aside
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.220] and
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:31.740] weigh
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:31.980] you
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.180] and
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:32.460] measure
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:32.720] your
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.040] height
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.380] and
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.500] check
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:34.720] your
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:34.920] blood
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.320] pressure
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.760] and
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.100] take
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.280] your
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:37.740] temperature
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.100] and
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.360] stuff
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:38.580] like
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:38.820] that.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.120] These
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.320] are
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.020] standard
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.360] vital
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.800] signs.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.080] And
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.220] so
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:41.420] we
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:41.700] have
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.280] lots
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:42.460] of
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:42.700] those
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.240] recorded.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.720] Medications,
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.400] prescription
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.160] medications,
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.140] over
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:48.340]-the
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:48.580]-counter
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.160] drugs,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.660] illegal
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.200] drugs
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:50.460] if
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:50.680] you're
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:50.880] willing
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.180] not
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.380] to
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:51.660] lie
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:51.880] to
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.140] your

[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.560] alcohol.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.420] Again,
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:56.960] one
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.040] of
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.240] my
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.540] earliest
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.100] days,
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:58.860] I
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.060] was
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.360] hanging
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:09:59.660] out
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:09:59.880] with
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.060] a
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.800] cardiologist
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.340] at
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.580] Tufts
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:02.920] Medical
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.320] Center.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:03.860] And
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.520] we
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:04.840] see
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.220] this
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:05.580] elderly
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.020] lady
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.020] who
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.700] looks
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:08.980] kind
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:09.080] of
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.480] terrible.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:10.500] And
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.580] we're
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:11.960] talking
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.280] to
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:12.460] her.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.160] Well,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.540] the
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:13.940] doctor
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.140] is
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:14.440] talking
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:14.720] to
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:14.840] her.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.080] I'm
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.320] trying
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:15.580] to
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:15.800] stay
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.000] out
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.080] of
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.180] the
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.360] way.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:17.300] And
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.740] he
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.120] says,
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.960] so
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.520] do
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:22.660] you
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:22.920] drink
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.300] alcohol?
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.580] And
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:24.760] she
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.040] says,
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.220] oh,
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:25.420] no,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:25.720] never
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.040] touch
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.240] the
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:26.520] stuff.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:27.140] And
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.080] then
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.300] we
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:28.580] talk
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:28.840] some
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.140] more.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:29.400] And
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:29.580] we
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:29.760] go
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:29.960] out

[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:31.780] room.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.520] And
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.000] the
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.280] doctor
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:35.680] turns
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:35.920] to

[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.280] of
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:37.440] the
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:37.740] patient
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:38.540] and
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:38.840] says,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.000] oh,
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.360] she's
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:39.520] a
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:39.800] chronic
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.220] drunk.
[00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.670] I
[00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.850] said,
[00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.030] well,
[00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.190] how
[00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.270] do
[00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:42.390] you
[00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:42.630] know?
[00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.490] And
[00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.670] he
[00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.910] says,
[00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:44.210] well,
[00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:44.870] from
[00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.190] lab
[00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.630] tests,
[00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.930] from
[00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:46.150] the
[00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.530] appearance
[00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:46.790] of

[00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:47.310] skin,
[00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:47.670] from
[00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.890] her
[00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:48.230] general
[00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.790] demeanor,
[00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:50.630] from
[00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.190] various
[00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.850] sort
[00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.030] of
[00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.610] ineffable
[00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.230] factors.
[00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:53.890] And
[00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:54.090] so
[00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:54.530] patients
[00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.950] lie.
[00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.470] They
[00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.750] really
[00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.030] do,
[00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:58.530] because
[00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:58.730] they
[00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:58.850] don't
[00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.990] want
[00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.090] to
[00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.250] tell
[00:10:59.250 --> 00:10:59.390] you
[00:10:59.390 --> 00:10:59.730] things.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:02.240] OK.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:03.620] Medications,
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:03.920] by
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.020] the
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.180] way,
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:04.340] is
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:04.480] a
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:04.640] big
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:04.980] deal.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:05.460] So
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.220] there's
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:06.400] this
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:06.640] whole
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.060] field
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:07.500] called

[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.580] Medication
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.140] Reconciliation,
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.020] which
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:12.260] is
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:12.600] the
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.320] hospitals
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:13.560] or
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:13.780] the
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.280] doctor's
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:14.860] office's
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.300] attempt
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:15.960] to
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.220] figure
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.520] out
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:16.780] what

[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.080] actually
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.540] taking.
[00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:19.550] So
[00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.970] I'm
[00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:20.150] a

[00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:21.930] And
[00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.110] if
[00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.270] I
[00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:22.670] sign

[00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.250] it
[00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.610] tells
[00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:25.890] me
[00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.210] that
[00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:26.630] I'm

[00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.270] I
[00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:29.610] got
[00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.350] 12
[00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.670] years
[00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.090] ago
[00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.270] as
[00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.630] part
[00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.810] of
[00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:33.250] a
[00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:33.790] laboratory
[00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.570] test,
[00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:36.610] where
[00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.090] I
[00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:37.330] took
[00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:37.630] two
[00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.050] pills
[00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:38.830] which
[00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:39.090] were
[00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:39.370] supposed
[00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:39.630] to
[00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:39.810] have
[00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.090] some
[00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:40.510] physiological
[00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.270] effect.
[00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.510] And
[00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:41.650] then
[00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:41.830] they
[00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:42.150] measured
[00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.490] that.
[00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:42.730] And
[00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.490] I've
[00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.710] never
[00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.130] gotten
[00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:44.570] another
[00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:44.910] pill
[00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.150] and
[00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.390] never
[00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:45.750] taken
[00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.110] one
[00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.550] since
[00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.910] then,
[00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:47.570] nor
[00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:47.790] would
[00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.910] it
[00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.150] be
[00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.630] particularly
[00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.070] good
[00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:49.310] for
[00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.550] me.
[00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.490] But
[00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:50.710] it's
[00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.870] still
[00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:51.070] on
[00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:51.250] my
[00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:51.570] record.
[00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:52.330] And
[00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:52.670] there's
[00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.010] no
[00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:53.630] notice
[00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.870] of
[00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:54.010] it
[00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.290] ever
[00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:54.590] having
[00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.830] been
[00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.570] discontinued.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:56.840] And
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.060] that's
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.180] a
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:57.340] real
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:57.840] problem,
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.400] because
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:58.920] if
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.140] you're
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:11:59.400] taking
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:11:59.700] care
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:11:59.820] of
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:11:59.980] a
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.260] patient,
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.040] you'd
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.240] like
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:01.440] to
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:01.940] understand
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.280] what
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.580] drugs
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:02.780] they're
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.120] actually
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.560] taking.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:04.900] And
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.100] it's
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.280] hard
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.460] to
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:05.700] know.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:07.600] OK,
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:07.980] then
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.300] lab
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:08.720] tests.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.060] So
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:09.360] this
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:09.600] is
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.160] the
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.460] things
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:10.780] that
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.240] you
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.140] imagine
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.260] that
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:13.500] we
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:13.700] do
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:13.880] a
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.040] lot
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.280] of.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.000] And
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.240] these
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.380] are
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:15.940] components
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.300] of
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:16.520] the
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:16.780] blood
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.000] and
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.160] the
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.460] urine
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:17.960] mainly,
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:18.760] but
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.160] also
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:19.380] of
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:19.540] the
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:19.820] stool,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.400] saliva,
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:20.900] spinal
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.480] fluid,
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.800] fluid
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.260] taken
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:23.520] off
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:23.740] the
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.020] belly,
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:24.940] joint
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:25.360] fluid,
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.240] bone
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.640] marrow,
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.980] stuff
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:28.360] coming
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:28.580] out
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:28.720] of
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:28.920] your
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.320] lungs.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.080] It's
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.760] anything,
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.360] right?
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.120] And
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.400] any
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:32.760] place
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.120] where
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.480] you
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:33.680] can
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.180] produce
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.040] some
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.020] specimen,
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:36.280] they
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:36.980] can
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:37.300] send
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:37.440] it
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:37.600] to
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:37.800] a
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.000] lab
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.200] and
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:38.460] measure
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:38.840] things
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.000] in
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.120] it.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.520] And
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:39.680] they
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:39.960] measure
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.280] lots
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.440] and
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:40.640] lots
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:40.820] of
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.140] different
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:41.480] kinds
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:41.620] of
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:41.960] things.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:42.620] And
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:42.820] these
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:42.960] are
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.240] often
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:43.740] useful.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.480] Pathology,
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:46.400] qualitative
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:46.760] and
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.160] quantitative
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.020] examination
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:48.880] of
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.160] any
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:49.420] body
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.800] tissue,
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.120] for
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.500] example,
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.200] biopsy
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.660] samples
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.020] or
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:52.440] surgical
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.080] scraps.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:55.800] If
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.260] they
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:56.440] do
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:56.620] an
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.120] operation,
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:57.480] they
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:57.740] cut
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.100] something
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:58.400] out
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:58.540] of
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:58.740] you.
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:12:59.400] That
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:12:59.840] typically
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.260] winds
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:00.520] up
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:00.680] on
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:00.800] a
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.560] pathologist's
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:01.880] bench,
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.100] who
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.300] then
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:02.600] tries
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:02.840] to
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.040] figure
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.380] out
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:03.940] what
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.160] its
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:04.720] characteristics
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.180] are.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:05.340] And
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:05.640] that's,
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:05.880] again,
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.320] useful
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:06.940] information.
[00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:09.930] OK,
[00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.610] microbiology.
[00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.330] Ever
[00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:12.670] since
[00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.270] Pasteur,
[00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:13.490] we
[00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.730] know
[00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:13.950] that
[00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:14.410] organisms
[00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:14.950] cause
[00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:15.490] disease.
[00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:16.930] And
[00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.750] so
[00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.830] we
[00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:18.990] are
[00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.410] quite
[00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:19.830] interested
[00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.150] in
[00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.390] knowing
[00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:20.690] what
[00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.190] organisms
[00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:22.110] are
[00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.530] growing
[00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.030] inside
[00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.290] your
[00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:23.630] body.
[00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.470] And
[00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.150] typically,
[00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:27.930] testing
[00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:28.250] is
[00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.490] not
[00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.710] only
[00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.930] to
[00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.410] identify
[00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:29.730] the
[00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.150] organism,
[00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.970] but
[00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:31.230] also
[00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.510] to
[00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:31.730] figure
[00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.990] out
[00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.250] which
[00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:32.970] antibiotics
[00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:33.370] it's
[00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:33.790] sensitive
[00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.130] to
[00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:34.790] and
[00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:35.390] insensitive
[00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:35.770] to.
[00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:36.430] And
[00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.630] so
[00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:36.890] you'll
[00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:37.170] see
[00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:37.570] things
[00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:37.990] like
[00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.170] reports
[00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.790] of
[00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.350] sensitivity
[00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.110] testing
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.130] at
[00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:42.570] various
[00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:43.270] dilutions.
[00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:44.410] In
[00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:44.610] other
[00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:44.910] words,
[00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:45.590] they
[00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.850] try
[00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:46.030] to
[00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.450] give
[00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:46.610] a
[00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.950] strong
[00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:47.250] dose
[00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:47.430] of
[00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.570] an
[00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.210] antibiotic,
[00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.890] a
[00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:49.110] weaker
[00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.530] dose,
[00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.730] a
[00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.930] weaker
[00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:50.270] dose,
[00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.490] a
[00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:50.690] weaker
[00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.030] dose,
[00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.210] a
[00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:51.390] weaker
[00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:51.830] dose,
[00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.410] to
[00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:52.730] see
[00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.010] which
[00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:53.190] is
[00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:53.430] the
[00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.690] minimum
[00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.210] level
[00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:54.630] of
[00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.130] dosing
[00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:55.850] that's
[00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.090] enough
[00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.290] to
[00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.510] kill
[00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:56.830] the
[00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.310] bacteria.
[00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.430] There's
[00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.570] a
[00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:58.830] comma
[00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.230] missing
[00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.510] there.
[00:13:59.510 --> 00:13:59.730] But
[00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:00.410] input
[00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:00.830]-output
[00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:01.030] of
[00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.370] fluids
[00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.750] is
[00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.070] another
[00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:02.610] important
[00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.090] thing,
[00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:04.970] because
[00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:05.550] people,
[00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:06.210] especially
[00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:06.510] in
[00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:06.630] the
[00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.030] hospital,
[00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.370] often
[00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:08.790] get
[00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.170] either
[00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.990] dehydrated
[00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.490] or
[00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.490] overhydrated.
[00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:12.170] And
[00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.390] neither
[00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:12.690] of
[00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:12.910] those
[00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.090] is
[00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:13.270] good
[00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:13.550] for
[00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.770] you.
[00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.950] And
[00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.150] so
[00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.450] trying
[00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:14.650] to
[00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:14.870] keep
[00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:15.290] track
[00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.930] of
[00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:16.190] what's
[00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.430] going
[00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.730] into
[00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.930] you
[00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:17.070] and
[00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:17.310] what's
[00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.550] coming
[00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:17.810] out
[00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.950] of
[00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.070] you
[00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:18.250] is
[00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:18.710] important.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.220] Then
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:21.380] there
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:21.520] are
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:21.760] tons
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.000] of
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.380] notes.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.100] So
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.500] an
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:24.920] important
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.340] one
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:25.540] that
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:25.780] we're
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:25.880] going
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:25.980] to
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.140] look
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:26.340] at
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:26.460] in
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:26.640] this
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:26.960] class
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.160] is
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:27.580] discharge
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.120] summaries.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:28.840] So
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.220] these
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:29.400] are
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:29.640] the
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.020] typically
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.620] long
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.140] notes
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:31.880] that
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.040] are
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.320] written
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:32.700] at
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:32.840] the
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.040] end
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.160] of
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:33.260] a
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.140] hospitalization.
[00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:35.570] So
[00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:35.810] this
[00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:35.970] is
[00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:36.170] a
[00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:36.490] summary
[00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.570] of
[00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:38.310] why
[00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.510] you
[00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:38.810] came
[00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:39.190] in,
[00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.850] what
[00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:40.070] they
[00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:40.330] did
[00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:40.570] to
[00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:40.970] you,
[00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:41.850] the
[00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.530] main
[00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.110] things
[00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.330] they
[00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:43.810] discovered
[00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:44.250] about
[00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:44.630] you,
[00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.670] and
[00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.930] then
[00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:46.430] plans
[00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.730] for
[00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.950] what
[00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.150] to
[00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.310] do
[00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.630] after
[00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:47.890] your
[00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.370] discharge.
[00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:48.690] Where
[00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:48.830] are
[00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:48.890] you
[00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:49.030] going
[00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.150] to
[00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.430] go?
[00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:50.490] What
[00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:50.830] drugs
[00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:50.990] are
[00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.090] you
[00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:51.230] going
[00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.270] to
[00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:51.430] be
[00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.750] taking?
[00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:52.490] When
[00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:52.610] are
[00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.750] you
[00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:52.950] supposed
[00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:53.190] to
[00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:53.390] come
[00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:53.650] back
[00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:53.850] for
[00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:54.210] follow
[00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:54.430]-up,
[00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:54.630] et
[00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:54.890] cetera?
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.670] I'll
[00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.950] show
[00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:56.170] you
[00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:56.510] an
[00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.590] excruciatingly
[00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.870] long
[00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:58.110] one
[00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.270] of
[00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:58.590] those
[00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.150] later
[00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.390] in
[00:14:59.390 --> 00:14:59.930] the
[00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:00.190] lecture
[00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:00.630] today.
[00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:01.750] But
[00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.950] we
[00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:02.210] also
[00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.530] have
[00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:02.850] notes
[00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.130] from
[00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:03.710] attendings
[00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.910] of
[00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.070] our
[00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:04.430] residents,
[00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:05.170] nurses,
[00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.230] various
[00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.130] specialties,
[00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.270] consultants,
[00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.190] the
[00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:09.570] referring
[00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:10.070] physician.
[00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:10.370] If
[00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.670] somebody
[00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:11.130] sends
[00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:11.350] you
[00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.570] to
[00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:11.750] the
[00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.210] hospital,
[00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:13.130] that
[00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:13.510] doctor
[00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:13.830] will
[00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:14.250] usually
[00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:14.610] write
[00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:14.770] a
[00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:15.010] note
[00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:15.510] saying,
[00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:15.950] this
[00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:16.130] is
[00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:16.310] what
[00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.510] I'm
[00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:16.890] interested
[00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:17.170] in.
[00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:17.510] Here's
[00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:17.770] why
[00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.350] I'm
[00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.670] sending
[00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.890] in
[00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:19.030] the
[00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.350] patient.
[00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:20.390] There
[00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:20.490] are
[00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:20.750] letters
[00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.210] back
[00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:21.490] to
[00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:21.730] the
[00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.130] referring
[00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:22.630] physician
[00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.190] saying,
[00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:23.450] OK,
[00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:24.230] this
[00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.390] is
[00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:24.590] what
[00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.770] we
[00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:25.070] found
[00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:25.390] out.
[00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:25.770] Here's
[00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:25.930] the
[00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:26.230] answer
[00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.790] to
[00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.950] the
[00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:27.250] question
[00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:27.470] you
[00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.630] were
[00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.030] asking.
[00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.970] There
[00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.070] are
[00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:29.550] emergency
[00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.170] department
[00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.710] notes.
[00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:30.970] So
[00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:31.270] that's
[00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:31.570] often
[00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:31.770] the
[00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.030] first
[00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.670] contact
[00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.550] between
[00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.910] the
[00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:34.250] patient
[00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.610] and
[00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.770] the
[00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:34.950] health
[00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:35.130] care
[00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:35.530] system.
[00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.470] So
[00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.710] these
[00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.870] are
[00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.070] all
[00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:37.530] important.
[00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:38.790] And
[00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.090] then
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.060] there's
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.320] tons
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:41.580] and
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:41.800] tons
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.060] of
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.300] billing
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:42.680] data.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:43.480] So
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:43.920] remember,
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:44.960] the
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.660] EHR
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.220] systems
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.260] were
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.500] initially
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.160] designed
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.600] by
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.360] accountants.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.200] And
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:51.900] they
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.100] were
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.520] designed
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:52.760] for
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:52.940] the
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.260] purpose
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:53.500] of
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:53.740] billing.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:54.700] And
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:54.960] so
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.200] we
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:55.620] capture
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:55.920] a
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.120] lot
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:56.280] of
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:56.620] data
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.500] about
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.340] formalized
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:58.720] ways
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.000] of
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.540] describing
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.360] the
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:00.740] condition
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:00.960] of
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.140] the
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:01.460] patient
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:01.780] and
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:01.960] what
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.200] was
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.400] done
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:02.580] to
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:02.760] the
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.180] patient
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.260] in
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:04.460] order
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:04.780] to
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.420] submit
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:05.660] the
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:05.900] right
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.260] bills.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.720] You
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.320] obviously
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:09.660] want
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:09.780] to
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.000] bill
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.260] for
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:10.520] as
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:10.960] much
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.160] as
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.620] possible.
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.440] But
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:12.620] you
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:12.780] have
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:12.920] to
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.060] be
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:13.220] able
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:13.440] to
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:13.880] justify
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.180] the
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:14.440] bills
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:14.720] that
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:14.900] you
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.340] submit,
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.320] because
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.100] insurance
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.660] companies
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.000] and
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.500] Medicare
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:18.740] and
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.640] Medicaid
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.080] don't
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.260] have
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:21.380] a
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:21.540] good
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:21.820] sense
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:21.980] of
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.260] humor.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.060] And
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.720] if
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:23.920] you
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.280] submit
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.660] bills
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:24.960] for
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.240] things
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:25.480] that
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:25.640] you
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:25.980] can't
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.440] justify,
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.220] then
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:27.340] you
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:27.540] get
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.160] penalized.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:31.820] And
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.060] then
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:32.260] there
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:32.420] are
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:32.940] administrative
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.560] data
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:33.960] like,
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.500] which
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:34.980] service
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:35.220] are
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:35.400] you
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:35.660] on?
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.300] So
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:36.580] this
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.100] is
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.060] occasionally
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.420] a
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:38.840] confusing
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.340] thing.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:40.520] You
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:40.740] can
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:40.980] go
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:41.160] into
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.380] the
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:41.720] hospital
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.320] and
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:42.660] have
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:42.920] heart
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.440] problems.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.180] But
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:44.340] it
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:44.600] turns
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:44.860] out
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.120] that
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.520] the
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:45.840] heart
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.380] intensive
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:46.720] care
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.000] unit,
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.240] the
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:47.620] cardiac
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.120] intensive
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.440] care
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:48.760] unit,
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.400] is
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:49.660] full
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:49.940] up
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.280] with
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:50.820] patients.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:51.620] But
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:51.900] there's
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.040] an
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.340] extra
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:52.740] bed
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.140] in
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:53.720] the
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.300] pulmonary
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:54.920] intensive
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.240] care
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:55.580] unit.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:56.260] And
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:56.440] so
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:56.660] they
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:56.960] stick
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.180] you
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:57.320] in
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:57.600] that
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.120] unit.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:58.900] But
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.160] you're
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:16:59.440] still
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:16:59.680] on
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:16:59.860] the
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.480] cardiology
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.040] service.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:01.460] And
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:01.660] so
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:01.900] there
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.060] are
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:02.340] these
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:02.980] sort
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.100] of
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.480] mixture
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.040] kinds
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.240] of
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.600] cases
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:04.980] that
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:05.140] you
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:05.360] still
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:05.580] have
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:05.720] to
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:05.940] take
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:06.180] care
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:06.380] of.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.360] Transfers
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:07.660] are
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:07.920] when
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.040] you
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:08.220] get
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:08.700] transferred
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.100] from
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.320] one
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:09.560] place
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:09.740] to
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.020] another
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.280] in
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.420] the
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:10.820] hospital.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.460] Imaging
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:13.900] data.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:14.680] So
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.400] I'm
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:15.580] not
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:15.720] going
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:15.820] to
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:16.060] talk
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:16.320] about
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:16.540] that
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:16.880] much
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.320] today.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.120] But
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:18.360] there
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:18.500] are
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:18.740] x
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:18.940]-rays,
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:19.700] ultrasound,
[00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:21.290] CT,
[00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:21.830] MRI,
[00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.370] PET
[00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.790] scans,
[00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:23.930] retinal
[00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.430] scans,
[00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:25.430] endoscopy,
[00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:26.470] photographs
[00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.790] of
[00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:27.170] your
[00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:27.650] skin
[00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.910] and
[00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:28.150] stuff
[00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.370] like
[00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.670] that.
[00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.890] So
[00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:29.130] this
[00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:29.350] is
[00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.950] all
[00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:30.330] imaging
[00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:30.710] data.
[00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:31.450] And
[00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:31.730] there's
[00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.890] been
[00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:32.050] a
[00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:32.390] tremendous
[00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.790] amount
[00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:32.990] of
[00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.450] progress
[00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:34.050] recently
[00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:34.830] in
[00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:35.230] applying
[00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.630] machine
[00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.950] learning
[00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:36.350] techniques
[00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.750] to
[00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.950] try
[00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:37.130] to
[00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.590] interpret
[00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.250] the
[00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:38.690] contents
[00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.950] of
[00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:39.170] these
[00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:39.450] data.
[00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:39.670] So
[00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:39.930] these
[00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:40.090] are
[00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:40.330] also
[00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:40.650] very
[00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:41.110] important.
[00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.770] And
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.900] then
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.060] there's
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:44.180] the
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:44.400] whole
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.040] quantified
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:45.460] self
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:45.960]-movement.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:47.560] How
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:47.820] many
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:47.980] of
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.140] you
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.400] wear
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:48.740] an
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.860] activity
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.300] tracker?
[00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.110] Only
[00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.390] about
[00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.570] a
[00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.790] third?
[00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.890] I'm
[00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:55.410] surprised
[00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:55.690] at
[00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:55.930] a
[00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:56.150] place
[00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.410] like
[00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:56.810] MIT.
[00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.150] So
[00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.790] we
[00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.230] measure
[00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.590] steps
[00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.770] and
[00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:02.170] elevation
[00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:02.710] change
[00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.870] and
[00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:03.350] workouts.
[00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:03.730] And
[00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:04.290] you
[00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:04.470] can
[00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.850] record
[00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:05.230] vital
[00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.810] signs
[00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:06.610] and
[00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:07.870] diet
[00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:08.470] and
[00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.950] your
[00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:09.210] blood
[00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:09.630] sugar,
[00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.350] especially
[00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.730] if
[00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.890] you're
[00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.370] diabetic,
[00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:12.750] allergies,
[00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.830] allergic
[00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.730] incidents.
[00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.070] There's
[00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.430] all
[00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.630] this
[00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.270] mindfulness,
[00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:19.010] mood,
[00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:19.410] sleep,
[00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:19.910] pain,
[00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.850] sexual
[00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.450] activity.
[00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.370] And
[00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.590] then
[00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.050] people
[00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:23.310] have
[00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.730] developed
[00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.050] this
[00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:24.450] idea
[00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:24.690] of
[00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:24.870] N
[00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.990] of
[00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.190] 1
[00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.990] experiments,
[00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.890] where,
[00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.570] for
[00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:27.930] example,
[00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:28.170] I
[00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:28.390] had
[00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.550] a
[00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:28.810] student
[00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:29.490] some
[00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:29.770] years
[00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:30.090] ago
[00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.710] who
[00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:31.210] suffered
[00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:31.590] from
[00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.390] psoriasis.
[00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:33.750] It's
[00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:34.050] a
[00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.010] proteic
[00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:35.390] condition
[00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.630] of
[00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.830] the
[00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:36.110] skin.
[00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:36.870] And
[00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.050] the
[00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:37.310] problem
[00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.570] is
[00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:37.730] there
[00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:37.830] are
[00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.970] no
[00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:38.230] good
[00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.570] cures
[00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.910] for
[00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:39.090] it.
[00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.290] And
[00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:39.570] so
[00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.050] people
[00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:40.310] who
[00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.570] suffer
[00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:40.930] from
[00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:41.650] psoriasis
[00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:42.410] try
[00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:42.710] all
[00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:43.030] kinds
[00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:43.190] of
[00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.550] things.
[00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.250] They
[00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:44.790] stop
[00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.070] eating
[00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.450] nuts
[00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:45.690] for
[00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:45.870] a
[00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.130] while,
[00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.350] or
[00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.630] they
[00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.650] douse
[00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:48.130] themselves
[00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:48.550] with
[00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:48.910] vinegar,
[00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.310] or
[00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.530] they
[00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:49.870] do
[00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.010] whatever
[00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:51.570] crazy
[00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:51.890] thing
[00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:52.190] comes
[00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.370] to
[00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.650] mind.
[00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.330] And
[00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:54.730] we
[00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:55.030] don't
[00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.270] have
[00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.410] a
[00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:55.570] good
[00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:55.950] theory
[00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:56.270] for
[00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.450] how
[00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.610] to
[00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:56.810] treat
[00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:57.090] this
[00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:57.470] disease.
[00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.170] But
[00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:58.310] on
[00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.430] the
[00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.610] other
[00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.870] hand,
[00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.210] some
[00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.490] things
[00:18:59.490 --> 00:18:59.770] work
[00:18:59.770 --> 00:18:59.970] for
[00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:00.190] some
[00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.570] people.
[00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:01.330] And
[00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:01.530] so
[00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:01.810] there's
[00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:01.930] a
[00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:02.190] whole
[00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.770] methodology
[00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:03.410] that
[00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:03.590] has
[00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.770] been
[00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:04.150] developed
[00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.490] that
[00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.750] says,
[00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:04.990] when
[00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.130] you
[00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:05.390] try
[00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.670] these
[00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.070] things,
[00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:07.050] act
[00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:07.290] like
[00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:07.470] a
[00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.990] scientist.
[00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.510] Have
[00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.670] hypotheses.
[00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.590] Take
[00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.870] good
[00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:11.230] notes.
[00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.630] Collect
[00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.990] good
[00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.370] data.
[00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.790] Be
[00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:15.430] cognizant
[00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.670] of
[00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:15.950] things
[00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:16.270] like
[00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.710] onset
[00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:17.310] periods,
[00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:18.010] where
[00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.430] you
[00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.610] may
[00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:18.850] have
[00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:19.030] to
[00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:19.310] drip
[00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.770] vinegar
[00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.070] on
[00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.450] yourself
[00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.770] for
[00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:20.950] a
[00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:21.130] week
[00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:21.510] before
[00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.750] you
[00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.990] see
[00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.190] any
[00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.630] effect.
[00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.370] So
[00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:23.550] if
[00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:23.670] it
[00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:23.930] doesn't
[00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:24.110] do
[00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.430] anything
[00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.850] after
[00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:25.170] one
[00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.450] day,
[00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:25.830] don't
[00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:26.230] stop.
[00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.190] And
[00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.890] furthermore,
[00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.270] if
[00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.450] you
[00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:28.930] stop,
[00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:29.690] then
[00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:30.070] don't
[00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.410] start
[00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:30.850] something
[00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:31.330] new
[00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.050] immediately,
[00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:32.750] because
[00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.310] you
[00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.210] will
[00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:35.450] then
[00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.610] be
[00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:36.230] confused
[00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.670] about
[00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.390] whether
[00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.750] this
[00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.910] is
[00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:38.110] the
[00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.470] effect
[00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.670] of
[00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:38.810] the
[00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:38.990] thing
[00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.150] you
[00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:39.310] were
[00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.730] on
[00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:40.070] before
[00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.450] or
[00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:40.670] the
[00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:40.910] new
[00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:41.090] thing
[00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.290] that
[00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:41.450] you're
[00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.790] trying.
[00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.410] So
[00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:42.670] there's
[00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:42.850] all
[00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:43.130] sorts
[00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.310] of
[00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.650] ideas
[00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:43.990] like
[00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.230] that.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:45.660] OK.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:46.640] So
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:46.920] this
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.080] is
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:47.260] a
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:47.620] slide
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:47.960] from
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.220] our
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:48.660] paper
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.220] on
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:49.920] MIMIC3.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.000] And
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.280] it
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:51.560] gives
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:51.880] you
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.220] a
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:52.520] kind
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:52.660] of
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.240] overview
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.000] of
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.400] what's
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:54.640] going
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:54.920] on
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.100] with
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:55.240] the
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.560] patient.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.480] So
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:56.660] if
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:56.780] you
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:56.980] look
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.140] at
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:57.500] this,
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.280] I'm
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:19:59.360] going
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:19:59.460] to
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:19:59.720] point
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:19:59.940] with
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:00.200] my
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:00.600] hands.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:01.760] At
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:01.980] the
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.380] top
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:02.860] is
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.180] something
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:03.520] very
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.000] important.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.320] This
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:04.760] patient
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.280] starts
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:05.640] off
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.300] at
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:06.600] full
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.040] code.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:07.760] That
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.080] means
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.360] that
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:08.560] if
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.140] something
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:09.520] bad
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:09.940] happens
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.220] to
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:10.440] him,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.500] he
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:11.860] wants
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.480] everything
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:12.820] to
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:12.980] be
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.220] done
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:13.420] to
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:13.640] try
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:13.820] to
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.060] save
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.260] him.
[00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:15.570] And
[00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:15.750] he
[00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:16.050] winds
[00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:16.330] up
[00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:16.530] in
[00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:16.910] comfort
[00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:17.410] measures
[00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:17.830] only,
[00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:18.730] which
[00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:19.070] means
[00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.350] that
[00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.490] if
[00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.830] something
[00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.190] bad
[00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.590] happens
[00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.830] to
[00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.990] him,
[00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:21.130] he
[00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:21.370] wants
[00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:21.590] to
[00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.930] die,
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:23.540] or
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:23.760] his
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.100] family
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:24.500] does
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:24.800] if
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.460] he's
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.000] unconscious.
[00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:28.590] So
[00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.030] what
[00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:29.230] else
[00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.410] do
[00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:29.550] we
[00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:29.790] know
[00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.050] about
[00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:30.290] this
[00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:30.510] guy?
[00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.850] Well,
[00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:31.970] GCS
[00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:32.390] is
[00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.590] the
[00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.030] Glasgow
[00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:33.630] Coma
[00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:34.050] Score.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:34.930] And
[00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:35.350] it's
[00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.510] a
[00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.650] way
[00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:35.850] of
[00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:36.690] quantifying
[00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.750] people's
[00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:38.050] level
[00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:38.270] of
[00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.830] consciousness.
[00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.810] And
[00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:39.950] you
[00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:40.290] see
[00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:40.650] that
[00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.550] at
[00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:42.770] the
[00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:43.110] beginning,
[00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.570] this
[00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:43.930] patient
[00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:44.250] is
[00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:44.790] oriented
[00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.770] and
[00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.970] then
[00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:46.270] gets
[00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.970] confused
[00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:47.450] and
[00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.130] finally
[00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:48.390] is
[00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.710] only
[00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:49.170] making
[00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.130] incomprehensible
[00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:50.710] words
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:51.990] or
[00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.450] sounds.
[00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:54.450] Motor,
[00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:55.150] he's
[00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:55.390] able
[00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.650] to
[00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:55.970] obey
[00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:56.590] commands.
[00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:58.010] Eventually,
[00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.170] he's
[00:20:59.170 --> 00:20:59.630] only
[00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.990] able
[00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.470] to
[00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.450] flex
[00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:01.890] when
[00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:02.090] you
[00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.630] stimulate
[00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.930] his
[00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:03.250] muscles.
[00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:03.710] So
[00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:04.030] he's
[00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:04.230] no
[00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.610] longer
[00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.610] conscious.
[00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:07.490] High
[00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.030] movements,
[00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:09.370] he's
[00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:09.590] able
[00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.830] to
[00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:10.130] follow
[00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:10.410] you
[00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.090] spontaneously.
[00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:12.130] He's
[00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:12.350] able
[00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.590] to
[00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.890] orient
[00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:13.150] to
[00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:13.590] speech.
[00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.170] And
[00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:14.610] eventually,
[00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:14.950] no
[00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.410] orientation
[00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:15.870] at
[00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:16.050] all.
[00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:16.270] So
[00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:16.510] this
[00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:16.790] is
[00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:17.330] clearly
[00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.790] somebody
[00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:18.150] who's
[00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:18.430] going
[00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.870] downhill
[00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:19.950] quickly
[00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.750] and,
[00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.930] in
[00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:21.150] fact,
[00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:21.610] dies
[00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:21.950] at
[00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:22.110] the
[00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.270] end
[00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:22.410] of
[00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:22.630] this
[00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:23.390] episode.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.440] Now,
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.080] we
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:26.320] then
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:26.620] look
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:26.820] at
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:27.300] labs.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:27.840] So
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.040] we
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.200] can
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:28.620] see
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.680] what
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:29.820] is
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.020] their
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:30.280] level
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:30.540] of
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.100] platelets
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.380] about
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:31.960] the
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.220] time
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:32.420] that
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:32.600] they're
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.020] measured,
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:33.780] their
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.440] creatinine
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:34.820] level,
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.200] their
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:35.480] white
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:35.700] blood
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.000] cell
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.460] count,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:37.300] the
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:37.920] neutrophil
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.580] percentage,
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:38.840] et
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.140] cetera.
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:40.820] There's
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.040] not
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:41.440] every
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:41.960] possible
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.220] data
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:43.560] point
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:43.820] on
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:43.980] the
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.360] slide.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:44.660] This
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:44.780] is
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:45.040] just
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:45.560] illustrative.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.260] The
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:47.520] next
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:47.900] section
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:48.140] is
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:48.720] medications.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:49.660] So
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:49.840] the
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.120] person
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:50.380] is
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:50.580] on
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.120] morphine.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.120] They're
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.300] on
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.040] vancomycin,
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:53.320] which
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:53.480] is
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:53.620] an
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.260] antibiotic.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.280] Piperacillin,
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:56.440] I
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:56.580] don't
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:56.760] know
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:56.940] what
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.160] that
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:57.400] is.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.040] Somebody
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.320] know?
[00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:00.790] It's
[00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:00.950] what?
[00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:01.430] It's
[00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.490] an
[00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.730] antibiotic.
[00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:05.550] Sodium
[00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:05.970] chloride,
[00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.670] 9%,
[00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:07.030] so
[00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:07.330] that's
[00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:07.490] just
[00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.850] keeping
[00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:08.050] him
[00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:08.530] hydrated.
[00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:10.410] Amiodarone
[00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:10.650] and
[00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:11.250] dextrose,
[00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.570] so
[00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.090] dextrose
[00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:12.330] is
[00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.090] giving
[00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:13.290] him
[00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:13.530] some
[00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:13.910] energy.
[00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:14.650] And
[00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:14.850] then
[00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:15.230] these
[00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.490] are
[00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:15.730] the
[00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:16.070] various
[00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.670] measurements.
[00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:18.150] So
[00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:18.310] you
[00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.530] see
[00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:18.730] the
[00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:18.990] heart
[00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.290] rate,
[00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:19.510] for
[00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.990] example,
[00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.870] is
[00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:21.270] up
[00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.550] pretty
[00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:21.950] high
[00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:22.190] and
[00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.370] is
[00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.710] going
[00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:23.030] up
[00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:23.330] near
[00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.530] the
[00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:23.830] end.
[00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.510] The
[00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.910] oxygen
[00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:25.750] saturation
[00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:26.830] starts
[00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.170] off
[00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:27.470] pretty
[00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.870] good.
[00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.490] But
[00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.970] here,
[00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:29.510] we're
[00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.830] down
[00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.310] to
[00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.450] 60
[00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:31.810]%
[00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.150] or
[00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:32.490] 50
[00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.090]%
[00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:33.870] O2
[00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.250] sat,
[00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:34.550] which
[00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:34.730] is
[00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.010] supposed
[00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:35.190] to
[00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.350] be
[00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.650] above
[00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:36.010] about
[00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:36.570] 92
[00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:37.850] in
[00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:38.070] order
[00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.330] to
[00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.530] be
[00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:38.970] considered
[00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:39.430] reasonable.
[00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:40.390] So
[00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.910] again,
[00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.190] this
[00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.350] is
[00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.450] a
[00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:41.630] very
[00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.110] consistent
[00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.610] picture
[00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:42.950] of
[00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:43.190] things
[00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.530] going
[00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:43.890] very
[00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:44.230] badly
[00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.710] wrong
[00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:45.310] for
[00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.550] this
[00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:45.910] particular
[00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:46.450] patient.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.380] So
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:48.620] this
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:48.800] is
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.100] all
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:49.580] the
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.280] data
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:50.540] in
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:50.680] the
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.020] database.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.240] Now,
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:52.560] if
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:52.680] you
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:52.840] want
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:52.960] to
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.120] try
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.300] to
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:53.720] analyze
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.000] some
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.140] of
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:54.340] this
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:54.620] stuff,
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:54.780] you
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:54.980] can
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.240] say,
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:55.540] well,
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.540] let's
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:57.840] look
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.260] at
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:58.980] the
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.340] ages
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:22:59.620] at
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:22:59.780] the
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.080] time
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.240] of
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:00.400] the
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:00.740] last
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.040] lab
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.500] measurement
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.080] in
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.220] the
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:02.720] database.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:03.420] So
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:03.560] we
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:03.740] have
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:03.920] the
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.300] times
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:04.480] of
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:04.660] all
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:04.780] the
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.040] lab
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.560] measurements.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.400] So
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:06.580] we
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:06.740] can
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.160] see
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.080] that
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.600] many
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:08.860] of
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.060] the
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:09.460] ICU
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.280] population
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.160] are
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:11.500] fairly
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:11.920] old.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.600] There's
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.280] a
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:15.680] relatively
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.220] small
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:16.560] number
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:16.800] of
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.020] young
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.440] people
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.200] and
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:18.380] then
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:18.540] a
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:18.800] growing
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.160] number
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:19.440] of
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:19.680] older
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.120] people
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:20.700] in
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:21.160] both
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.480] females
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:22.800] and
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.140] males.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:23.900] If
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.560] we
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:24.900] look
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.500] at
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.220] age
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:27.360] at
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:27.760] admission
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.120] by
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.560] gender,
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:29.520] so
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:29.780] this
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:29.960] is
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.240] age
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:30.380] at
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:30.820] admission,
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.240] not
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.520] age
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:31.700] at
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:31.860] the
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.120] time
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:32.300] the
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:32.600] last
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:32.900] lab
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.280] measurement
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:33.640] was
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:33.940] done,
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.320] it's
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:35.400] a
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:35.540] pretty
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.080] similar
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.880] curve.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:37.400] So
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:37.580] we
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:37.860] see
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.620] that
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.780] females
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.460] were
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.240] 64
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.180].21
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:42.940] at
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.260] time
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:43.420] of
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:43.720] last
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.360] lab
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:45.840] measurement,
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:46.520] 63
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.420].5
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.160] at
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:48.360] the
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:48.620] time
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:48.800] of
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.200] admission.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:50.920] So
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.940] we
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.100] can
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.360] look
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:52.520] at
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.160] demographics.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.160] And
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.760] demographics
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.440] typically
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.240] includes
[00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:57.140] these
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:57.560] kinds
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:57.780] of
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.420] factors,
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:58.740] which
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:23:58.900] I
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.260] mentioned
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:23:59.740] before.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:00.720] And
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:00.980] again,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:01.180] if
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:01.380] we're
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:01.740] interested
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.020] in
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:02.160] the
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:02.720] relationship
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.300] between
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:03.760] this
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.340] and,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:04.520] for
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:04.860] example,
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.140] the
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:05.360] age
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.000] distribution,
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.020] we
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:07.300] see
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:07.780] that
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.120] if
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:09.420] you
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:09.700] look
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:09.980] at
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:10.200] the
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.600] different
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.580] admission
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.120] types,
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.080] so
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:13.260] you
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:13.460] can
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:13.840] be
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.360] either
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.180] admitted
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.760] for
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:16.960] an
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.500] emergency
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:18.440] for
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.000] some
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.380] urgent
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:19.900] care
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.580] or
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.220] electively.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:22.940] And
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:23.200] it
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:23.540] doesn't
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:23.800] seem
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.000] to
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.200] make
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:24.340] a
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:24.480] whole
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:24.720] lot
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:24.860] of
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.380] difference,
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.020] at
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:26.280] least
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:26.480] in
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:26.640] the
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.000] means
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.420] of
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:27.680] the
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.400] population
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.600] age
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.200] distribution.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.280] On
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:31.440] the
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:31.640] other
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:31.980] hand,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:32.460] if
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:32.620] you
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:32.940] look
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.320] at
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:33.960] insurance
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.440] type
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.560] and
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.000] say,
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.020] who's
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:37.300] paying
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:37.500] the
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:37.820] bills,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:38.940] there's
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.080] a
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.280] big
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:39.860] difference
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.220] in
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:40.380] the
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:40.620] age
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.280] distributions.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:42.400] Now,
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.560] why
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:44.700] do
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:44.880] you
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.140] think
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:45.520] that
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.200] private
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:46.920] insurance
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.540] drops
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.180] way
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:48.580] off
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:48.900] at
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:49.180] about
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:49.740] 65?
[00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.750] Isn't
[00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:52.270] insurance
[00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:52.890] always
[00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:53.290] covered
[00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:53.510] for
[00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.790] everyone
[00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.070] by
[00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.170] the
[00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:54.430] state?
[00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:56.330] It's
[00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.610] because
[00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:56.810] of
[00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:57.150] Medicare.
[00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.070] So
[00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.470] Medicare
[00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.110] covers
[00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.510] people
[00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.690] who
[00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.810] are

[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:07.420] It's
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:07.540] a
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:07.700] bit
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.060] cynical,
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:08.400] and
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:08.540] he
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:08.820] said,
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.180] suppose

[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:15.980] for
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.140] him?
[00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:19.440] Well,
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.220] there
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:20.300] are
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:20.660] standard

[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.200] you
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:21.380] should
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:21.600] do
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:21.800] for
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.200] somebody

[00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:31.130] But
[00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.370] his
[00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.710] cynical
[00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:32.130] answer
[00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:32.450] was
[00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:32.930] absolutely
[00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:33.530] nothing.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.340] Why?
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:37.420] Well,
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.600] it's
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:37.800] very
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.120] cheap
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:38.320] to
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:38.480] do
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:38.780] nothing.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:40.620] Most
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:40.960] people
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.180] who
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:41.600] develop
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:41.900] type
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.100] 2
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:42.580] diabetes
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.040] don't
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:43.260] get
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:43.580] real
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:43.900] sick
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:44.100] in

[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:44.640] two
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.000] years.
[00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:46.750] And
[00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.930] by
[00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.110] the
[00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.390] time
[00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.790] this
[00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:48.150] patient
[00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:48.410] is
[00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:48.910] 65,
[00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:49.790] he'll
[00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:49.950] be
[00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.150] the
[00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:50.650] government's
[00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:51.350] responsibility,
[00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.890] not
[00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:52.110] the
[00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.510] insurance
[00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.230] company's.
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:00.980] So
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:01.660] of
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:01.920] course,
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:02.260] a
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:02.420] lot
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:02.540] of
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:02.700] the
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.020] elderly
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:03.360] are
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:03.760] insured

[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.220] Medicaid.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.540] Not
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:06.800] that
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.340] surprising.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.220] Self
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.560]-pay
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:08.880] is
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.040] a
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:09.220] pretty
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:09.620] small
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.040] number
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.100] because
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.520] it's
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:11.980] insanely
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:12.600] expensive
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:12.980] to
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:13.160] pay
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:13.380] for
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:13.580] your

[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.100] health
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:14.360] care.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.020] So
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.980] what
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.200] about

[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.080] or
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.340] were
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:25.500] you
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:25.660] an

[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:26.800] admit,
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.280] or
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:27.540] were
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:27.920] you
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.720] referred

[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:42.660] it
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:42.900] doesn't
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.120] make
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:43.380] much
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:43.900] difference.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.380] The

[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:45.700] there
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:45.900] and

[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:47.620] look
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.240] moderately
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.760] similar.

[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.380] old
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.600] because
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:58.880] younger
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.240] people
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:26:59.680] don't

[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:03.340] sure
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:03.820] why
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.600] transfers
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.160] within
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.380] the
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:05.860] facility
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:06.860] are
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.840] significantly
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.400] younger
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:09.880] ages,
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.320] but
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:10.800] that's
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.080] true
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.260] from
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:12.480] the
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:12.720] MIMIC
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.020] data.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:15.780] What
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.060] about
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:16.360] age
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:16.820] at
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.300] admission
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:17.720] by
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.260] language?
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:18.960] So
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.280] some
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:19.560] people
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.000] speak
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.420] English.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.200] Some
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:21.960] people
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.420] speak
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:22.720] not
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.200] available.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.420] Some
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:25.780] people
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:26.220] speak
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:26.780] Spanish,
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.020] et
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:27.320] cetera.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:28.600] So
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:28.800] it
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:28.940] turns
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.140] out
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:29.340] the
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:29.700] Russians
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.540] are
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:30.720] the
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.120] oldest.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:33.800] And
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.280] that
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:34.480] may
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:34.720] have
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:34.880] to
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.040] do
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:35.240] with
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:35.760] immigration
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.340] patterns,
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:36.740] or
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.260] I
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:37.380] don't
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:37.580] know
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.020] exactly
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.500] why.
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.740] But
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.580] that's
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.400] what
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:43.620] the
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:43.820] data
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.180] show.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:45.940] If
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:46.060] you
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:46.220] do
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:46.360] it
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:46.580] by
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.100] ethnicity,
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:48.500] it
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:48.780] turns
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:49.120] out
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.660] that
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.220] African
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:51.720]-Americans
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.860] on
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.040] the
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:53.420] whole
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:53.920] are
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.340] somewhat
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:54.780] younger
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.120] than
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.540] whites,
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.320] and
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.020] Hispanics
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:57.280] are
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:57.640] somewhat
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.080] younger
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:58.460] yet.
[00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.530] So
[00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:01.770] that
[00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.070] means
[00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.450] that
[00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:03.430] those
[00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.170] subpopulations
[00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.330] apparently
[00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:06.890] need
[00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:07.630] intensive
[00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:08.110] care
[00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.910] earlier
[00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:09.270] in
[00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:09.610] life
[00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.070] than
[00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.050] whites.
[00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:11.850] So
[00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:12.110] this
[00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.350] is
[00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:13.090] a
[00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:13.410] topic
[00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:13.750] that's
[00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:14.050] very
[00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:14.730] hot
[00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:15.070] right
[00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.470] now,
[00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:16.250] discussions
[00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.790] about
[00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:17.290] how
[00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:18.110] bias
[00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.430] might
[00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.770] play
[00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:19.210] into
[00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:19.930] health
[00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:20.130] care.
[00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:20.370] Yeah?
[00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:20.930] What
[00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:21.170] is
[00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:21.890] unable
[00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:22.130] to
[00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.470] remain?
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:23.860] It
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:24.120] just
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:24.440] means
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:24.780] that
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.540] somebody
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.100] refused
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:26.380] to
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:26.620] say
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:26.900] what
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.100] their
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.520] ethnicity
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:27.980] was.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:30.960] I
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.560] think.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:31.880] I'm
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.080] not
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:32.540] positive.
[00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:34.210] So
[00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:34.770] just
[00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:35.010] to
[00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:35.430] confirm,
[00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:36.770] this
[00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:37.050] also
[00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:37.510] represents
[00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.450] Boston's
[00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:39.350] population
[00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.910] dynamics,
[00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:40.130] too,
[00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:40.370] right?
[00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.170] It's
[00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:41.330] the
[00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:41.850] catchment
[00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:42.230] basin
[00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.650] of
[00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:42.850] the
[00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:43.030] Beth
[00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.390] Israel
[00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:43.950] Deaconess
[00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:44.390] Hospital,
[00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.770] which
[00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:45.110] is
[00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.910] Boston,
[00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.410] clearly.
[00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.970] But
[00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.450] it
[00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.450] turns
[00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:49.730] out
[00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:50.090] that
[00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.050] a
[00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:51.210] lot
[00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:51.370] of
[00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:51.630] North
[00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.870] Shore
[00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:52.290] people
[00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:52.570] go
[00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:52.750] to
[00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.970] Mass
[00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:53.390] General,
[00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.190] and
[00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:54.790] so
[00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:55.190] different
[00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.690] hospitals
[00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:56.110] have
[00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.470] different
[00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.970] catchment
[00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.430] basins.
[00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.870] Does
[00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:58.070] it
[00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.350] have
[00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.590] anything
[00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.790] to
[00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:58.910] do
[00:28:58.910 --> 00:28:59.090] with,
[00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.510] is
[00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.670] this
[00:28:59.670 --> 00:28:59.850] just
[00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.010] the
[00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:00.350] ICU,
[00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:00.810] or
[00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:00.990] is
[00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.290] this
[00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.370] everybody
[00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:02.970] who
[00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:03.130] goes
[00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:03.210] to
[00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:03.310] the
[00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.670] hospital,
[00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.910] the
[00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:04.270] ER?
[00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:04.730] These
[00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:05.250] are
[00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:05.530] all
[00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:05.870] people
[00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:06.310] who,
[00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:06.630] at
[00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.910] some
[00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:07.250] point,
[00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:07.470] were
[00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.650] in
[00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:07.810] the
[00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:08.230] ICU.
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.100] So
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:10.380] these
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:10.540] are
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:10.760] the
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.140] sicker
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:11.640] patients.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:12.720] Yeah?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.500] So
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.000] just
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:15.100] so
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:15.220] much,
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:15.340] I
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:15.480] can
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:15.580] see
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:15.760] that
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:15.960] there
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.060] is
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:16.200] a
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.440] higher
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:16.980] portion
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.160] of
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:17.420] black
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:17.680] African
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:17.900]-American
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.240] people
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:18.500] in
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:18.760] the
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.240] population
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:19.500] here
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:19.720] as
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:19.940] well,
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.440] because
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.320] the
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:21.480] red
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:21.640] is
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:21.900] higher
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.100] than
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:22.240] the
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:22.540] others.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.260] No,
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:24.840] actually,
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.300] I
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:26.460] don't
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:26.840] remember
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.100] if
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.240] I
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:27.440] have
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:27.640] that
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:27.920] graph.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.100] I
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.280] think
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:28.520] this
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:28.700] is
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.200] cumulative.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.000] Oh,
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:30.420] OK.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:30.920] OK,
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:31.440] so
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.520] most
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.400] people
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.000] are
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.860] white,
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.240] for
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:38.540] whatever
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.520] definition
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:39.820] of
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.100] white
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:40.700] we're
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.060] using.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:41.840] And
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.000] I
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.180] think
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:42.400] it's
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:42.620] only
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.040] the
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.440] increment
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:43.860] that
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:43.980] you
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.220] see
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:44.440] on
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:44.740] top.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.200] All
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:49.800] right,
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:49.980] how
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:50.200] about
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:50.560] marital
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.120] status?
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:53.700] Well,
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.040] according
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.300] to
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:54.600] this,
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:54.840] it's
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.120] bad
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.340] to
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:55.520] be
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:55.900] single,
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:01.920] right?
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.020] All
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.020] right,
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.440] so
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:03.980] I
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.180] could
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.460] sort
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:04.580] of
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:04.760] see
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:04.980] that
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:05.180] for
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.000] hospitalization.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.280] I'm
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.460] not
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:06.640] sure
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:06.980] why
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.260] it's
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:07.480] true
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:07.680] for
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:07.880] the
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.300] ICU,
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:10.660] because
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.100] if
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.220] you
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:11.380] don't
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:11.580] have
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:11.880] anybody
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.420] at
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:12.740] home
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.360] to
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:13.600] take
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:13.840] care
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.000] of
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.140] you
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.320] when
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.440] you
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:14.640] get
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:14.980] sick,
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:15.620] it
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:15.840] seems
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.560] reasonable
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:16.980] that
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:17.160] you'd
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.280] be
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.500] more
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:17.780] likely
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.020] to
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:18.240] wind
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:18.420] up
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:18.560] in
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:18.680] the
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.020] hospital.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:19.280] But
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:19.420] I
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:19.540] don't
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:19.680] know
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:19.860] why
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:20.080] you'd
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:20.260] wind
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:20.440] up
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:20.600] in
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.000] intensive
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.320] care.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:21.640] Yeah?
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:22.320] Isn't
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:22.460] it
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:22.760] possible
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.040] that
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.320] those
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:23.420] are
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:23.760] also,
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:24.360] like,
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.100] single
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:25.360] people
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:25.540] are
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:26.400] probably
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:26.760] younger
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.280] than
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:27.780] married
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.140] people,
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:28.720] and
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.160] those
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.260] are
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:29.460] probably
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:29.700] younger
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.160] than
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:30.680] widowed
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:30.840] people?
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:31.100] Yes,
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.320] yeah.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:31.660] That's
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:31.940] probably
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:32.260] also
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:32.640] right.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:34.320] Yep.
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.000] OK,
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:39.600] so
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.520] here's
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:40.680] an
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.040] interesting
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:41.540] question,
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:41.760] a
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:41.900] little
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:42.080] bit
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.480] related
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:42.780] to
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.060] something
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:43.400] you'll
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:43.620] see
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:43.840] on
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.260] the
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:44.580] next
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:44.920] problem
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.280] set.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:46.980] So
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.380] could
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:47.640] we
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.240] predict
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:48.640] in
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.120]-hospital
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:49.760] mortality
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.820] from
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:51.160] just
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.360] these
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:51.880] demographic
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.380] features?
[00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:56.290] So
[00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:56.590] I'm
[00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.870] using
[00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:57.110] a
[00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.390] tool
[00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:57.910] in
[00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.630] language
[00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:00.010] called
[00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:00.350] R.
[00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:01.270] This
[00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:01.470] is
[00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.690] a
[00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:01.990] general
[00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.370] linear
[00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:02.810] model,
[00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:03.050] and
[00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:03.250] I've
[00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:03.450] set
[00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:03.570] it
[00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:03.730] up
[00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:03.890] to
[00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:04.090] do,
[00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.590] basically,
[00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.110] logistic
[00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.610] regression.
[00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:06.190] And
[00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.130] it
[00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:07.510] says,
[00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:08.030] I'm
[00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:08.490] predicting
[00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:08.910] whether
[00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:09.170] you
[00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:09.450] die
[00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:09.630] in
[00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:09.750] the
[00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:10.270] hospital
[00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.810] based
[00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:12.250] on
[00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:13.250] these
[00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.270] demographic
[00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:16.050] factors.
[00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:17.130] And
[00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:17.290] it
[00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:17.510] turns
[00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.810] out
[00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:18.110] that
[00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.690] the
[00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:19.070] only
[00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.430] ones
[00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.690] that
[00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:19.930] are
[00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:20.790] highly
[00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.430] significant
[00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.330] are
[00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:22.810] age,
[00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:24.090] so
[00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:24.370] that's
[00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:24.570] not
[00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.130] surprising
[00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.110] that
[00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:26.850] older
[00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:27.190] people
[00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.410] are
[00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:27.630] more
[00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:27.970] likely
[00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.250] to
[00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.490] die
[00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.730] than
[00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.990] younger
[00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.410] people.
[00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:30.090] It's
[00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:30.450] generally
[00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:30.870] true.
[00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.110] And
[00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:33.150] if
[00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:33.410] I'm
[00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:33.950] unable
[00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:34.470] to
[00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:35.110] obtain
[00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.350] your
[00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.830] ethnicity
[00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:36.410] or
[00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:36.670] I
[00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:36.950] don't
[00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:37.190] know
[00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.390] your
[00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:37.850] ethnicity,
[00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.150] then
[00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:39.350] you're
[00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.530] more
[00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:39.830] likely
[00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.110] to
[00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.350] die.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:42.740] I
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:42.880] have
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.180] no
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:43.500] clue
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.520] why
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:44.760] that
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:44.980] might
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.180] be
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:45.340] the
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:45.640] case.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.180] And
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:47.480] other
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:47.900] things
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.300] are
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:48.740] not
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:48.960] as
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.480] significant.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:49.940] So
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.120] if
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:50.280] you
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:50.540] speak
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:50.940] Spanish
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.180] or
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:51.560] English,
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:52.420] you're
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:52.800] slightly
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.180] less
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:53.560] likely
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:53.900] to
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.160] die.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.380] You
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:54.580] see
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:54.760] a
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.060] negative
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:55.680] contribution
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.320] here.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.180] And
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:57.360] if
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.180] you
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.520] speak
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:58.960] Russian,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:31:59.300] you're
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:31:59.680] slightly
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.040] less
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.380] likely
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:00.680] to
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.000] die.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:01.760] But
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.060] it's
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.000] significant,
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:03.500] not
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:03.700] at
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:03.880] the
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.080] p
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.300] equal
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:04.580] 0
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:04.920].05
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.480] level,
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:06.220] but
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:06.360] it
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:06.540] is
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:06.720] at
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:06.860] the
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.100] p
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:07.360] equal
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:07.620] 0
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.020].06
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.520] level.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:10.620] And
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:11.140] marriage
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:11.620] doesn't
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:11.920] seem
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.120] to
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:12.320] make
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:12.600] much
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.120] difference
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.560] in
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.740] predicting
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.100] whether
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:15.380] you're
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:15.520] going
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:15.600] to
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:15.820] die
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:15.980] or
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.240] not.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:17.340] Now,
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:17.720] remember,
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.060] this
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:18.260] is
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:18.680] ICU
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.420] patients,
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:20.920] and
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.160] we're
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:21.460] looking
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:21.700] at
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:21.920] in
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.340]-hospital
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:22.900] mortality,
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:23.220] yeah.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:24.760] For
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.280] ethnicity,
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.540] can
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:26.700] they
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:26.880] learn
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.040] that
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:27.160] at
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:27.360] any
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:27.560] point
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:27.800] during
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:27.960] the
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.180] stay
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:28.340] or
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:28.520] just
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:28.700] right
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:28.800] at
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:28.900] the
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.200] beginning?
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.680] Do
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.360] you
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:30.540] know?
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:30.800] Because
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:30.880] I
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.020] don't
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:31.200] know.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:31.400] I
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:31.600] don't
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:31.840] know.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:32.540] Because
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:32.820] it
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.000] could
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:33.180] be
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:33.460] that
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:34.400] unable
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:34.620] to
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.040] obtain
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:35.360] means
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:35.520] that
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:35.640] they
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:35.900] died
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.160] before
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:36.340] we
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:36.460] could
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:36.660] ask
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:36.820] them.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.120] No,
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:38.380] because
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.300] there
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:39.620] wouldn't
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:39.800] be
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.040] that
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.300] many
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:40.500] of
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:40.700] those
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.060] people,
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:41.280] I
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:41.540] think.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:43.800] There
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.280] are
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:44.440] not
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:44.680] that
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:44.880] many
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.240] people
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:45.900] who
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:46.240] don't
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:46.500] live
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:46.900] past
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.700] the
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.760] intake
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.240] interview.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:51.460] And
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:51.600] they
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:51.780] do
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.100] ask
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:52.300] them.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:55.620] Unless
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:55.780] they
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.000] found
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.240] it's
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:56.320] a
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:56.500] bad
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.640] shape
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:57.820] to
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.000] do
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.160] it.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:58.640] Yeah,
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:32:59.060] that
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:32:59.620] would
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:32:59.760] be
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:32:59.920] an
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.300] example.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:00.560] But
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:00.760] I
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:00.900] don't
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.140] think
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:01.380] you'd
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:01.620] see
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:01.980] enough
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.300] such
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:02.720] people
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:04.900] to
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:05.460] show
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:05.740] up
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.540] statistically.
[00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.230] OK,
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:11.720] well,
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.160] so
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:13.480] I've
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:13.740] already
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.200] mentioned
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:14.600] that
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:14.920] there's
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.140] this
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:15.620] problem
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.580] of
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:16.860] having
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:17.320] moved
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:17.740] from
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.160] CareVue
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:18.380] to
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:18.900] MetaVision
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.380] just
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:19.600] in
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:19.740] the
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:19.980] MIMIC
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.560] database.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.680] But
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:21.860] of
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.040] course,
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:22.300] this
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:22.460] is
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:22.600] a
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:22.760] much
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.040] bigger
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:23.520] problem
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.180] around
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:24.420] the
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:24.700] country
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:24.940] and
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:25.180] around
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:25.400] the
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:25.660] world,
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.160] because
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:26.860] every
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.260] hospital
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:27.640] has
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:27.820] its
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:28.040] own
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:28.240] way
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:28.400] of
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:28.640] keeping
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.120] records.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:29.720] And
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.400] wouldn't
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:30.580] it
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:30.760] be
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.180] nice
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:31.620] if
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:31.820] we
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:32.200] had
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:32.880] standards?
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.360] And
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:34.580] of
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:34.800] course,
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.180] there's
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:35.400] this
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:35.700] funny
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.260] phrase,
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:36.440] the
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:36.780] wonderful
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.100] thing
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:37.340] about
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:37.900] standards
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:38.620] is
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:38.800] that
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:38.940] there
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:39.020] are
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:39.180] so
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:39.400] many
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:39.620] to
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:39.880] choose
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.240] from.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:41.740] So
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:41.980] for
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.340] example,
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:42.620] if
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:42.740] you
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:42.960] look
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.140] at
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:43.740] prescriptions
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.340] in

[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:46.660] here
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:46.860] are

[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.440] And
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.180] so
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.800] they
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.000] have
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.200] the

[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:02.420] dates.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:03.640] One
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:03.860] is
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.220] a
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:04.640] prescription
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.360] for

[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:07.460] acetaminophen.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:08.360] And
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:08.560] the
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:08.780] other
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.100] is
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:09.380] for
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.140] clobetasol

[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:12.340]%
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:12.940] cream.
[00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:13.820] That's
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:14.040] a
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:14.520] skin
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.360] lotion
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.000] thing
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.380] for,
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.080] I
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.220] think
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:17.460] it's
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:17.620] a

[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:20.780] So
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.180] if
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:21.340] you
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:21.660] look

[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:32.660] thing
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:32.880] is

[00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:38.520] And
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:38.700] if
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:38.840] you
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.080] look,
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:39.960] there's
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.240] also

[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.340] milligrams,
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:34.720] the
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.040] dose
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:35.400] here
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.060] is
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:36.440] one
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.380] application,
[00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.710] whatever
[00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:39.070] that
[00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:39.330] is.
[00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:40.370] I
[00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.530] don't
[00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:40.710] know
[00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.910] what
[00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:41.070] the
[00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:41.290] 0
[00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:41.490].01
[00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:42.030] means.
[00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.830] And
[00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:43.050] this
[00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:43.210] is
[00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:43.390] a
[00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.710] tablet,
[00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:44.070] and
[00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:44.330] that's
[00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:44.490] a
[00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:44.850] tube.
[00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:45.650] And
[00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.990] this
[00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.150] is
[00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.510] taken
[00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.090] orally,
[00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:47.330] and
[00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:47.770] that's
[00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:48.370] administered
[00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:48.770] on
[00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.950] the
[00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:49.230] skin.
[00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:52.490] So
[00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:53.170] this
[00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:53.330] is
[00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:53.490] a
[00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:53.770] local
[00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:54.470] database.
[00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:55.430] For
[00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.650] a
[00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:55.850] doctor,
[00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:56.070] they
[00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:56.330] just
[00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:56.610] get
[00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:56.770] the
[00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.190] package.
[00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:00.630] At
[00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.050] most
[00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:01.610] hospitals,
[00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:02.150] that's
[00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.390] true
[00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.850] now.
[00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.430] It
[00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.830] wasn't
[00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:04.110] true
[00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:04.410] when
[00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:04.610] the
[00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:04.810] MIMIC
[00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:05.210] database
[00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.710] started
[00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:06.210] being
[00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.330] collected.
[00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.550] And
[00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.470] the
[00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.790] BI
[00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:10.190] was
[00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.710] relatively
[00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.250] late
[00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.070] in
[00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:12.350] moving
[00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:12.590] to
[00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:12.910] that
[00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:13.290] compared
[00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:13.590] to
[00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:13.810] some
[00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:13.930] of
[00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:14.030] the
[00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.230] other
[00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.710] hospitals
[00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.990] in
[00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.130] the
[00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:15.390] Boston
[00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.790] area.
[00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:16.730] Each
[00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:17.130] hospital
[00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:17.450] has
[00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.670] its
[00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.530] own
[00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:19.650] desiderata
[00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:19.930] for
[00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:20.190] what
[00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.350] it
[00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:20.610] thinks
[00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:20.790] is
[00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:21.070] most
[00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:21.570] important.
[00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.230] And
[00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.430] I
[00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.650] think
[00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:23.850] the
[00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:24.090] BI
[00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:24.430] just
[00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.070] didn't
[00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.490] prioritize
[00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:26.930] it
[00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:27.250] as
[00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:27.530] much
[00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.710] as
[00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.910] some
[00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.990] of
[00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.090] the
[00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:28.290] other
[00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:28.750] hospitals.
[00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.430] OK,
[00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:32.090] so
[00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:32.310] then
[00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.470] I
[00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.690] said,
[00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.950] well,
[00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:33.450] if
[00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:33.590] you
[00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:33.790] look
[00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.970] at
[00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:34.590] prescriptions,
[00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.130] how
[00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.470] often
[00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.710] are
[00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.890] they
[00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:38.150] given?
[00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:38.490] So
[00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:38.850] remember,
[00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:39.090] we
[00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:39.270] have
[00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.510] about
[00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.910] 60

[00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.090] ICU
[00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:41.590] stays.
[00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.490] And
[00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:42.850] so
[00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:43.870] isoasmotic
[00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:44.510] dextrose
[00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.410] was
[00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.750] given
[00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:46.250] 87
[00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.830],000
[00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:47.370] times
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.000] to
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.260] various
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:50.740] people.
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:51.680] Sodium

[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:54.220] Do
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:54.260] you
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:54.380] know
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:54.540] what
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:54.740] that
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:54.980] is?
[00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.110] Have
[00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:57.210] you
[00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:57.390] ever
[00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:57.590] had
[00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:57.750] an
[00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.990] IV?
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.320] So
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:00.800] periodically,
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.160] the
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:01.380] nurse
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:01.680] comes
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:01.980] by
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.200] and
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:02.640] squirts
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:02.840] a

[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:03.200] bit
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:03.340] of

[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:03.900] in

[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:04.880] to
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.060] make
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:05.280] sure
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:05.520] that
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:05.640] it
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.000] hasn't

[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:06.620] up.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:07.420] That's
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:07.560] what
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:07.780] that

[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:26.460] people
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:26.680] are
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.080] often

[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:29.500] And
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:29.720] then
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:29.920] you
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.260] go,
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:30.980] so
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:31.380] why
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:31.620] is
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:31.900] there

[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:36.760] And
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.020] that's
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.320] probably
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:37.720] some

[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:42.700] them
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.160] has
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.040] an
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.460] NDC
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:44.920] code
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.380] associated
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:45.940] with
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:46.120] it,
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:46.240] and
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:46.360] the
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:46.480] other
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:46.720] one
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.800] doesn't,
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.020] but
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:48.460] probably
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:48.860] should.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:49.700] Yeah?
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:50.340] Oh,
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:50.560] I'd
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:50.720] actually
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:50.900] like
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:50.920] to
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.180] ask,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:51.600] do

[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:52.800] they're
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.020] standard

[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:53.820] hospitals,
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.000] or
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.180] just
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:54.320] that
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:54.440] we
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:54.560] don't
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:54.760] have
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:54.880] the
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.060] data?
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:57.800] The
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.400] NDC
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.000] code
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.900] should
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.160] be

[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.140] across
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:01.520] the
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:01.860] country,
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:02.620] because
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.000] those
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.160] are
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:03.560] FDA

[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.520] codes,
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.340] but
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:05.600] not
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:05.840] every
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.240] hospital
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:06.680] uses
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.040] them.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.600] And
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.200] for

[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:09.580] ones
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:09.840] that
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.100] say
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.500] zero,
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:10.920] I'm
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:11.140] not
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.400] sure
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:11.900] why
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:12.520] they're
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:12.760] not
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.300] associated
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:13.680] with
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:13.840] the
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.100] code
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:14.380] in
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:14.940] this
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.040] hospital's
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:16.600] database.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.600] The
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.320] next
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:22.560] most
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.000] common,
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:23.240] you
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:23.620] see
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:24.360] normal
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.060] saline,

[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:29.680] So
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:29.820] that
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:29.960] was
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.180] the
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:30.380] same
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:30.780] stuff
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:30.960] as

[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.020] solution,
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:32.780] but
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.020] this
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:33.240] time
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:33.480] not
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:33.780] being
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.100] used
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:34.320] for

[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.240] Metoprolol
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:36.460] is
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:36.620] a
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:36.840] beta
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.440] blocker.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:38.580] Here's
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:38.920] another
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.480] insulin,
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:39.880] this
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.120] time
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:40.380] with
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:40.560] an

[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.480] code,
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:42.700] et
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:42.980] cetera.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.060] I
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:44.420] love
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.000] bag
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.340] and
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:45.780] vial.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:46.880] OK?
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:48.800] So
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.440] these
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:49.580] are
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:49.820] not
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.260] exactly
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:50.940] medications.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:51.840] A
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.200] bag
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:52.660] is
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:53.520] literally
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:53.980] like
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.380] a
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:54.880] baggie
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.680] that
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.120] they
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:56.400] put
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:56.760] something
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.220] into,
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:57.960] and
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.140] a
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:58.440] vial
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:58.700] is
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.060] literally
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:38:59.560] something
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:38:59.880] that
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.060] they
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:00.380] put
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:00.840] pills
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.120] in.
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:01.980] And
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.300] why
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:02.480] is
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:02.700] that
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:02.860] in
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.000] the
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:03.320] database?
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:03.900] Because
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.160] they
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:04.340] get
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:04.500] to
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:04.820] charge
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:05.100] for
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:05.300] it.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:06.960] And
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.420] I
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:07.560] don't
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:07.700] know
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:07.900] what
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.060] the
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:08.340] charge
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:08.580] is,
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:08.840] but
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.060] it
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:09.300] wouldn't
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:09.740] surprise
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:09.980] me
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.160] if
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:10.360] you're
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:10.660] paying
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.400] $5
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:11.920] for
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.100] a
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:12.440] plastic
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:12.940] bag
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:13.580] to
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:13.800] put
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.200] something
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:14.460] in.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.000] OK.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.060] So
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:17.380] if
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:17.520] we
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:17.780] say,
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.040] well,
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.540] how
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:19.800] many
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.300] pharmacy
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:20.700] orders
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:20.960] are
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.160] there
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:21.440] per
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:21.880] admission
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.380] at
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:22.600] this
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.020] hospital?
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:23.860] And
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.040] the
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:24.320] answer
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:24.800] is
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.340] a
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:25.680] lot.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:26.660] So
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:27.020] if
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:27.180] you
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.420] look
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:27.600] at,
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:28.380] it's
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:28.500] a
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:28.680] very

[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:29.540]-tailed
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:29.960] distribution,
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:30.620] goes
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:30.840] out
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.040] to
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:31.320] about

[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:31.980],500.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.140] But
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:33.320] you
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:33.680] see,
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.340] if
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:34.520] I
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:34.880] blow
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.240] up
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:35.660] just
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:35.940] the

[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:36.800] up
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:36.980] to
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:37.280] about
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:37.880] 200,
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.400] there's
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:39.740] a
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:39.980] very
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:40.420] large
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:40.820] number
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.240] of
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:41.580] people
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.000] with
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.860] two
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.060] prescriptions
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.400] filled,
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.200] and
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:48.440] then
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:48.640] a
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.000] fairly
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.360] declining
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:50.880] number
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.220] with
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:51.960] more.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:52.780] And
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:52.920] then
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.120] it's
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:53.240] a
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:53.420] very
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:53.760] long
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.080] tail.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:54.360] So
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:54.580] can
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:54.740] you
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:55.220] imagine
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.140] 2
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:56.600],500
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.380] things
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.220] prescribed
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:58.660] for
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:58.840] you
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.180] during
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:39:59.960] a
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.480] hospital
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:00.900] stay?
[00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:03.350] Well,
[00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:03.970] a
[00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:04.130] little
[00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.430] more
[00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.790] about
[00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:05.710] standards.
[00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:06.070] So
[00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:06.690] NDC
[00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:07.270] is
[00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.630] probably
[00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.890] the
[00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:08.170] best
[00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:08.330] of
[00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:08.490] the
[00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:08.750] coding
[00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:09.310] systems.
[00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:10.730] And
[00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:11.050] it's
[00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:11.390] developed
[00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.670] by
[00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.870] the
[00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:12.230] FDA.
[00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:13.470] The
[00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.730] picture
[00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:14.090] up
[00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:14.250] on
[00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:14.410] the
[00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:14.650] top
[00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:14.970] right
[00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:15.530] shows
[00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.710] that
[00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.930] the
[00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:17.190] first
[00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.490] four
[00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:17.790] digits
[00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:18.430] are
[00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:19.390] the
[00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:19.950] so
[00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:20.170]-called
[00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:20.730] labeler.
[00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:21.230] That's
[00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.690] usually
[00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:22.010] the
[00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.310] person
[00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.570] who
[00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.010] produced
[00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:23.250] the
[00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:23.570] drugs,
[00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.810] or
[00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.990] at
[00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.130] least
[00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:24.330] the
[00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:24.610] person
[00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:24.870] who
[00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:25.430] distributes
[00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.730] them.
[00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:27.250] The
[00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:27.890] second
[00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:28.410] four
[00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:28.790]-digit
[00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:29.170] number
[00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:29.790] is
[00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:30.830] the
[00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:31.310] form
[00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.510] of
[00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.710] the
[00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:32.070] drug.
[00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:32.570] So
[00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:32.870] whether
[00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:33.210] it's
[00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:33.730] capsules,
[00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:33.970] or
[00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:34.390] tablets,
[00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:34.890] or
[00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:35.890] liquid,
[00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:36.310] or
[00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:36.830] whatever,
[00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:38.130] and
[00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:38.310] the
[00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:38.690] dose.
[00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.450] And
[00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:39.690] then
[00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:40.250] the
[00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:41.970] last
[00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:42.190] two
[00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.470] digits
[00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.910] are
[00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:43.090] a
[00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:43.410] package
[00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:43.850] code,
[00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:44.610] which
[00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:45.130] translates
[00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:45.630] into
[00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.910] the
[00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:46.150] total
[00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.510] number
[00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.750] of
[00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.090] doses
[00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:47.570] that
[00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:47.710] are
[00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:47.870] in
[00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.990] a
[00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.370] package.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:49.720] So
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:49.980] this
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.140] is
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:50.280] a
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:50.880] godsend.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:51.640] And
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:51.960] all
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.120] of
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.300] the
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:52.680] robotic
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.480] pharmacies
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:53.780] and
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:54.000] so
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.180] on
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:54.620] rely
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.120] on
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:55.900] using
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:56.280] this
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:56.540] kind
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:56.660] of
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:57.260] information
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.360] nowadays.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.640] Unfortunately,
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:01.660] they
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.020] ran
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.360] out
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:02.960] of
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.660] four
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:03.980]-digit
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.480] numbers.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:05.360] And
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:05.680] so
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.140] there's
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:06.560] now
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:06.960] a,
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:07.900] they
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:08.260] added
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:08.500] an
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:08.800] extra
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.220] digit,
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:10.380] but
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:10.620] they
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:10.880] didn't
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.060] do
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:11.220] it
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:11.780] systematically.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:12.320] And
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:12.500] so
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.000] sometimes
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:13.260] they
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:13.620] added
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.260] an
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:14.540] extra
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:14.840] digit
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.120] to
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:15.300] the
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:15.660] labeler
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:15.980] and
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:16.380] sometimes
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:16.660] to
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:16.840] the
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.120] product
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:17.540] code.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.240] And
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:18.460] so
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:18.780] there's
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:18.960] a
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.300] nightmare
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:19.740] of
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.380] translations
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.100] between
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:21.880] the
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.120] old
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:22.520] codes
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:22.720] and
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:22.880] the
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.080] new
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:23.480] codes.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:23.740] And
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:23.860] you
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.060] have
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:24.180] to
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:24.360] have
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:24.520] a
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:24.720] code
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.120] dictionary
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:25.560] in
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:25.740] order
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:26.040] to
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:26.600] do
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:26.740] it
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.200] properly
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:27.480] and
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:27.680] so
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:27.860] on.
[00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.910] OK,
[00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:29.310] well,
[00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.930] if
[00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:30.150] that
[00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.430] weren't
[00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.670] good
[00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:31.090] enough,
[00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.090] the

[00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.770] which
[00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:42.950] is
[00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:43.230] also

[00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:46.050] And
[00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:46.290] this
[00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:46.450] is
[00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:46.610] an

[00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:53.430] There
[00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.790] are
[00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:55.390] also
[00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.990] CPT
[00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.390] is

[00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:02.090] which
[00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:02.270] we'll
[00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.550] talk
[00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.810] about

[00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:03.090] a
[00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:03.210] little
[00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:03.470] bit.
[00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:04.330] And
[00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:04.730] they
[00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:05.030] have
[00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.230] a

[00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:07.190] which
[00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.690] also
[00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:08.430] correspond
[00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:09.110] to

[00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:10.330] administration.
[00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.450] And
[00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.630] so
[00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.850] this
[00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:12.050] is
[00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.250] yet
[00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:12.550] another

[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:15.590] And
[00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:16.430] then
[00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.550] the
[00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.670] HCPCS
[00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:22.170] is
[00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:22.470] yet
[00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.830] another
[00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:23.170] set
[00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:23.370] of

[00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.790] what
[00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:26.270] medicines
[00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.590] you've
[00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:26.770] given
[00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:27.050] to
[00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.470] somebody.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:29.400] And
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:29.700] then
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.480] I
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:31.720] had
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.120] mentioned
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:32.460] this
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.160] GSN

[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:33.940] which
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:34.520] apparently
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.060] the

[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:35.740] Israel
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.180] uses.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.120] This
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:37.300] is
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:37.480] a
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:37.900] commercial
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.380] coding
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:38.840] system
[00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:39.600] from
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:39.760] a
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.060] company
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.420] called
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:40.760] First
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.020] Data
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:41.400] Bank
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:42.360] that
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:42.620] is
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:42.800] in
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:42.940] the
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:43.260] business
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:43.560] of
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:43.860] trying
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.100] to
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:44.480] produce
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.120] standards.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:46.600] But
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.000] in
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.240] this
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:47.520] case,
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:47.820] they're
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:48.240] producing
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:48.680] ones
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:48.940] that
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:49.080] are
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:49.380] pretty
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:49.880] redundant
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.800] with
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.100] other
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:51.520] existing
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.080] standards.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:52.460] But
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:52.940] nevertheless,
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:53.860] for
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.400] historical
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:54.940] reasons
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:55.320] or
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:55.620] for
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:55.920] whatever
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.460] reasons,
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:56.820] people
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.040] are
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:57.340] using
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:57.720] these.
[00:42:59.010 --> 00:42:59.250] OK,
[00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:00.290] enough
[00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.490] of
[00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:00.850] drugs.
[00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.570] So
[00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:01.810] what
[00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:02.350] procedures
[00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:02.690] were
[00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.950] done
[00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:03.150] to
[00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.350] a
[00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:03.710] patient?
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.020] If
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:05.140] you
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:05.380] look
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:05.540] in
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:05.920] MIMIC,
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:06.700] there
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:06.820] are

[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:15.220] procedures.
[00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:16.930] There's
[00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:17.530] CPT

[00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:23.450] events
[00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.750] that

[00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:26.670] terminology.
[00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.950] And
[00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:28.230] then
[00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:29.650] MetaVision,
[00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:30.050] the

[00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.490] has
[00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:32.930] about
[00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:33.110] a

[00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:33.790] million
[00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:34.370] procedure
[00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.990] events

[00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:36.990] system.
[00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.830] So
[00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:38.130] some
[00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:38.710] examples,
[00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.930] here's

[00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.710] codes.
[00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:44.630] So
[00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:45.250] ICD
[00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:45.490]-9
[00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:45.790] code

[00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:50.770] instances,
[00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.990] is

[00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:56.350] classified.
[00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.610] So
[00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:57.910] what's
[00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:58.250] venous
[00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:59.130] catheterization?
[00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:00.890] It's
[00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.070] when
[00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:01.450] somebody
[00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:01.810] sticks
[00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:02.030] an
[00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.250] IV
[00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:02.510] in
[00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.690] your
[00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:02.950] vein.
[00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:05.810] Very
[00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:06.250] common.
[00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:06.570] You
[00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:06.890] show
[00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:07.090] up
[00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:07.190] at
[00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.290] a
[00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:07.690] hospital.
[00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:08.570] Before
[00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:08.830] they
[00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:09.130] ask
[00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:09.270] you
[00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.470] your
[00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.730] name,
[00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:09.950] they
[00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:10.210] stick
[00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:10.410] an
[00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:10.650] IV
[00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:10.890] in
[00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:11.090] your
[00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:11.350] arm.
[00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:14.050] That's
[00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:14.190] a
[00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.550] billable
[00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.950] event,
[00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:15.230] too.
[00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:17.870] And
[00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:18.430] insertion
[00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.590] of
[00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:18.770] an
[00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:20.290] endotracheal
[00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:20.650] tube.
[00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:21.870] If
[00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:22.050] you're
[00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:22.290] having
[00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:22.570] any
[00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.130] problems
[00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:23.470] like
[00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.730] that,
[00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:23.990] they
[00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.270] stick
[00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:25.370] something
[00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.670] down
[00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.890] your
[00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:26.210] throat.
[00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:27.310] Enteral
[00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:27.790] infusion
[00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:28.010] of
[00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.670] concentrated
[00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:29.350] nutritional
[00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:30.050] substances.
[00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:30.830] So
[00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:30.990] if
[00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.090] you're
[00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:31.290] not
[00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:31.530] able
[00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:31.770] to
[00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.090] eat,
[00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.810] then
[00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:33.010] they
[00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:33.370] feed
[00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:33.670] you
[00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:34.010] through
[00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.810] a
[00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:35.150] stomach
[00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.470] tube.
[00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:36.430] So
[00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.890] that's
[00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:37.290] what
[00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:37.550] that
[00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:37.890] is.
[00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:40.330] Continuous
[00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:40.830] invasive
[00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:41.450] mechanical
[00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:42.130] ventilation
[00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.990] for
[00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:43.290] less
[00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:43.490] than
[00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:44.090] 96
[00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:44.690] consecutive
[00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:45.250] hours.
[00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:45.930] So
[00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:46.210] this
[00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:46.390] is
[00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.670] being
[00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:47.010] put
[00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.350] on
[00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:47.670] a
[00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.250] ventilator
[00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.890] that's
[00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:50.230] breathing
[00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.610] for
[00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:50.950] you,
[00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:51.490] et
[00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:51.790] cetera.
[00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:52.190] So
[00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.350] you
[00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:52.610] see
[00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:52.870] that
[00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:53.330] there's
[00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:53.550] a
[00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:54.190] very
[00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:54.510] long
[00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.850] tail
[00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:55.070] of
[00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:55.350] these.
[00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.150] So
[00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.430] those
[00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:56.550] are
[00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.730] the
[00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:57.170] ICD
[00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.430]-9
[00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.870] codes.
[00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.690] Now,
[00:44:58.810 --> 00:44:59.310] CPT
[00:44:59.310 --> 00:44:59.790] has
[00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:00.010] its
[00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:00.250] own
[00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:00.710] procedure
[00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:01.290] codes
[00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:02.710] that
[00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.950] go
[00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:03.210] into
[00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:03.730] tremendous
[00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:04.130] amount
[00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.330] of
[00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:04.770] detail.
[00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.950] So
[00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:06.250] for
[00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:06.590] example,
[00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.950] this
[00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:07.110] is
[00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:07.310] the
[00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:07.610] medicine
[00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:08.430] subsection.
[00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:09.230] And
[00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.410] it
[00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.770] shows
[00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:10.070] you
[00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:10.470] the
[00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.850] kinds
[00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:11.350] of
[00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.110] drugs
[00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:12.430] that
[00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.650] you're
[00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.990] being
[00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.750] administered
[00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:14.990] that
[00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.570] are
[00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.070] involved
[00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:16.530] in
[00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:17.870] dialysis,
[00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.430] or
[00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:19.890] psychiatry,
[00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:20.190] or
[00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.930] vaccines,
[00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:21.290] or
[00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.610] whatever.
[00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:23.010] And
[00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:23.290] then
[00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:23.630] here
[00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.770] are
[00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:23.970] the
[00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:24.350] surgical
[00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:24.970] and
[00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:25.130] the
[00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.970] radiological
[00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:26.950] codes.
[00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.710] And
[00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:28.050] there's
[00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:28.310] tons
[00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:28.590] and
[00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:28.770] tons
[00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:29.010] of
[00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:29.370] detail
[00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:29.610] on
[00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:29.810] these.
[00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:29.990] Yeah?
[00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.610] So
[00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:30.910] how
[00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:31.110] can
[00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:31.270] they
[00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.490] put
[00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.750] these
[00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:32.090] codes
[00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:32.290] as
[00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:32.690] 1
[00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:33.170],000
[00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.370] to
[00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:33.570] 1
[00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:34.290],022?
[00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.910] This
[00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:35.270] seems
[00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.690] really
[00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:36.190] annoying
[00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.470] for
[00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.830] anyone.
[00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:36.990] No,
[00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.250] these
[00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:37.410] are
[00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:37.970] categories.
[00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.390] So
[00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.970] if
[00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:39.430] you
[00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.730] drill
[00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:40.190] down,
[00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:41.150] there's
[00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.930] a
[00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.590] fan
[00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:44.810] out
[00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:44.990] of
[00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.230] that
[00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.530] tree.
[00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.870] And
[00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:46.170] you
[00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:46.390] get
[00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.670] down
[00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.850] to
[00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:47.330] individual
[00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:47.890] codes.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:49.620] Just
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:49.860] as
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.360] a
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:50.700] nasty
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.440] surprise,
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:52.820] CPT
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.100] is
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:53.440] owned
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:53.760] by
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.000] the

[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:54.780] College
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.020] of
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:55.520] Physicians.
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:56.400] And
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.400] they
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.000] could
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:45:59.300] sue
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:45:59.540] me
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:45:59.780] if
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:45:59.960] I
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.320] showed
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:00.520] you
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:00.780] the
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:01.340] actual
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:01.880] codes,
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:02.760] because
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.240] they're
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.320] copyrighted.
[00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:06.470] And
[00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:07.150] you
[00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.310] have
[00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:07.430] to
[00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.670] pay
[00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.930] them
[00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:08.390] if
[00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.990] you
[00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.270] use
[00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.530] those
[00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:09.910] codes.
[00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.730] It's
[00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:11.150] crazy.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:13.940] OK.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:14.880] So
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.500] if
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:15.640] you
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:15.860] look
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:15.980] at
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:16.220] the
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:16.600] number
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.120] of
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:17.520] all
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:17.700] of
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:17.940] these
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:18.360] codes
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:18.760] per
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.220] admission,
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:20.060] you
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:20.340] see
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:20.780] a
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:21.180] distribution
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:21.800] like
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.240] this.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.060] Or
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:23.260] if
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:23.460] I
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:23.880] separate
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.180] them
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:24.400] out,
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:24.600] you
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:24.840] see
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.080] that
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:25.680] there
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:25.780] are
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:25.980] more
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.480] ICD
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:26.740]-9
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.200] codes
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:27.540] and
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.200] fewer
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:28.720] of
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:28.900] the
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:29.440] CPT
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:29.740] and
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:30.060] the
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.100] codes
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:31.300] that
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:31.440] are
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:31.820] in
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:32.400] MetaVision.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:33.240] But
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:33.440] they
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:33.820] look
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:34.440] somewhat
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:34.900] similar
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:35.200] in
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:35.360] their
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:35.960] distributions.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:37.940] OK.
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:38.540] Lab
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:38.980] measurements.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.040] So
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:40.220] you
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:40.520] send
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:40.900] off
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:41.460] a
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:41.780] sputum
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.300] sample,
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:42.800] blood,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:43.220] urine,
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:43.860] a
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:44.080] piece
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:44.240] of
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:44.420] your
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:44.820] brain,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:45.540] something.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:46.680] They
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.040] stick
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:47.200] it
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:47.440] in
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:47.880] some
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:48.140] goo
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.460] and
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:48.960] measure
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.340] something
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:49.740] about
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:49.940] it.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:50.480] So
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:50.680] what
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:50.820] is
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:50.980] it
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:51.140] that
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:51.340] they're
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:51.720] measuring?
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:52.460] Well,
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:52.940] it
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:53.220] turns
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:53.540] out
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.040] that
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.560] hematocrit
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.020] is
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:56.220] the
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:56.420] most
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:56.820] common
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.320] measurement.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:57.660] So
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:57.920] this
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.500] is
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:58.700] how
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.000] much
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.500] hemoglobin
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:00.720] is
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:00.880] in
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.020] your
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:01.380] blood
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:02.700] or
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:02.900] what
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:03.360] fraction
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:03.920] in
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:04.100] your
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:04.420] blood
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:05.240] and
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:05.480] is
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:05.760] very
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.220] important
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:06.740] for
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:07.000] sick
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:07.400] people.
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.000] And
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:09.440] the
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:09.720] second
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:10.060] most
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:10.820] important
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:11.100] is
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:11.720] potassium,
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.040] then
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:12.460] sodium,
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.060] creatinine,
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:13.540] chloride,
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:14.640] urea,
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.200] nitrogen,
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.140] bicarbonate,
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:16.340] et
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:16.580] cetera.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:16.980] So
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:17.220] this
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:17.400] is
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:17.580] a
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:17.860] long,
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.100] long
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:18.480] list
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:18.880] of
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.180] different
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:19.560] things
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:19.760] that
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:19.980] can
[00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:20.160] be
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:20.560] measured.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.200] And
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:21.380] all
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:21.560] this
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:21.820] stuff
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:22.000] is
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:22.160] in
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:22.300] the
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:22.800] database.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.080] So
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:24.300] for
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:24.700] example,
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:25.580] here's
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.080] patient
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:26.440] number
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:26.960] two
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.800] in
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.100] the
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:28.700] database.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.400] And
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.080] on
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:33.460] July
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.080] 17
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:34.420] of
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.380] 2138,
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.380] this
[00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.830] is
[00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:38.110] part
[00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:38.250] of
[00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:38.410] the
[00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:38.590] de
[00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:39.330]-identification
[00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:39.910] process
[00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:40.370] to
[00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.950] make
[00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:41.110] it
[00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:41.490] difficult
[00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:41.830] to
[00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:42.030] figure
[00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.370] out
[00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:42.870] who
[00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:43.050] the
[00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:43.370] patient
[00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:43.870] actually
[00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:44.270] is.
[00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:45.230] This
[00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.910] person
[00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:46.930] got
[00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.830] a
[00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:49.170] test
[00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:49.570] for
[00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.390] their
[00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:51.810] blood.
[00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.850] And
[00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:54.370] they
[00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:54.890] reported
[00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:55.710] atypical
[00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:56.530] lymphocytes.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:57.840] So
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.020] there
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:58.100] are
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:58.260] a
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:58.360] couple
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:58.540] of
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:58.940] interesting
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.360] things
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:47:59.600] to
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:47:59.820] note
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:00.120] here.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:02.140] One
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:02.480] is
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.420] that
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:04.420] some
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:04.780] things
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:05.020] have
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:05.180] a
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:05.540] value
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:05.860] and
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:06.160] others
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:06.620] don't.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:07.240] So
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:07.480] this
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:07.640] is
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:07.800] a
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.160] qualitative
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:08.780] measure.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:09.320] So
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:09.600] there's
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:09.780] no
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:10.120] value
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:10.740] associated
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:11.120] with
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:11.300] it.
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:11.980] Just
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.260] the
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:12.640] fact
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.020] of
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:13.240] the
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:13.580] label
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.180] tells
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:14.340] you
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:14.520] what
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:14.720] the
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.040] result
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:15.240] of
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:15.420] the
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:15.680] test
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:15.980] was.
[00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:17.070] The
[00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:17.250] other
[00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:17.470] thing
[00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.730] that's
[00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:18.110] interesting
[00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.950] is
[00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:19.190] this
[00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.530] last
[00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:19.950] column,
[00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:20.270] which
[00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.510] is
[00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.870] LOINC.
[00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:21.290] And
[00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.450] I'll
[00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:21.690] say
[00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:21.870] a
[00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:22.010] word
[00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.310] about

[00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.910] in

[00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:23.270] minute,
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:25.720] actually,
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.060] right
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:26.420] now.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:28.260] So
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:28.640] LOINC
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:28.960] is
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.200] the
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:29.740] Logical

[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:33.880] It
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.100] was
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:34.500] developed
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:34.860] by

[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.600] about

[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:40.760] years
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:41.100] ago,
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:41.460] maybe
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:41.860] 20
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:42.140] years
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:42.400] ago
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:42.560] at
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:42.760] this
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.020] point.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:44.420] And
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:44.820] the
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:45.240] attempt
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:45.600] was
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:45.840] to
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.200] say
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.020] every
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:47.480] different
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:47.860] type
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.060] of
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:48.460] laboratory
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.080] test
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:49.420] ought
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:49.520] to
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:49.740] have
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:49.900] a
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:50.180] unique
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:50.600] name.
[00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:52.010] And
[00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.250] they
[00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.430] ought
[00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.510] to
[00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.710] be
[00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:53.610] hierarchical
[00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:53.970] so
[00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:54.270] that
[00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.590] if
[00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:54.790] you
[00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:55.030] have,
[00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:55.250] for
[00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:55.670] example,
[00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.470] three
[00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.870] different
[00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:57.190] ways
[00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.410] of
[00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.790] measuring
[00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:58.190] serum
[00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.810] potassium,
[00:48:59.570 --> 00:48:59.850] that
[00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:00.130] they're
[00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:00.510] related
[00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:00.790] to
[00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:01.030] each
[00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.290] other,
[00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:01.690] but
[00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:01.890] that
[00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:02.330] they're
[00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:02.930] distinct
[00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:03.190] from
[00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.410] each
[00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:03.650] other.
[00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:04.090] Because
[00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:04.730] there
[00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:04.950] may
[00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:05.150] be
[00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.910] circumstances
[00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:06.330] under
[00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:06.730] which
[00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:07.070] the
[00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:07.530] errors
[00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:07.810] that
[00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:07.950] you
[00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:08.170] get
[00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:08.450] from
[00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:08.730] one
[00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:09.190] measurement
[00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.990] versus
[00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.450] another
[00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:10.750] are
[00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:11.090] different.
[00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.350] And
[00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:13.670] so
[00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:14.350] this
[00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:14.790] is
[00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:15.430] the
[00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.850] standard
[00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:16.290] way.
[00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:16.650] If
[00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:16.810] you
[00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:17.170] send
[00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:17.430] off
[00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.650] your
[00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:17.910] blood
[00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:18.290] sample
[00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.590] to
[00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:18.770] a
[00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:19.090] lab,
[00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:19.870] they
[00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:20.250] send
[00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:20.650] back
[00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:20.950] a
[00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:21.270] string
[00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.590] like
[00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:21.970] this
[00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:22.650] to
[00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:22.870] the
[00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:23.250] hospital
[00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:23.590] or

[00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:25.690] that
[00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:26.150] says,
[00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.510] it's
[00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.870] coded

[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:00.400] So

[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:06.360] huge
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:06.720] long
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.160] tail,
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:07.800] up
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:08.020] to
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:08.300] about
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:08.740] 15
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:09.180],000
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:09.620] for
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:09.780] a
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:09.960] very
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.300] small
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:10.640] number
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.340] of
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:11.840] patients.
[00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:14.230] If
[00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.390] you
[00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.690] look
[00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:15.170] at
[00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.990] lab
[00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.310] tests
[00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:16.590] per
[00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:17.030] admission,
[00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:18.330] you
[00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:18.750] can
[00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:20.330] do
[00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:20.490] a
[00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:20.690] log
[00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:21.230] transform
[00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.630] and
[00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.850] get
[00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:22.190] something
[00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.450] that
[00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:22.710] looks
[00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.990] like
[00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.130] a
[00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:23.310] more
[00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:23.730] reasonable
[00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:24.430] distribution.
[00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.330] By
[00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:25.430] the
[00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.530] way,
[00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:25.790] that's
[00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.890] a
[00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:26.050] very
[00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:26.490] generic
[00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:27.050] lesson
[00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.550] when
[00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:27.830] we're
[00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:28.210] going
[00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:28.410] to
[00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:28.590] do
[00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:29.070] analyses
[00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:29.450] of
[00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.650] these
[00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:29.970] data,
[00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:30.810] is
[00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:31.010] that
[00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.370] often
[00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.790] doing
[00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:31.970] a
[00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:32.570] transform
[00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:32.830] of
[00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:33.090] some
[00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:33.450] sort,
[00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:33.810] like
[00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:34.010] in
[00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:34.210] this
[00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:34.490] case
[00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.670] a
[00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.990] log,
[00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:36.270] takes
[00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:36.570] some
[00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:36.910] funny
[00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:37.250] looking
[00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.750] distribution
[00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:38.270] and
[00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.550] turns
[00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:38.710] it
[00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.930] into
[00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:39.290] something
[00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:39.610] that
[00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:39.910] looks
[00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:40.950] plausibly
[00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:41.370] normal,
[00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.930] which
[00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:42.170] is
[00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.750] better
[00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:43.050] for
[00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:43.250] a
[00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.370] lot
[00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.490] of
[00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:43.670] the
[00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:44.030] techniques
[00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.250] we
[00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:44.450] use.
[00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:44.650] Yeah?
[00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:45.430] AUDIENCE
[00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.430] 2
[00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.430] So
[00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.970] across
[00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:46.590] hospitals,
[00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:48.370] do
[00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:49.390] LOINC
[00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.670] codes
[00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:50.090] mean
[00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:50.230] the
[00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.430] same
[00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.690] thing?
[00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:51.190] Yes.
[00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.390] AUDIENCE
[00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.390] 2
[00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.770] Like,
[00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:51.910] I'm
[00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:52.010] a
[00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.150] doctor
[00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.570] at
[00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:52.950] one
[00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:53.310] hospital,
[00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.810] and
[00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:54.150] at
[00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.290] another,
[00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.530] it's
[00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.530] the
[00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.870] same?
[00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:55.390] Yes.
[00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.510] Yes,
[00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:57.430] that's
[00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.570] the
[00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:57.750] whole
[00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:58.110] idea
[00:50:58.110 --> 00:50:58.410] of
[00:50:58.410 --> 00:50:58.790] creating
[00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:59.050] the
[00:50:59.050 --> 00:50:59.390] standard.
[00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:00.670] And
[00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.850] that
[00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:01.110] has
[00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:01.330] been
[00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:01.590] pretty
[00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:02.790] successful,
[00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.970] pretty
[00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:03.570] successfully
[00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:04.130] adopted.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:06.420] OK,
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:07.680] chart
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.040] events.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:08.300] So
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:08.580] these
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:08.720] are
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:08.920] the
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:09.220] things
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:09.500] that
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:09.860] nurses
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.380] typically
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:10.900] enter
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:11.320] at
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:11.520] the
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.080] bedside.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:13.320] And
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:13.640] so
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.540] there
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:14.820] are
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:15.320] 5
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:15.900].1,

[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:17.980] rates
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:18.780] measured
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:19.060] in
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:19.200] the
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:19.420] MIMIC
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:20.020] database.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:21.520] And
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.600] a
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.220] calprev
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:23.600] slug
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:24.480] is
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:24.920] an
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.280] artifact.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:26.240] It
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:26.640] exists
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:26.900] in
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.180] every
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:27.620] record.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:28.680] And
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.180] it's
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:29.400] some
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.140] calibration,
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:31.100] something
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:31.360] or
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:31.520] other
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:31.760] that
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.080] doesn't
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:32.300] mean
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:32.640] anything.
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:33.260] I've
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:33.480] never
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:33.680] been

[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:34.520] out
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:34.940] exactly
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:35.180] what
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:35.320] it
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:35.560] is.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:36.800] SpO2
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:37.200] is
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:37.800] the

[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.140] in
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:40.340] your
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:40.660] blood.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.260] If
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:41.400] you
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:41.600] use
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:41.760] a
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.000] pulse
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:42.640] oximeter,
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.040] that's
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.180] what
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:43.520] that's
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:43.960] measuring.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:45.460] Respiratory

[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:48.220] dot.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:49.280] Now,
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:49.800] you
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.040] might
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.280] be
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:50.600] troubled
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:50.940] by
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:51.160] the
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:51.440] fact
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:51.700] that
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:52.020] here's

[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:52.920] again,
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:55.340] right?
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.020] But
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:56.240] I've
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:56.480] already
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:56.840] shown
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.040] you
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:57.420] this,
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:57.860] that
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.820] heart
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:51:59.180] rate
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:51:59.660] in
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:00.900] CareView
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:01.320] and
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:01.700] heart
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.020] rate
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:02.320] in
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:02.980] MetaVision
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:03.680] were
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.160] coded
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.040] under
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:05.580] different
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.180] codes
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.080] in
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:07.280] the
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:07.560] joint
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.100] system
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:08.560] that
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:08.760] we
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.200] created
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:09.500] out
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:09.640] of
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:09.840] those
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:10.060] two
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:10.620] databases.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.120] And
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:12.460] so
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.380] you
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:13.600] have
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:13.760] to
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.060] take
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:14.400] care
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:14.960] of
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:15.960] figuring
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.440] out
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:16.860] what's
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.200] what
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:17.800] if
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.080] you're
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:18.420] trying
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:18.640] to
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:19.020] analyze
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:19.300] this
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:19.580] data.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:20.360] Not
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:20.580] only
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:20.800] do
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:20.920] we
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:21.120] have
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:21.340] that
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:21.700] problem
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:22.220] of
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:22.760] different

[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:23.860] distributions
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:24.920] across
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.180] the
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:25.440] two
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:25.760] different
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.060] data
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:26.480] sets,
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:27.140] but
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:27.320] we
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:27.540] also
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:27.880] just
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:28.080] have
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:28.260] the
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:28.700] mechanical
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.300] problem
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:29.540] that
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.240] there
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:30.400] will
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:30.620] be
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:30.960] things
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.220] with
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:31.400] the
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:31.640] same
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.080] label
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:32.940] that
[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:33.240] may
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:33.420] or
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:33.540] may
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:33.820] not
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:34.340] represent
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:34.720] the
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:34.940] same
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.380] measurement
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:35.900] at
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:36.520] different
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.040] times
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:37.500] in
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:37.660] the
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:37.980] system.
[00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.730] This
[00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.990] is
[00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.310] the
[00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:44.690] number
[00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.970] of
[00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:45.230] chart
[00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.650] entries
[00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.990] per
[00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.430] admission,
[00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:46.830] again,
[00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:47.010] on
[00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:47.130] a
[00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:47.370] log
[00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:47.790] scale.
[00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:48.130] So
[00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:48.450] you
[00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:48.730] see
[00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:49.010] that
[00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.250] there
[00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.410] are
[00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:49.690] about
[00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:50.010] 10
[00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:50.190] to
[00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:50.390] the
[00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.750] 3
[00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:51.610].5
[00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:53.730] chart
[00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:54.150] entries
[00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.450] per
[00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:54.850] admission.
[00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:55.270] So
[00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:56.690] thousands
[00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.670] of
[00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:00.430] admissions,
[00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.770] of
[00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:01.070] chart
[00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:01.690] events
[00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:01.910] per
[00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:02.330] admission.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:03.700] We
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:03.960] also
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.380] track
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.020] outputs.
[00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.530] So
[00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:07.630] Foley
[00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:08.270] catheter
[00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:09.730] allows
[00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:10.330] your
[00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:10.710] bladder
[00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:11.030] to
[00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.410] drain
[00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:11.950] without
[00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:12.210] your
[00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:12.530] having
[00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:13.150] consciously
[00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.470] to
[00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:13.590] go
[00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:13.710] to
[00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:13.850] the
[00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:14.210] bathroom.
[00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:15.030] So
[00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:15.230] they
[00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.670] collect
[00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.930] that
[00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:16.490] information.
[00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:16.910] There
[00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:17.110] are
[00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:17.370] 1
[00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:17.930].9
[00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:18.390] million
[00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:19.390] recordings
[00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.950] of
[00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:20.150] how
[00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.390] much
[00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.730] fluid
[00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:21.110] came
[00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:21.310] out
[00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:21.450] of
[00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:21.610] your
[00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:21.970] bladder.
[00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.990] Chest
[00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.590] tubes
[00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:25.950] will
[00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:26.450] drain
[00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:27.210] stuff
[00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:27.450] out
[00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:27.590] of
[00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:27.770] your
[00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:28.150] chest
[00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.370] if
[00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.510] you
[00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.810] have
[00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:29.450] congestion.
[00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.530] Urine
[00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.730] is
[00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:30.970] if
[00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:31.230] you
[00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.950] pee
[00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:32.610] regularly,
[00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:33.170] stool
[00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.590] out,
[00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:34.630] et
[00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.930] cetera.
[00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:35.990] And
[00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.970] again,
[00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:37.210] I'm
[00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:37.410] not
[00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:37.570] sure
[00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:37.790] I
[00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:38.330] understand
[00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:38.550] what
[00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:38.730] the
[00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:39.090] difference
[00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:39.390] is
[00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:40.450] between
[00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:42.330] urine
[00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:42.710] out
[00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.130] Foley
[00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:43.910] versus
[00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:44.470] Foley.
[00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:45.390] They
[00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.650] may
[00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.770] be
[00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:46.010] the
[00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.250] same
[00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.670] thing,
[00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:47.310] but
[00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:47.630] one
[00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:48.010] from
[00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:48.490] CareView
[00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:48.750] and
[00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.950] one
[00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:49.210] from
[00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:49.730] MetaVision.
[00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:50.790] So
[00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:51.130] again,
[00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:51.790] typical
[00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:52.270] kinds
[00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:52.430] of
[00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.890] problems.
[00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:54.090] If
[00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:54.270] you
[00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:54.510] look
[00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.690] at
[00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:55.030] the
[00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.710] number
[00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:55.990] of
[00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.410] output
[00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:56.930] events
[00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:57.410] per
[00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:58.530] admission,
[00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.830] you're
[00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:00.190] seeing
[00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.470] on
[00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.630] the
[00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.870] order
[00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:01.250] of
[00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:01.790] 100,
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:03.420] roughly.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.180] Well,
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:08.340] if
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:08.480] you're
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:08.820] tracking
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.320] outputs,
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:09.640] you
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:09.860] should
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:10.120] also
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.560] track
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.020] inputs.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:12.000] And
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:12.220] so
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:12.420] they
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:12.780] do.
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:13.700] And
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:14.120] so
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.840] D5W
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.140] is
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:16.400] this
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:16.920] dextrose
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:17.140] in
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:17.520] water,
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.280] 0
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:19.660].9
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:19.980]%
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:20.460] normal
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.060] saline.
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:22.380] Propofol
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:22.600] is
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:22.740] an
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.420] anesthetic.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:24.540] Insulin,
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.160] heparin,
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:26.640] blood
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.000] thinner,
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:27.860] et
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:28.180] cetera.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:28.900] Fentanyl
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:29.100] is,
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:29.600] I
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:29.820] think,
[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:30.960] an
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:31.380] opioid,
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:31.860] if
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:31.980] I
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:32.300] remember
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:32.660] right.
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:33.360] So
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:33.660] these
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:33.880] are
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:34.420] various
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:34.820] things
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:35.060] that
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:35.180] are
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:35.440] given
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:35.720] to
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:36.080] people.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.400] And
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:37.900] they
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.040] affect
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:39.280] the
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:39.660] volume
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.220] of
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:40.400] the
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:40.760] person.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:41.220] So
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:41.480] this
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:41.720] is
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.200] an
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:42.440] attempt
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:42.720] to
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:42.920] keep
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:43.100] the
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:43.420] person
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:43.680] in
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.060] balance
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:44.320] and
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:44.520] keep
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:44.840] track
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.020] of
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:45.300] that.
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:47.160] MetaVision
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:47.580] inputs
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:48.520] are
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.180] classified
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:49.780] somewhat
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.360] differently.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:50.680] But
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.320] they
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:51.560] have
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:52.080] similar
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:52.700] kinds
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:52.900] of
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.180] data.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:53.940] And
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:54.100] if
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:54.260] you
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:54.720] combine
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.020] them,
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:55.200] you
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:55.440] get,
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:55.900] again,
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:56.280] a
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:56.860] distribution
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:57.480] on
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:57.600] a
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:57.860] log
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:58.240] scale
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.480] that
[00:54:59.570 --> 00:54:59.970] shows
[00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:00.250] that
[00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:00.470] there
[00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.670] are
[00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:00.950] on
[00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:01.110] the
[00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:01.350] order
[00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:01.590] of
[00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:02.050] 10
[00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:02.230] to
[00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.410] the
[00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:02.850] fifth
[00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:03.290] input
[00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:03.810] events.
[00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:05.290] So
[00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:05.570] quite
[00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:05.750] a
[00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:06.010] few
[00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:07.330] input
[00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:07.770] events,
[00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:08.530] because
[00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:08.910] this
[00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:09.110] is
[00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:09.570] recorded
[00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:10.350] periodically.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:11.920] Now,
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:12.500] the
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:12.820] paper
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:13.100] that
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:13.240] I
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:13.380] had.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:13.640] Yeah?
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.280] Is
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:14.400] this
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:14.560] like
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:14.960] once
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:15.080] an
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:15.280] input
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:15.520] event
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:15.720] again?
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:16.200] Is
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:16.360] that
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:16.500] like
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:16.620] when
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:16.700] you
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:16.860] come
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:16.980] into
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.080] the
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:17.360] hospital
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:17.580] and
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:17.640] are
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:17.920] admitted?
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:18.700] No,
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:18.840] no,
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:18.960] no.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.540] It's
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:19.800] an
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:20.140] input
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:20.460] into
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:20.740] you.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:21.680] So
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:21.880] it's
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.100] like
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:22.240] you
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:22.480] drink
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:22.640] a
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:22.900] glass
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:23.100] of
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:23.380] water.
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:23.840] The
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:24.220] nurse
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:24.420] is
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:24.620] supposed
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:24.940] to
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:25.280] record
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:25.600] it,
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:26.180] although
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:26.400] she
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:26.760] doesn't
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.120] always,
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:27.420] because
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:27.600] she
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:27.780] may
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:27.980] not
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:28.320] notice
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:28.560] it.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:29.700] But
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:29.900] if
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:30.100] they
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:30.380] hang
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:30.560] an
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:30.800] IV
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.240] bag
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:31.460] and
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:31.840] pour
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:32.020] a
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:32.260] liter
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:32.540] of
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:32.800] liquid
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.140] into
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:33.400] you,
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.000] they
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.200] do
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:34.640] record
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:34.960] that.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:38.140] All
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:38.360] right.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:39.320] So
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:39.700] I
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:39.920] had
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:40.060] you
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:40.280] read
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:40.520] this
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:40.960] interesting
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.440] paper.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.300] And
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:46.840] a
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:47.340] discussion
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:47.800] prior
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:48.060] to
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:48.300] that
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:48.680] paper,
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.080] because
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:49.860] one
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:49.980] of
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.140] the
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:50.520] authors
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:50.860] is
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:51.560] a
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:51.840] former
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.220] student
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:52.460] of
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:52.760] mine.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:52.940] And
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:53.120] I
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:53.400] know
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.100] one
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:54.220] of
[00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:54.340] the
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:54.520] other
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:54.840] guys
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.140] pretty
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:55.440] well.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:56.520] And
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.720] the
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.120] former
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:58.600] student,
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:55:58.900] Zach
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.300] Kohane,
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:00.400] came
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:00.820] back
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.420] some
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:01.740] years
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.020] ago
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:02.380] from
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:02.560] a
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:02.920] conference
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:03.220] in
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:03.740] California
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:05.240] and
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:05.460] was
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:05.920] explaining
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.180] to
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:06.340] me
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:06.560] that
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:06.740] he
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:06.960] ran
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.240] into
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:07.420] a
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:07.680] venture
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.280] capitalist
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.260] who
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:09.880] discovered
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.300] that
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:10.560] there
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:10.680] is
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:10.940] an
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:11.360] interesting
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:11.960] physiological
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.940] variation
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.100] in
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:14.780] the
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:16.560] abnormality
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.120] of
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:17.480] lab
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:17.960] tests
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:18.300] that
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:18.420] are
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:18.640] done
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:18.840] at
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:19.080] night.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:20.300] And
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:20.500] he
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:21.040] suspected
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:21.440] that
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:21.620] there
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:21.720] is
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:21.880] a
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:22.340] diurnal
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:22.960] variation,
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:23.940] that
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:24.240] lab
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:24.560] tests
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:25.020] actually
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:25.540] become
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:25.860] more
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.340] abnormal
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:26.900] at
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.200] night
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:27.460] than
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:27.660] they
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:27.880] do
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:28.200] during
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:28.400] the
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:28.660] day.
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:30.020] And
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:30.400] Zach,
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:30.660] who
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:31.080] is
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:31.400] not
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:31.620] only
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:31.900] a
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:32.200] computer
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:32.620] science
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.020] PhD,
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:33.400] but
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:33.700] also
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:33.920] a
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:34.300] practicing
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:34.820] doctor,
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:35.660] turns
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:35.900] to
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:36.060] him
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:36.300] and
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:36.560] says,
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:36.880] you're
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:37.040] an
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:37.380] idiot.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:39.660] Who
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:40.060] has
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:40.400] their
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.920] blood
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:42.340] drawn
[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:42.720] at
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.000] 3
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:43.200] o
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:43.320]'clock
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:43.520] in
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:43.660] the
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:43.900] morning?
[00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:45.930] It's
[00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:46.310] typically
[00:56:46.310 --> 00:56:46.790] not
[00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:47.130] healthy
[00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:47.570] people.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:49.280] Right?
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:50.940] So
[00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:51.440] this
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:51.620] is
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:52.000] another
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:52.340] of
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:52.580] these
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:52.980] nice
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:53.600] confounding
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.240] stories
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:55.260] where
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:56.880] if
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.240] you
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.000] have
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:58.160] a
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:58.480] test
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:58.900] done
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:56:59.140] in
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:56:59.280] the
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:56:59.460] middle
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:56:59.640] of
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:56:59.760] the
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:56:59.980] night,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:00.160] it
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:00.580] probably
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:01.160] indicates
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:01.420] that
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:01.620] you're
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:01.980] sicker.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:03.540] So
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.160] he
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:04.360] and
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:04.720] Griffin
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.320] recruited
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:05.660] their
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:05.940] third
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:06.260] author
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:06.500] and
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:06.680] went
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:06.960] off
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.600] and
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:07.820] did
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:08.020] a
[00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:08.260] very
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:08.640] large
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:08.920] scale
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.420] study
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:09.620] of
[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:09.820] this
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:10.220] question,
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:10.520] which
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:10.700] is
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:10.920] what
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:11.100] the
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:11.360] paper
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:11.640] that
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:11.900] I
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:12.100] asked
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:12.240] you
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:12.380] to
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:12.620] read
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:13.760] reports
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:14.060] on.
[00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.940] And
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:15.580] so
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.680] I
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.000] said,
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:17.260] well,
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:17.520] I
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:17.700] wonder
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:17.940] if
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:18.100] I
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:18.280] could
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:18.720] reproduce
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.180] that
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:19.620] study
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:20.140] in
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:20.340] the
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:20.560] MIMIC
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:20.960] database.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.420] And
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:22.800] the
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:23.120] answer,
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:23.480] just
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:23.660] in
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:23.900] case
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:24.060] you
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:24.260] get
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:24.440] your
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:24.700] hopes
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:24.980] up,
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:25.220] was
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:25.580] no,
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.720] in
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:28.820] large
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.100] part
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:29.380] because
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:29.680] we
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:29.860] just
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.060] don't
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:30.260] have
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:30.400] the
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:30.600] right
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:30.840] kind
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:30.960] of
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.220] data.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:31.500] So
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:31.640] there
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:31.740] are
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:31.940] not
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.540] that
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:32.900] many
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:33.620] white
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:33.880] blood
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:34.360] counts
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:34.660] that
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:34.920] were
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.340] measured
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:35.660] in
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:35.800] the
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:36.020] MIMIC
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:36.580] database,
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:36.800] for
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.200] example.
[00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.730] But
[00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:39.490] if
[00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:39.670] you
[00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.990] look
[00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.470] at
[00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:41.630] the
[00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:42.130] this
[00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:42.290] is
[00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:42.590] MIMIC
[00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:43.010] data,
[00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:43.790] and
[00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:43.990] if
[00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.190] you
[00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.530] say,
[00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.250] what's
[00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:45.470] the
[00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:45.930] fraction
[00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:46.470] of
[00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:47.090] abnormal
[00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:47.510] white
[00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.750] blood
[00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:48.090] count
[00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:48.630] values
[00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.950] by
[00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:49.330] hour?
[00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.690] So
[00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:49.930] this
[00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:50.130] is
[00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:50.610] midnight
[00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:51.330] to
[00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:51.790] midnight.
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:53.640] And
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.140] each
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:54.600] hour,
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:55.720] there's
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:55.920] some
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.440] fraction

[00:57:59.320 --> 00:57:59.580] And
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:57:59.840] sure
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:00.140] enough,
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:00.400] what

[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:09.980] which
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:11.160] is
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:11.760] consistent

[00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:20.830] So
[00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:21.150] once
[00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.510] again,
[00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:21.950] I
[00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:22.230] said,
[00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:22.510] well,
[00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:22.810] can
[00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:22.970] we
[00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:23.250] build
[00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:23.410] a

[00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:25.310] that
[00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:26.250] predicts
[00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:26.830] who's
[00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:27.010] going
[00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:27.150] to

[00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.570] in
[00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:27.710] the
[00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:28.110] hospital
[00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:28.410] in
[00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:28.610] this
[00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:28.950] case?
[00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:29.770] That's
[00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:29.930] the
[00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:30.250] easiest
[00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:30.590] one
[00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:30.790] to
[00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:31.150] predict
[00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:31.510] because
[00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.730] I
[00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.950] have
[00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:32.170] that
[00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:32.490] data.
[00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:33.750] We
[00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:34.350] could
[00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:34.750] get
[00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:35.230] three
[00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:35.430]-year
[00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.930] survival
[00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:36.370] data,
[00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.730] which
[00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:36.910] is
[00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:37.070] what
[00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:37.250] they
[00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.410] were
[00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:37.690] looking
[00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:38.030] at.
[00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:38.850] But
[00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:39.130] it's
[00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:39.430] harder,
[00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:39.710] and
[00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.850] it
[00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:40.090] runs
[00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:40.390] into
[00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.870] censoring
[00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:41.470] problems
[00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:41.770] of
[00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:42.370] what
[00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:42.830] happens
[00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:43.050] if
[00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:43.250] the
[00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.550] person
[00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:43.850] was
[00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:44.390] hospitalized
[00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.890] less
[00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:45.090] than
[00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:45.370] three
[00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:45.710] years
[00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:46.150] before
[00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.850] the
[00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:47.050] end
[00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:47.170] of
[00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:47.330] our
[00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:47.550] data
[00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:48.010] collection
[00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:48.490] period
[00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:48.770] and
[00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:48.970] so
[00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:49.190] on.
[00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:49.790] And
[00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:49.950] so
[00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:50.130] I
[00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:50.470] avoided
[00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.830] that.
[00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.710] But
[00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.930] what
[00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:52.190] this
[00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.350] is
[00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:52.650] showing
[00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:53.030] you
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.420] is
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:54.820] for
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:55.260] each
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:55.480] of
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:55.840] the
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:56.560] hours
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.020] 0
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:57.340] to
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:58.260] 24,
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:00.060] what
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:00.300] is
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.160] the
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.200] number
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.180] of
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:06.260] measurements?
[00:59:07.650 --> 00:59:07.950] And
[00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:08.570] for
[00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:09.150] each
[00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:09.350] of
[00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:09.650] those
[00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:10.130] hours,
[00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:10.510] what
[00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:10.650] is
[00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:10.850] the
[00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:12.050] fraction
[00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:12.370] of
[00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:12.630] those
[00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:13.090] measurements
[00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:13.610] that's
[00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:14.090] abnormal?
[00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:16.950] So
[00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:17.130] I
[00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:17.330] said,
[00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:17.610] well,
[00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:18.230] let's
[00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.410] just
[00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:18.690] throw
[00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:18.810] it
[00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:19.030] into
[00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.210] a
[00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:19.510] logistic
[00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.970] regression
[00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:20.410] model.
[00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:21.150] And
[00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:21.350] what
[00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:21.630] comes
[00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:21.890] out
[00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:22.050] is
[00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:22.330] something
[00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:22.690] really
[00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:23.090] weird,
[00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:23.710] which
[00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.910] is
[00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:24.190] that
[00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:24.990] a
[00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.250] few
[00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:25.810] particular
[00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:26.390] hours
[00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.710] are
[00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:27.330] significant,
[00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:27.810] but
[00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:28.150] most
[00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.350] of
[00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:28.530] them
[00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:28.670] are
[00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.970] not.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.120] And
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:30.300] that
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:30.580] looks
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:30.880] like
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:31.180] noise
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:31.400] to
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:31.640] me
[00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:34.050] because
[00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:35.150] you
[00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.430] wouldn't
[00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:36.030] expect
[00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:36.510] that
[00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:38.810] at
[00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:39.770] 8
[00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.930] o
[00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:40.070]'clock
[00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:40.270] in
[00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.410] the
[00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:40.750] morning,
[00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:42.710] the
[00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:43.090] fact
[00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:43.350] that
[00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:43.530] you
[00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:43.810] had
[00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:44.370] something
[00:59:44.370 --> 00:59:44.890] measured
[00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:45.830] matters.
[00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:46.830] But
[00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:47.010] at
[00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:47.250] 9

[00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:48.150] morning,
[00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:48.390] it
[00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.870] doesn't.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:50.100] That
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:50.460] doesn't
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:50.720] seem
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.200] sensible.
[00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:52.670] So
[00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.850] I
[00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:52.990] don't

[00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:54.350] here.
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.080] And
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:56.280] in
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:56.580] fact,
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:57.280] when
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:57.460] I
[00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:57.780] looked
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:58.280] at
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.240] the
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:00.540] number
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:00.780] of
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.000] white
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:01.200] blood
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:01.500] count
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:01.940] measurements
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.340] at
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:02.700] night
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.360] and
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:03.740] related
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.040] to
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:04.600] mortality,
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.020] so
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:05.640] false
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.420] means
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:06.800] people
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.240] lived
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:07.500] and
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:07.700] true
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:08.020] means
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:08.260] they
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:08.680] died.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:09.460] But
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:09.620] you
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:09.860] see
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.080] that
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:10.360] there's
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:10.600] not
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:10.740] a
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:10.900] whole
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.140] lot
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:11.300] of
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:11.740] difference
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.160] between
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:12.400] the
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:12.980] distributions.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:13.940] But
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.080] you
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:14.360] also
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:14.640] see
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:14.840] that
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.020] the
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:15.220] number
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:15.440] of
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:15.640] white
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:15.880] blood
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.240] counts
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:16.480] is
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:16.920] relatively
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.480] small
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.140] in
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:18.340] this
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:18.680] database.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.080] And
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:19.240] so
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:19.580] I
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:19.740] think
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:19.920] we
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.120] just
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:20.360] don't
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:20.580] have
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:20.820] enough
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:21.600] data
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.400] to
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.360] do
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:23.560] it.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:24.380] On
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:24.500] the
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:24.680] other
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:24.900] hand,
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:25.100] if
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:25.260] you
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:25.520] look
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:25.640] at
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:25.820] a
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.120] panel
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:26.540] of
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:26.900] different
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.380] drugs,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:28.200] you
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:28.440] look
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:28.600] at
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:28.860] mean
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:29.440] values
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:29.800] of
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.060] blood
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:30.340] urea,
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:30.880] nitrogen,
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:31.220] or
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:31.640] calcium
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.240] chloride,
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.040] CO2,
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:33.260] et
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:33.560] cetera,
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:33.940] you
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:34.480] see
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:34.700] that
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:34.900] there
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:35.100] is
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:35.760] variation
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.000] across
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:37.440] time.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:38.260] So
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.300] there
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:39.560] is
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:40.160] some
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:40.520] sort
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:40.760] of
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.560] variance
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.320] that's
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:42.640] either
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.160] caused
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:43.580] by
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.280] the

[01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:46.060] of

[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:46.880] body
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.280] or
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:47.580] by
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.040] the
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:48.480] routine
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.100] practice
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:49.800] of
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:50.180] medicine
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:50.580] about
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:50.880] when
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.200] people
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:51.560] choose
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:51.780] to
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.020] take
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:52.260] lab
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:52.680] measurements.
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:55.460] And
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:55.700] in
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:56.020] fact,
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:56.400] if
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:56.660] you
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.560] look
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:57.960] at
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:58.500] the
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.420] fraction
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.160] of
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:00.880] high
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.080] and
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:01.320] low
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:01.660] lab
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:02.240] values,
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:02.820] they
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:03.060] do
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:03.380] vary
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:03.660] by
[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.000] hour.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:04.800] And
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:04.980] in
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:05.400] particular,
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:05.940] if
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:06.080] you
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:06.320] look
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:06.480] at
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:06.740] white
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.000] blood
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:07.500] counts,
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.100] you
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:08.440] see
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:08.740] that
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:09.160] the
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.360] fraction
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:10.940] of
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.300] high
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:11.920] values
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.760] goes
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.060] up
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:14.380] at
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:14.680] night
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:15.420] and
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:15.660] the
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.040] fraction
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:16.300] of
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:16.540] low
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:16.980] values
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.320] goes
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:17.600] down
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:17.820] at
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.100] night,
[01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:19.430] which
[01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.630] is
[01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:20.070] consistent
[01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:20.450] with
[01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.630] what
[01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.850] they
[01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:21.150] saw
[01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:21.850] as
[01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:22.130] well.
[01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:23.970] There's
[01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:24.250] another
[01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:24.490] way
[01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:24.670] to
[01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.970] measure
[01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:25.270] it,
[01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.530] which
[01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:25.910] is
[01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:28.010] instead
[01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.290] of
[01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:28.670] using
[01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:29.130] normal
[01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:29.730] ranges,
[01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.330] the
[01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:30.750] lab
[01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:31.230] actually
[01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:31.610] gives
[01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:31.790] you
[01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:31.990] a
[01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.410] call
[01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:32.930] that
[01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:33.330] says,
[01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:33.850] is
[01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:34.070] this
[01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:34.490] value
[01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.030] normal,
[01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:35.370] low,
[01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.550] or
[01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:35.930] high?
[01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:36.750] And
[01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.930] we
[01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:37.130] can
[01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.410] use
[01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:37.770] that.
[01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:39.010] That's
[01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:39.150] a
[01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.290] little
[01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:39.530] bit
[01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.790] more
[01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:40.130] subtle
[01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.570] because
[01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:41.310] it
[01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:41.690] depends
[01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.990] on
[01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.650] calibration
[01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:43.110] of
[01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:43.310] the
[01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:43.710] equipment
[01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:44.470] and
[01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.650] is
[01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:45.070] updated
[01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:45.410] as
[01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:45.590] the
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:46.070] calibration
[01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:46.670] changes.
[01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:47.310] So
[01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:47.610] that's
[01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:47.950] probably
[01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:48.170] a
[01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.310] little
[01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:48.490] bit
[01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:48.730] more
[01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:49.070] accurate.
[01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:49.810] But
[01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:49.970] you
[01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:50.190] see
[01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.630] essentially
[01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.950] the
[01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:51.210] same
[01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:51.610] phenomenon
[01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:52.090] here.
[01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:53.630] But
[01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.970] if
[01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:54.170] you
[01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.450] look
[01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:54.910] at
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.940] the
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:57.600] distributions
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.060] of
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.320] when
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.240] measurements
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:00.640] are
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:00.920] done
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.180] that
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:01.440] turn
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:01.640] out
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:01.800] to
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:01.960] be
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.360] normal
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:02.840] versus
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.220] when
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:03.380] they
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:03.620] turn
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:03.800] out
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:03.960] to
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.120] be
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:04.620] abnormal,
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:05.900] there's
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.060] a
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:06.220] lot
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:06.380] of
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:06.900] similarity
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.380] between
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:07.700] the
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:07.980] normal
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:08.240] and
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:08.380] the
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:08.840] abnormal
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:09.860] curves
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.240] of
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:10.460] when
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:10.720] those
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.140] measurements
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:11.460] are
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:11.780] taken.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:12.880] So
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.800] we're
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.040] not
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:14.340] seeing
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:14.600] that.
[01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:16.050] OK,
[01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:16.770] let
[01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:16.870] me
[01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:17.170] race
[01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:17.370] through
[01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:17.590] to
[01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:17.730] the
[01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:18.050] end.
[01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:19.250] This
[01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:19.430] is
[01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.730] my
[01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:20.150] heartbeat
[01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.590] from
[01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:20.850] my
[01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:21.250] watch.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:23.400] You
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:23.600] can
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.040] actually
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:24.700] download
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.060] the
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:25.440] stuff
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:25.680] and
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.400] put
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:26.500] it
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:26.660] in
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:26.840] your
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.240] favorite
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.000] analysis
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.520] engine
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.100] and
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.040] take
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:30.200] a
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:30.400] look.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:30.620] So
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:30.900] here
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:31.080] I
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:31.280] was
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:31.560] running
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.020] across
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:32.240] the
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:32.500] Harvard
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.020] Bridge.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:33.880] And
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.140] if
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:34.300] you
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:34.520] look
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:34.660] at
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:34.880] my
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.140] heart
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:35.360] rate
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:35.900] variability
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.460] over
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:36.760] the
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.020] 30
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:37.600] seconds
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:37.820] or
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:38.120] so,
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:38.820] you
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:39.100] see
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:39.340] that
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:39.600] the
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.280] interbeat
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:40.960] interval
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.760] ranges
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.220] from
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:42.520] about
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.220] 550
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:43.760] to
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.120] about
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.760] 630,
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.480] 620
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.740] milliseconds.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.100] And
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:51.300] so
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:51.500] you
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:51.660] could
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:52.180] calculate
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:52.560] my
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:52.800] heart
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.040] rate
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:53.540] variability,
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.020] which
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:54.260] is
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:54.540] thought
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:54.760] to
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:55.060] be
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:55.680] an
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.140] indicator
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:56.580] of
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:57.020] heart
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:57.440] health
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:57.640] and
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:57.860] so
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:58.080] on.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:58.760] You
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:58.980] can
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.500] calculate
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:02:59.880] that
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.020] I
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:00.220] was
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:00.520] running
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:00.760] at
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:00.900] a
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:01.160] pace
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:01.340] of
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:01.580] about
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:01.940] 100.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.160] My
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:03.440] heart
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:03.680] was
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:03.940] beating
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:04.200] at
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:04.340] a
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:04.540] pace
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:04.720] of
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:04.960] about
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.280] 100
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:05.600] beats
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:05.880] per
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.140] minute.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:07.840] So
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:08.360] there's
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:08.560] all
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:08.820] sorts
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:08.980] of
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.480] information
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:09.840] like
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.060] that
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:10.480] available.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:12.940] Now,
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:13.460] as
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:13.600] I
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:13.800] said,
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:13.980] I'm
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:14.160] not
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:14.280] going
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:14.360] to
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:14.520] get
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:14.780] into
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.080] this
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:15.460] today.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:15.780] But
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.940] this
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:18.140] was
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:18.300] a
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:18.480] very
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.120] successful
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:19.760] recently
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.280] published
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:20.740] paper
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:21.300] where
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:21.840] they're
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.120] able
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:22.380] to
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:22.660] take
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:22.820] a
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:23.040] look
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:23.900] at
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.160] images
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:25.720] of
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:25.940] the
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.200] lung.
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:26.800] So
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.080] this
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:27.260] is
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:27.440] a
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.000] transverse
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:28.560] scan
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.300] of
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:29.540] the
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.360] lung.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.320] And
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.080] they
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:32.360] have
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:32.600] a
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:32.840] deep
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.140] learning
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:33.820] machine
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:34.300] that
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:34.460] is
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:34.700] able
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:34.960] to
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.480] identify
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.460] these
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:36.720] two
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.040] yellow
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:37.440] marked
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:37.840] things,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:38.040] a
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:38.460] pulmonary
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.060] emboli,
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.040] as
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:40.440] opposed
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:40.700] to
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:40.980] these
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:41.280] other
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:41.760] things
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.020] that
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:42.140] are
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:42.440] just
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:42.840] random
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.400] flecks
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.040] in
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:44.220] the
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:44.520] tissue.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:45.320] And
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:45.540] I
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:45.880] can't
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.020] do
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:46.280] that
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:46.540] by
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:46.960] eyeball.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.000] Maybe
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:48.500] a
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:48.700] good
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.440] radiologist
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:49.780] might
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:49.980] be
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.200] able
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:50.480] to.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:51.460] But
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:51.780] this
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:52.000] is
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:52.380] claimed
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:52.860] in
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:53.020] the
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:53.320] paper
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:53.600] to
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.360] outperform
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.020] decent
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:56.700] radiologists
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.460] already.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:58.300] This
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:58.520] was
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:58.780] one
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:58.920] of
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.120] the
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:03:59.480] articles
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:03:59.920] that
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:00.220] led
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:00.540] Geoff
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:00.860] Hinton
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:01.600] to
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:01.860] make
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.120] this
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:02.400] rather
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:02.880] stupid
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.700] pronouncement
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:03.940] that
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.300] said,
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.700] tell
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:05.960] your
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:06.300] children
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:06.680] not
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:06.880] to
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.200] become
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.020] radiologists
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:08.360] because
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:08.740] the
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:09.220] profession
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:09.560] will
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:09.820] be
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:10.520] over
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.080] by
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:11.280] the
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:11.500] time
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:11.740] they
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.060] get
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:12.380] fully
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:12.760] trained,
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:13.800] which
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:13.940] I
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.120] don't
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:14.640] believe.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:15.220] They
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:15.440] may
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:15.600] do
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:15.960] different
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.420] things.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:16.680] But
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.420] they
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:17.620] won't
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:17.840] go
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.100] away.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:20.980] This
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:21.240] was
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.000] a
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.280] slide
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:22.520] from
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:22.780] Ron
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.320] Kakinas
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.440] at
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:24.600] the
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:24.980] Brigham.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:25.420] And
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:25.680] they're
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.160] using
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.120] automated
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:27.780] techniques
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.340] of
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.840] analyzing
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.240] white
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:30.580] matter
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.020] in
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:31.260] order
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:31.740] to
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:32.540] identify
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.440] lupus
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:33.900] lesions.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:34.260] So
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:34.620] lupus
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:34.820] is
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:34.980] a
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:35.220] bad
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:35.740] disease
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:36.140] that
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:37.720] shows
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.080] up
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:38.720] in
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.180] these
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.300] magnetic

[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:41.340] images
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.540] in
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:42.880] certain
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.300] ways.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:44.980] The
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:45.300] last
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:45.480] thing
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:45.620] I
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:45.760] want
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:45.860] to
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.100] talk
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:46.360] about

[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:46.880] is
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.280] notes.
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:48.560] So
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.260] my
[01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:51.070] students
[01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:51.310] did
[01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:51.450] a
[01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:51.630] little
[01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:52.350] exercise
[01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:53.230] last
[01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:53.670] semester
[01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:54.750] where
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:56.060] we
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:56.360] tried
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:56.580] to
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:56.980] see
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.100] how
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:58.440] good
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:58.760] is
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.040] the
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:04:59.620] average
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:00.000] ape,
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:00.780] namely
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:01.660] member
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:01.880] of
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.100] my
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:02.460] research
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:02.800] group,
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:03.960] at
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:04.500] predicting
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.140] mortality.
[01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:07.430] And
[01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.690] so
[01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:07.910] we
[01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:08.130] took
[01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:08.310] a
[01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:08.490] bunch
[01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:08.670] of
[01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:09.010] cases
[01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:09.490] from
[01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:09.710] the
[01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:09.930] MIMIC
[01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:10.170] data
[01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:10.570] set,
[01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:11.750] blinded
[01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.970] to
[01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:12.190] the
[01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:12.990] question
[01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.250] of
[01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.450] whether
[01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:13.690] the
[01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:14.030] person
[01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.330] lived
[01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:14.530] or
[01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:14.870] died.
[01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.570] We
[01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:15.830] gave
[01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:16.010] the
[01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:16.250] data
[01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.470] to

[01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:20.350] I
[01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:20.630] showed
[01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.810] you
[01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:21.130] earlier,
[01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:21.850] that
[01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:22.630] summarizes
[01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:23.130] the

[01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:24.470] and
[01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.910] then
[01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:25.370] also
[01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:25.730] gave

[01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:30.410] cases
[01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:31.070] to
[01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:31.350] see
[01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:31.630] whether
[01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:32.050] people
[01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:32.370] could
[01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:32.830] predict
[01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:33.690] better
[01:05:33.690 --> 01:05:34.070] than
[01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:34.330] a

[01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:36.150] whether
[01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.670] somebody
[01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.950] was

[01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.950] die.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.260] And
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:39.440] the
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:39.720] answer
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:40.060] is,
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:40.760] yes,
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:41.340] slightly
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:41.760] better.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.120] Not
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:43.760] immensely
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:44.180] better,
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:44.880] but
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.240] slightly
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:45.600] better.
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:46.360] And
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.000] furthermore,
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:47.360] it
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:47.700] looks
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.160] like
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:48.900] by
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.240] giving
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:49.480] them
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.080] feedback,
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:50.500] so
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:50.780] as
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.100] they're
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:51.740] looking
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:51.980] at
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:52.200] these
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:52.600] cases
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.040] and
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:53.300] trying
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:53.500] to
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:53.680] make
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:53.860] the
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.260] prediction,
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:55.120] they
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:55.340] make
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:55.480] a
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:55.820] prediction.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:56.080] You
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:56.260] tell
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:56.380] them
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:56.520] if
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:56.640] they
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:56.800] were
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:57.020] right
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:57.160] or
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:57.520] wrong.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:58.900] We
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:05:59.240] learn.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.160] And
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:00.340] so
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:00.500] we
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:00.700] get
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:01.100] slightly
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:01.580] better
[01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:02.600] than
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.020] slightly
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:03.420] better
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:03.700] than
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.020] random.
[01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.950] It
[01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:06.070] was
[01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:06.310] kind
[01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:06.410] of
[01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:06.790] interesting.
[01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:07.670] OK.
[01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:09.130] So
[01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:09.770] one
[01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.890] of
[01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:10.030] the
[01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:10.250] things
[01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:10.430] I
[01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.910] discovered
[01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:11.450] is
[01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.690] that
[01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:12.010] at
[01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:12.210] least
[01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:12.430] when
[01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:12.590] I
[01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:12.810] was
[01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:13.390] playing
[01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.590] the
[01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:13.830] monkey
[01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:14.110] in
[01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:14.350] this
[01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:15.050] exercise,
[01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:16.170] I
[01:06:16.170 --> 01:06:16.530] found
[01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:16.790] the
[01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:17.070] notes
[01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:17.310] to
[01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:17.510] be
[01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.910] immensely
[01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:18.470] useful,
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:19.580] much
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:19.880] more
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:20.340] useful
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:20.680] than
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:20.900] the
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:21.160] trend
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:21.600] lines
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.380] of
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:22.840] laboratory
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.300] data.
[01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:25.110] Partly
[01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:25.370] it's
[01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.510] because
[01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.770] I'm
[01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:25.930] used
[01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:26.130] to
[01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:26.350] reading
[01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:26.890] English.
[01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:27.570] I'm
[01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:27.770] not
[01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.950] so
[01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:28.170] used
[01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:28.370] to
[01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.710] reading
[01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:29.970] graphs
[01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:30.230] of
[01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.670] laboratory
[01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:31.130] data.
[01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:32.150] But
[01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.450] part
[01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:32.570] of
[01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:32.710] it
[01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.910] is
[01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:33.110] that
[01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:33.290] there
[01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:33.390] is
[01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.710] a
[01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:34.030] level
[01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:34.250] of
[01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:34.550] human
[01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:35.210] understanding
[01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.530] that
[01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:35.770] is
[01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:36.370] transmitted
[01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:37.370] in
[01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.730] the
[01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:38.130] nursing
[01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:38.570] notes
[01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:38.810] and
[01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:38.970] in
[01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:39.110] the
[01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:39.490] discharge
[01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:40.010] summaries
[01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.210] and
[01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:40.450] so
[01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:40.670] on
[01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:41.330] that
[01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:41.510] you
[01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.790] don't
[01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:42.090] get
[01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:42.370] from
[01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:42.670] just
[01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:43.010] looking
[01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:43.230] at
[01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.450] raw
[01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:43.790] data.
[01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:44.490] And
[01:06:44.490 --> 01:06:44.810] so
[01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:45.310] there
[01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:45.530] is
[01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:45.770] very
[01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:46.090] much
[01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:46.350] the
[01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:46.810] sense,
[01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:47.290] which
[01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:47.510] we're
[01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.610] going
[01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:47.710] to
[01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:47.970] talk
[01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:48.250] about
[01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:48.390] in
[01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.530] a
[01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:48.690] couple
[01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:48.930] of
[01:06:48.930 --> 01:06:49.190] weeks,
[01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:50.090] of
[01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:50.650] how
[01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:51.070] can
[01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:51.370] we
[01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:51.870] take
[01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:52.670] advantage
[01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:53.530] of
[01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:53.750] that
[01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:54.310] information,
[01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:55.410] extract
[01:06:55.410 --> 01:06:55.770] it,
[01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:56.010] and
[01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:56.330] use
[01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:56.490] it
[01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:56.630] in
[01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.790] the
[01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:57.010] kinds
[01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:57.170] of
[01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.490] modeling
[01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:57.750] that
[01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.910] we
[01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:58.110] want
[01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:58.210] to
[01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:58.370] do.
[01:06:58.990 --> 01:06:59.230] So
[01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.430] in
[01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.770] MIMIC,
[01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:00.030] if
[01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:00.190] you
[01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.470] look,
[01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:01.050] we
[01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:01.330] have
[01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:02.090] nursing
[01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:02.510] notes
[01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.690] and
[01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:03.350] radiology
[01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:03.850] reports
[01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:04.270] and
[01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:04.570] more
[01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:04.990] nursing
[01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.430] notes
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.310] and
[01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:07.330] electrocardiogram
[01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:08.010] reports
[01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:08.330] and
[01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:09.030] doctor's
[01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:09.310] notes
[01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:09.570] and
[01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:09.950] discharge
[01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:10.470] summaries
[01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.830] and
[01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:12.970] echocardiograms,
[01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:13.450] respiratory,
[01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:13.930] et
[01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:14.210] cetera.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.340] And
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:16.520] if
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:16.660] you
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:16.880] look
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.100] at
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:17.600] the
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.320] distribution
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.040] of
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:19.300] the
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:19.680] length
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.060] of
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:20.420] these,
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:21.960] these
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.120] are
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:22.680] unfortunately
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.200] not
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:23.380] on
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:23.520] the
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:23.760] same
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.180] scale.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.000] But
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:25.220] the
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:25.620] discharge
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:26.060] summary
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:26.380] is
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:26.560] the
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:26.760] thing
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.080] that's
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:27.360] written
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:27.820] at
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:28.000] the
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:28.240] time
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:28.420] you
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:28.660] leave
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:28.840] the
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:29.240] hospital.
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:30.060] So
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:30.320] this
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:30.460] is
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:30.680] sort
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:30.780] of
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.000] the
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:31.360] summary
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:31.740] of
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:32.060] everything
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:32.280] that
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:32.660] happened
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:32.900] to
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:33.100] you
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:33.540] during
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:33.740] your
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:34.580] hospitalization.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:35.460] And
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:35.680] it's
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.100] long.
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:36.680] So
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.400] it
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:37.660] goes
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:37.880] up
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.120] to
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:38.380] like
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:38.740] 30
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:39.220],000
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.060] characters.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:41.820] It's
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:42.500] a
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:42.900] small,
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:43.860] it's
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:43.960] a
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:44.180] short
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:44.600] story,
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:45.500] not
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.000] so
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:46.400] short,
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:46.680] short
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.100] story.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:48.680] Nursing
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.060] notes
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:49.300] tend
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:49.500] to
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:49.700] be
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.060] shorter.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:50.740] They
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:50.960] run
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:51.140] up
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:51.300] to
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:51.540] about
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:51.860] 3
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.260],000
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:52.780] characters.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:53.720] This
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:54.020] other
[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:54.300] set
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:54.460] of
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:54.800] nursing
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:55.220] notes,
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:55.500] which
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:55.640] I
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:55.840] think
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.360] comes
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:56.600] from
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:56.760] the
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.000] other
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:57.500] system,
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:58.100] is
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:58.240] a
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:58.380] little
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:58.600] bit
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:58.980] longer.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:07:59.160] It
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:07:59.340] goes
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:07:59.540] up
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:07:59.700] to
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:07:59.940] about
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.280] 5
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:00.780],000.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.140] Doctor's
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:02.420] notes
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:02.720] are
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:02.860] a
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:02.980] little
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:03.200] bit
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:03.500] longer
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:03.860] yet.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:04.100] They
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:04.320] go
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:04.500] up
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:04.640] to
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:04.900] about
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.180] 10
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:05.200],000,
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:05.540] 15
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:05.980],000
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:07.060] characters
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:07.720] typically.
[01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:09.210] And
[01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:09.590] there
[01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:09.730] are
[01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:10.050] various
[01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:10.410] other
[01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:10.730] kinds
[01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.910] of
[01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:11.170] notes.
[01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:11.930] So
[01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:12.050] I
[01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:12.250] just
[01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:12.490] wanted
[01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:12.710] to
[01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.930] show
[01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:13.090] you
[01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:13.270] a
[01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.430] few
[01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.630] of
[01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:13.870] these.
[01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.650] Here's
[01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:14.790] a
[01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:15.050] brief
[01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:15.490] nursing
[01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:15.830] note.
[01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.270] So
[01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:16.530] this
[01:08:16.530 --> 01:08:16.690] is
[01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:16.870] a
[01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:17.290] patient
[01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:17.910] who
[01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:18.090] is
[01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:18.770] hypotensive
[01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:19.090] but
[01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:19.330] not
[01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:19.550] in
[01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.930] shock.
[01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:21.370] Patient
[01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:21.930] remains
[01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:22.330] on
[01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:22.570] this
[01:08:22.570 --> 01:08:22.930] drug
[01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:23.310] drip
[01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:23.690] at
[01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:23.970] 0
[01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:24.750].75
[01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.190] micrograms
[01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:26.410] per
[01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:26.830] kilogram
[01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:27.190] per
[01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:27.490] minute.
[01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:28.170] No
[01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:28.730] titration
[01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:29.150] needed
[01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.390] at
[01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.610] this
[01:08:29.610 --> 01:08:29.930] time.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:30.610] Their
[01:08:30.610 --> 01:08:30.870] blood
[01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:31.230] pressure
[01:08:31.230 --> 01:08:31.510] is
[01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.850] stable
[01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:32.090] at
[01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:32.310] more
[01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:32.510] than
[01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.870] 100.
[01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:33.250] The
[01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:33.410] mean
[01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.930] arterial
[01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:34.290] pressure
[01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:34.570] is
[01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:35.230] 65,
[01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:35.870] greater
[01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:36.130] than
[01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:36.870] 65.
[01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:38.530] Wean
[01:08:38.530 --> 01:08:38.750] them
[01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:39.090] from
[01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:39.370] this
[01:08:39.370 --> 01:08:39.690] drug,
[01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:40.230] presumably,
[01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.890] if
[01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:41.390] it's
[01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:42.090] tolerated.
[01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.610] Wound
[01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:44.250] infection.
[01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:45.510] So
[01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:46.130] anterior
[01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.750] groin
[01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:47.130] area
[01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:47.590] open
[01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.850] and
[01:08:47.850 --> 01:08:48.370] oozing.
[01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.450] Moderate
[01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:50.090] amounts
[01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.330] of
[01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:50.590] thin
[01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:51.470] pink
[01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:52.090]-tinged
[01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:52.530] serous
[01:08:52.530 --> 01:08:52.910] fluid.
[01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.950] Patient
[01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:54.530] stooling
[01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:54.770] with
[01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:55.090] small
[01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:55.390] amounts
[01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:55.630] of
[01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.930] stool
[01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:56.390] on
[01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:57.510] something
[01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.830] and
[01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:58.550] dangerously
[01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.910] close
[01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:59.090] to
[01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.250] the
[01:08:59.250 --> 01:08:59.550] open
[01:08:59.550 --> 01:08:59.990] wound,
[01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:00.590] et
[01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.890] cetera.
[01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:01.210] So
[01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:01.450] this
[01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:01.630] is
[01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:01.830] sort
[01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:01.970] of
[01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:02.170] the
[01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:02.990] nurse's
[01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.810] snapshot.
[01:09:04.230 --> 01:09:04.370] She
[01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:04.650] just
[01:09:04.650 --> 01:09:04.930] went
[01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:05.210] in,
[01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:05.770] saw
[01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:05.990] the
[01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.470] patient.
[01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:07.190] By
[01:09:07.190 --> 01:09:07.270] the
[01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:07.370] way,
[01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.550] I
[01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.790] say
[01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:08.150] she,
[01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:08.570] but
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.300] probably
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:10.640] a
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.100] vast
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:11.520] majority
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:11.820] of
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:12.140] nurses
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:12.720] in
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.180] Boston
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:13.500] area
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.080] hospitals
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:14.780] really
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:15.020] are
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:15.320] women.
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:15.720] But
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:15.920] there
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.100] are
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:16.360] some
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:16.600] male
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:16.980] nurses.
[01:09:18.930 --> 01:09:19.490] And
[01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:19.910] we'll
[01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:20.490] record
[01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.050] sort
[01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:21.170] of
[01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:21.330] a
[01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:21.670] snapshot
[01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:22.010] of
[01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.270] what's
[01:09:22.270 --> 01:09:22.470] going
[01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.710] on
[01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:22.870] with
[01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:23.010] the
[01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:23.410] patient.
[01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:24.230] What
[01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:24.350] are
[01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:24.530] the
[01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:25.010] concerns?
[01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:25.910] In
[01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:26.410] principle,
[01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:26.890] this
[01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:27.070] is
[01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.290] going
[01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:27.510] to
[01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.690] be
[01:09:27.690 --> 01:09:28.090] useful
[01:09:28.090 --> 01:09:28.350] not
[01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:28.810] only
[01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:29.230] as
[01:09:29.230 --> 01:09:29.570] a
[01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.930] part
[01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:30.050] of
[01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.190] the
[01:09:30.190 --> 01:09:30.450] medical
[01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:30.910] record,
[01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.610] but
[01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.930] also
[01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:32.190] when
[01:09:32.190 --> 01:09:32.430] this
[01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.690] nurse
[01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:32.990] goes
[01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.270] off
[01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:33.630] shift
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:34.310] and
[01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:34.530] the
[01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:34.750] next
[01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:35.050] nurse
[01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:35.350] comes
[01:09:35.350 --> 01:09:35.650] on
[01:09:35.650 --> 01:09:36.010] shift,
[01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:36.730] then
[01:09:36.730 --> 01:09:36.970] this
[01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:37.130] is
[01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.270] a
[01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:37.670] recording
[01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:38.050] of
[01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:38.250] what
[01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:38.450] the
[01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.710] state
[01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:38.850] of
[01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:38.990] the
[01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.290] patient
[01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:39.650] was
[01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:39.830] the
[01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:40.050] last
[01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:40.270] time
[01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:40.450] they
[01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:40.610] were
[01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.870] seen
[01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:41.150] by
[01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.950] the
[01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:42.290] nurse.
[01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:43.370] In
[01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.910] reality,
[01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.270] the
[01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:44.510] nurses
[01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.870] tend
[01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:45.090] to
[01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:45.330] tell
[01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:45.550] each
[01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:45.790] other
[01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:46.270] verbally
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.230] rather
[01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:47.630] than
[01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:48.110] relying
[01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.370] on
[01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:48.510] the
[01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:48.750] written
[01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:49.190] version.
[01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:51.050] I
[01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.430] remember
[01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.730] one
[01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:51.970] time
[01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:52.370] talking
[01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.650] to
[01:09:52.650 --> 01:09:52.850] a
[01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:53.110] nurse
[01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.410] in
[01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:53.590] an
[01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.950] intensive
[01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:54.290] care
[01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:54.650] unit
[01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.970] in
[01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:55.650] another
[01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:55.950] part
[01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:56.050] of
[01:09:56.050 --> 01:09:56.190] the
[01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:56.490] country.
[01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:56.690] And
[01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:56.830] I
[01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:57.070] said,
[01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:57.330] so
[01:09:57.330 --> 01:09:58.050] whoever
[01:09:58.050 --> 01:09:58.550] reads
[01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.790] your
[01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:59.210] notes?
[01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:00.130] And
[01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:00.350] she
[01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.810] says,
[01:10:01.450 --> 01:10:03.710] quality
[01:10:03.710 --> 01:10:04.330] assurance
[01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:04.930] officers.
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.320] So
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:06.780] the
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.260] hospital
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:07.700] has
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.380] people
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.000] responsible
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:09.400] for
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:09.700] trying
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:09.940] to
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.260] assess
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:10.480] the
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:10.760] quality
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:11.000] of
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:11.200] care
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:11.420] they're
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:11.760] giving,
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:12.980] and
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:13.420] lawyers
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:13.780] when
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:14.040] there's
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:14.180] a
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:14.500] lawsuit.
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:16.080] And
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:16.280] she
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:16.520] was
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:16.780] very
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.180] happy
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:17.540] because
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:17.900] she
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:18.120] had
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:18.480] saved
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:18.680] the
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.100] hospital
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:19.480] $10
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:19.820] million
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.100] by
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:21.520] having
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.060] carefully
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:22.720] recorded
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.160] that
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:23.520] some
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.280] procedure
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:24.620] had
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:24.880] been
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.180] done
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:25.340] to
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:25.600] a
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.020] patient
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:26.640] who
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:26.880] then
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.100] had
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:27.240] a
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:27.460] bad
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:27.820] outcome
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:28.100] and
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:28.320] was
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:28.640] suing
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:28.820] the
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:29.260] hospital
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:30.180] for
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:30.840] their
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:31.320] neglect
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:31.560] in
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:31.800] not
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.080] having
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:32.360] done
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:32.700] this.
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:33.280] But
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:33.640] because
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:33.900] it
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.100] was
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:34.280] in
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:34.420] the
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:34.720] note,
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:35.400] that
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:35.580] was
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:35.920] proof
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.180] that
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:36.300] it
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:36.660] actually
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:36.920] had
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.120] been
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:37.480] done,
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:37.940] and
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:38.400] therefore
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:38.640] the
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.100] hospital
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.140] wasn't
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:40.560] liable.
[01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:43.490] But
[01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.770] there's
[01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:43.910] a
[01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:44.070] lot
[01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.190] of
[01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:44.690] information
[01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:45.010] in
[01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:45.190] here.
[01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.370] Now,
[01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.650] I'm
[01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:46.730] going
[01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:46.830] to
[01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:47.070] show
[01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.390] you
[01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.090] many
[01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:48.510] pages
[01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:49.010] of
[01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.170] a
[01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:49.510] typical
[01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:50.070] discharge
[01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.450] summary.
[01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:51.210] So
[01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:51.430] this
[01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.590] is
[01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.910] somebody
[01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:52.170] on
[01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:52.330] the
[01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:52.650] surgery
[01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:53.310] service
[01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:54.970] who
[01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:55.390] came
[01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.650] in
[01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:56.170] complaining
[01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:56.450] of
[01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.790] leg
[01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:57.910] pain,
[01:10:58.710 --> 01:10:59.670] redness,
[01:10:59.850 --> 01:10:59.990] and
[01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.430] swelling
[01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:01.010] secondary
[01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.390] to
[01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.950] infection
[01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:02.910] of
[01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:04.290] left
[01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:04.970] femoral
[01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:06.450] popliteal
[01:11:06.450 --> 01:11:06.930] bypass.
[01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:07.810] So
[01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:08.030] she
[01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.290] had
[01:11:08.290 --> 01:11:08.830] surgery.
[01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:10.070] I
[01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.250] think
[01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.530] she,
[01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.910] yeah,
[01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.290] female.
[01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.990] She
[01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.270] had
[01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.730] surgery,
[01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:13.330] which
[01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:13.830] didn't
[01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:14.070] heal
[01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.450] well.
[01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:15.650] So
[01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:16.710] major
[01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:17.170] surgical
[01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:17.450] or

[01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.370] incision

[01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.930] drainage
[01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:20.230] and
[01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:20.510] pulse

[01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:23.170] left

[01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.830] knee
[01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:25.550] popliteal
[01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:26.050] site,
[01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:27.090] incisions
[01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:27.610] with
[01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:28.870] exploration

[01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:30.370] graft
[01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.590] and
[01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:32.190] excision
[01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:32.450] of
[01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:32.670] the
[01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:33.030] entire
[01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.390] left
[01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.790] common

[01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:37.370] blah.
[01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.630] So
[01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:37.870] this
[01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:38.010] is
[01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:38.190] what

[01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:17.070] OK?
[01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:18.010] So
[01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:18.330] that's
[01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:18.530] just

[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:31.240] There
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:31.680] are
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.060] people.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:33.160] Henry
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:33.460] Chui
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:33.800] at

[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:35.780] years
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:36.180] building
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:36.440] a
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:36.780] system
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:37.520] that
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:37.780] had
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.520] autocomplete
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:38.940] and
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:39.200] so
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:39.420] on.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:40.240] And
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:40.780] some
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:41.220] doctors
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:41.640] liked
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:41.860] it,
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:42.060] and
[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:42.260] some
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:42.680] doctors
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:43.020] hated
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:43.360] it.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:43.980] And
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:44.600] the
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.360] MGH
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.140] threw
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:46.440] out
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:46.800] all

[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.220] in
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:48.420] order
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:48.680] to

[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:49.280] Epic.
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:50.460] And
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:50.660] so
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:50.880] it's
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.180] gone.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:51.520] It
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:51.600] was
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:51.780] like
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:52.040] 10

[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:53.300] drain.
[01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.490] But
[01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:54.610] it
[01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:54.770] was
[01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:55.030] not
[01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.210] a
[01:12:55.210 --> 01:12:55.690] spectacular
[01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:56.510] success.
[01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:58.110] Because
[01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:58.630] whenever
[01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.850] you
[01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:59.090] have
[01:12:59.090 --> 01:12:59.990] autocomplete,
[01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:00.670] you
[01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:00.910] have
[01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:01.070] to
[01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.590] anticipate
[01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:02.070] every
[01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.530] possible
[01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:02.970] answer.
[01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:03.890] And
[01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:04.150] people
[01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:04.370] are
[01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:04.610] very
[01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:05.050] creative,
[01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:05.370] and
[01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:05.530] they
[01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:05.830] always
[01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:06.030] want
[01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.150] to
[01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:06.350] type
[01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.770] something
[01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:07.070] that
[01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.250] you
[01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.430] didn't
[01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.990] anticipate.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.500] So
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.020] it's
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:10.220] hard
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:10.480] to
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:10.840] support
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:11.020] it.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:11.820] What
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:12.040] is
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:12.420] Epic?
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:13.480] Epic
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:13.780] is
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:14.000] a
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:14.220] big
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:14.600] company
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:14.960] that
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.520] has
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:15.740] been
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:16.060] winning
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:16.360] all
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:16.520] the
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:16.840] recent
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.520] contests
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:17.900] for
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:18.600] installing
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:19.680] electronic

[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:20.960] systems.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:21.940] Remember,
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:22.160] in
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:22.320] my
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:22.620] last
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:22.980] lecture,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:23.240] I
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:23.500] showed
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:23.720] that
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:23.940] we're
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.320] reaching

[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:25.340]%
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:25.980] saturation.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:26.980] So
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:27.320] they've
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:27.520] been
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:27.840] winning
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.020] a
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:28.220] lot
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.280] of

[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:32.960] deals.
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:34.500] And
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:34.700] they're
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:34.960] getting

[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:35.420] of
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:35.580] the
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:36.100] subsidy.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:38.580] The
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:38.960] estimate
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:39.220] I
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:39.480] heard
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:39.780] was

[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:43.600] and
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:43.740] a
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:43.920] couple
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.080] of
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:44.280] other
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:44.800] hospitals
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:45.700] spent
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:46.060] somewhere
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:46.320] on
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:46.460] the
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:46.740] order
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:47.200] of
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:47.460] $2
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:47.900] billion
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.240] installing
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:49.480] the
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:49.860] system.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:51.000] So
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:51.220] that
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:51.680] included
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.000] all
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:52.160] the
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:52.960] customizations,
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:53.400] and
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:53.540] all
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:53.700] the
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.040] training,
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:54.480] and
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:54.920] all
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.220] the
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:55.820] administrative
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:56.280] stuff
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:56.520] that
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:56.720] went
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:56.980] with
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:57.180] it.
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:57.720] But
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:57.980] that's
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:58.100] a
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:58.400] huge
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:58.660] amount
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:13:58.840] of
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.080] money.
[01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:03.310] So
[01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.630] we
[01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:03.830] have
[01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:04.190] past
[01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:04.550] medical
[01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:05.090] history.
[01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:06.610] One
[01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:06.910] pack
[01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:07.030] a

[01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.590] but
[01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.870] says
[01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:11.050] she
[01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:11.630] stopped
[01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:11.970] six

[01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:12.570] ago,
[01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:12.870] has

[01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:14.050] type
[01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:14.230] 2
[01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:14.790] diabetes.
[01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:16.430] Social
[01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.910] history,
[01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.570] family
[01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:18.110] history,
[01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:20.230] these
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:23.280] are
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:23.480] the

[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:24.860] results.
[01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:27.510] So
[01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.710] it's
[01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:27.990] giving

[01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.750] of
[01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:29.330] information
[01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.970] about

[01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:34.250] bottom.
[01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.730] Pertinent
[01:14:35.730 --> 01:14:36.070] lab
[01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.670] results.
[01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:37.130] So
[01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.370] these
[01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:37.570] are
[01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:37.950] copied
[01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:38.250] out
[01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:38.370] of

[01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:39.490] tables.
[01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:39.910] Yeah.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:42.180] Sorry.

[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:44.700] back.
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:45.100] Yeah.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:45.440] It
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:45.900] said,
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:48.300] so
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:48.480] it
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:48.760] has
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.040] the
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:49.500] fake
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:50.740] dates
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:51.140] of

[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:52.520] up
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:52.780] there.
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:53.200] Yeah.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:53.600] So
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:53.780] the
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:54.020] fact
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:54.240] that

[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:54.540] is
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:54.660] a

[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.520] 2197
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:56.800] would
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:56.940] mean
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:57.400] a
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:57.600] year
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:57.900] ago,
[01:14:57.980 --> 01:14:58.080] so
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:58.400] that's
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:58.620] the
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:14:59.560] medication.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:00.620] Yeah,

[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:46.120] number
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:46.400] to
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:46.740] schedule

[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:48.440] and

[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.240] in
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:53.460] two
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:53.740] weeks.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:16:59.660] I
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:16:59.820] think
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:00.060] this
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:00.220] is
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:00.400] the

[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:00.840] one.
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:02.160] So
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:02.620] just
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:02.920] a
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:03.580] couple
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:03.780] of

[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:06.460] So
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:06.660] you
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:07.100] saw
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:07.560] in

[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:11.480] is
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:11.760] a

[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:12.500] method
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:12.760] of

[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:14.900] that
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:15.160] we
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:15.440] were

[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:17.960] There's
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:18.260] a

[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:31.500] Me
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:31.720] too.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.160] And
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:34.800] ODYSSEY
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:35.080] doesn't

[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:36.440] very
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:36.660] well
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:36.860] yet.
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:37.720] Well,
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.060] so
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.420] what
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:39.860] always
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:40.320] happens,
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:40.600] as
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:40.720] you
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:40.940] say,
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:41.140] I'm
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:41.240] going
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:41.340] to
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:41.740] adopt
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:42.000] this

[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.680] asterisk
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.340] with

[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:45.560] extensions.
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:46.580] And
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:46.860] that's
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:47.140] probably
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:47.460] what's
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:47.580] going
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:47.660] to
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:47.940] happen.
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:48.660] But
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:48.840] it
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:49.100] means
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:49.400] that
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:49.780] the

[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:56.040] like
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:56.400] that,
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:56.920] are
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:57.260] likely
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:57.580] to
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:57.820] wind
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:58.040] up

[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:03.400] You
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:03.620] should
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:03.900] also
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:04.200] know
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:04.460] about

[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:17.200] it.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:18.840] So
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:19.680] FHIR
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:20.080] is
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:20.320] a
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:20.760] gross
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.580] simplification
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:21.940] of
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:22.260] that
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.060] that
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:23.440] starts
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:23.780] off
[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:24.020] and
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:24.340] says,
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:24.780] if
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:25.140] a
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:25.440] doctor
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.100] refers
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:26.320] a
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:26.540] new
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:26.900] patient
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:27.240] to
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:27.520] you,
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:28.660] what
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:28.820] is
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:29.040] the
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:29.300] minimum
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:29.680] set
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:29.840] of
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:30.100] data
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:30.400] that
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:30.540] you
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:30.760] need
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:30.940] to
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:31.220] know
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:31.720] in
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:31.920] order
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:32.180] to
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:32.420] take
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:32.600] care
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:32.740] of
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:32.920] that
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:33.340] person?
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:33.540] And
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.520] FHIR
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:34.980] tries
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:35.240] to
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:35.720] provide
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:36.220] just
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:36.600] that
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.020] subset
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:37.580] of
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:37.760] all
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:37.920] the
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.200] data.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:39.780] It
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:40.020] has
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:40.380] become
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:40.640] a
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.000] standard
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:41.500] mainly
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.040] because
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:42.900] after
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:43.340] Congress
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:43.720] spent
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.200] $42
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:44.600] billion
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.200] or
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:45.600] so
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.620] bribing
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:46.980] people
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:47.320] into
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:47.640] buying
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:47.940] these
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:48.420] information
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:49.020] systems,
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:49.740] they
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:49.980] got
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:50.320] mad
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:50.520] that
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:50.740] the
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:51.180] information
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:51.780] systems
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:52.040] they
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:52.380] bought
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.040] couldn't
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:53.280] talk
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:53.460] to
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:53.660] each
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:53.900] other.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:54.760] And
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:54.960] so
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:55.160] they
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:55.560] called
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:55.840] in
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:56.160] on
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:56.360] the
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:56.640] carpet
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.060] the
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:57.320] heads
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:57.520] of
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:57.900] these
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:58.840] IT
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.420] companies,
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:19:59.760] health
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.040] IT
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:00.600] companies.
[01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:01.380] And
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:01.620] they
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:01.880] yelled
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:02.080] at
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:02.340] them,
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:02.500] and
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:02.660] they
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:02.880] made
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.080] them
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:03.500] promise
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:03.820] that
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:04.020] there
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:04.220] would
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:04.400] be
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.380] interoperability.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.460] They
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:07.000] promised,
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:07.380] and
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:07.680] out
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:07.840] of
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.080] that
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:08.420] came
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:08.880] FHIR.
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:09.920] It
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.140] was
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:10.580] probably
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:11.680] simultaneously
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:12.420] developed,
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:12.700] but
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:12.880] they
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.300] adopted
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:13.620] it.
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:14.380] And
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:14.620] so
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:15.100] now,
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:15.800] in
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.280] principle,
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:16.880] it's
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.340] possible
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:17.660] to
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:18.200] exchange
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:18.560] data
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.000] between
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:19.460] different
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:20.020] hospitals
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:20.760] at
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.020] least
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:21.220] to
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:21.400] the
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:21.660] level
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:22.080] of
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:22.320] that
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:22.780] degree
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:23.240] of
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:24.320] harmonization
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:24.880] of
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.040] the
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:25.300] data.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:26.340] In
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:26.900] reality,
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:27.680] the
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.280] companies
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:28.700] don't
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.060] want
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:29.200] you
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:29.380] to
[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:29.580] do
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:29.900] that
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:30.380] because
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.200] they
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:31.540] like
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:31.780] there
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:32.000] to
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:32.200] be
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:32.640] friction
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.400] in
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:33.640] not
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:33.920] being
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:34.160] able
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:34.400] to
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:34.680] take
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:34.880] all
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:35.040] your
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:35.340] data
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:35.580] to
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:35.740] a
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:36.000] different
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:36.500] hospital
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:36.920] because
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.220] it
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:37.680] is
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:37.900] more
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:38.260] likely
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:38.540] to
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:38.780] leave
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:39.000] you
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:39.380] at
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:39.520] the
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:39.700] one
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:39.900] that
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:40.100] you're
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:40.340] at.
[01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:41.690] So
[01:20:41.690 --> 01:20:42.050] there's
[01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.870] complicated
[01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:44.430] socioeconomic
[01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:44.930] kinds
[01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:45.110] of
[01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.470] issues
[01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.810] in
[01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:45.990] all
[01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.290] this.
[01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:46.910] But
[01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:47.090] at
[01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:47.270] least
[01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.510] the
[01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.850] standard
[01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:48.490] exists
[01:20:48.490 --> 01:20:48.730] and
[01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:48.890] is
[01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:49.330] becoming
[01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:49.650] more
[01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:49.810] and
[01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:49.990] more
[01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.470] widely
[01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:51.430] deployed
[01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.670] as
[01:20:51.670 --> 01:20:51.890] long
[01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:52.090] as
[01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:52.430] Congress
[01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.770] pays
[01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:53.170] attention.
[01:20:53.710 --> 01:20:54.050] It's
[01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.390] ugly.
[01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:55.070] So
[01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.510] here's
[01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.670] what
[01:20:55.670 --> 01:20:55.830] a
[01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:56.130] patient
[01:20:56.130 --> 01:20:56.530] looks
[01:20:56.530 --> 01:20:56.910] like.
[01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:58.320] It's
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:58.520] the
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.000] usual
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:20:59.800] unreadable
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.240] XML
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:00.820] garbage.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:02.020] But
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:02.720] fortunately,
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:03.200] there
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:03.380] are

[01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:19.130] Harmonization
[01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:19.490] is
[01:22:19.490 --> 01:22:19.950] difficult
[01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:20.230] and
[01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:20.490] time
[01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:20.950] consuming.
[01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.270] And
[01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.430] there
[01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.550] are
[01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.790] lots

[01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:22.470] for

[01:22:22.690 --> 01:22:22.870] we
[01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:23.070] just
[01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.290] don't

[01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:24.730] And
[01:22:24.730 --> 01:22:24.910] so
[01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:25.350] everybody
[01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.890] develops
[01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:26.130] their

[01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.310] I

[01:22:33.850 --> 01:22:33.970] he
[01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:34.270] spent
[01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.570] about
[01:22:34.570 --> 01:22:34.870] half
[01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:35.050] his

[01:22:37.330 --> 01:22:37.790] And
[01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.950] I
[01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:38.170] gave
[01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:38.390] that
[01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.690] thesis
[01:22:38.690 --> 01:22:39.150] to

[01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.790] who
[01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:41.130] started
[01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:41.370] a
[01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:41.530] few
[01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:41.770] years
[01:22:41.770 --> 01:22:42.110] later
[01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.730] who
[01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:42.970] read
[01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:43.150] it.
[01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:43.310] And
[01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.390] he
[01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.650] comes
[01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:43.830] to
[01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:44.130] me
[01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:44.490] with
[01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:45.070] just
[01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.650] awestruck.
[01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:46.350] And
[01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:46.530] he
[01:22:46.530 --> 01:22:46.830] says,
[01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:47.150] what?
[01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.430] He
[01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.790] only
[01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:48.210] spent
[01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:48.530] half
[01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.710] his
[01:22:48.710 --> 01:22:48.990] time
[01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:49.350] cleaning
[01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.710] the
[01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:50.010] data?
[01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:51.830] And
[01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:52.470] unfortunately,
[01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.650] that's
[01:22:53.650 --> 01:22:53.950] roughly
[01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:54.270] where
[01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:54.470] we
[01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.730] are
[01:22:54.730 --> 01:22:55.050] in
[01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:55.270] this
[01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.570] field.
[01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:56.110] So
[01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:57.150] sorry
[01:22:57.150 --> 01:22:57.350] to
[01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.510] be
[01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.670] a
[01:22:57.670 --> 01:22:58.050] downer,
[01:22:58.170 --> 01:22:58.290] but
[01:22:58.290 --> 01:22:58.990] that's
[01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.150] the
[01:22:59.150 --> 01:22:59.390] current
[01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.750] state
[01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.910] of

[01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:01.230] And
[01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:01.470] next
[01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:01.710] time,
[01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:02.010] David
[01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:02.250] will
