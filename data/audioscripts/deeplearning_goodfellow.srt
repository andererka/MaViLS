[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.140] presentation.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.060] This
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.480] presentation
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.940] covers
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.280] the

[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.720] but
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.880] with
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.980] a
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.100] lot
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.260] of
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.600] extra

[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.940] the
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.760] context
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.960] that
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.080] come
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.220] up
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.340] in
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.520] deep
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.760] learning.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.880] For
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.120] people
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.260] who
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.340] are
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.540] watching

[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.900] the
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.080] book
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.420] website,
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.220] you
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.380] should
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.840] understand
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.200] that
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.480] I'm
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.640] going
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.840] to
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.240] be
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.600] taking
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.960] live
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.460] questions
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.540] from
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.080] AI
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.300] with
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.420] the
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.660] best
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.960] audience
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.340] members
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.820] periodically,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.540] and
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.660] I'll
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.840] read
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.000] the
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.480] questions
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.500] as
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.960] I
[00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.890] answer
[00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.170] them.
[00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.790] So
[00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.890] I'm
[00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.970] going
[00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.090] to
[00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.250] start
[00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.430] out
[00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.610] by
[00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.910] looking
[00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.010] at
[00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.130] the
[00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.370] slides,
[00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.530] but
[00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.630] I'm
[00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.710] going
[00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.830] to
[00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.050] tab
[00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.290] back
[00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.450] and
[00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.650] forth
[00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.150] periodically
[00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.370] to
[00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.570] check
[00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.750] for
[00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.170] questions
[00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.390] from
[00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.510] the
[00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.790] audience.
[00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.030] So
[00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.190] go
[00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.310] ahead
[00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.430] and
[00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.590] ask
[00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.030] questions
[00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.310] as
[00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.570] they
[00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.710] come
[00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.950] up,
[00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.370] and
[00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.470] I'll
[00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.610] try
[00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.730] to
[00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.910] answer
[00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.090] them
[00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.430] quickly.
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.260] Today's
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.520] topic
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.880] is
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.240] numerical
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.960] computation
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.280] for
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.560] deep
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.840] learning.
[00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.210] Basic
[00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.650] idea
[00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.090] of
[00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.470] numerical
[00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.130] computation
[00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.110] is
[00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.290] that
[00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.430] we
[00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.570] need
[00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.650] to
[00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.790] be
[00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.010] very
[00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.330] careful
[00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.570] about
[00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.730] the
[00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.890] way
[00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.050] that
[00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.190] we
[00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.510] handle
[00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.870] real
[00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.370] numbers
[00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.970] in
[00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.070] a
[00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.230] few
[00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.490] different
[00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.090] contexts.
[00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.850] One
[00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.010] is
[00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.170] if
[00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.290] we
[00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.570] use
[00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.770] an
[00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.230] algorithm
[00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.770] that
[00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.090] has
[00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.270] to
[00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.510] do
[00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.790] some
[00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.210] kind
[00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.890] of,
[00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.530] you
[00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.810] know,
[00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.150] careful
[00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.810] representation
[00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.870] of
[00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.090] real
[00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.370] numbers
[00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.510] with
[00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.650] a
[00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.830] finite
[00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.190] number
[00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.390] of
[00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.750] bits.
[00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.850] Real
[00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.250] numbers
[00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.570] like
[00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.910] pi
[00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.250] have
[00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.570] infinitely
[00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.930] many
[00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.290] digits,
[00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.430] and
[00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.850] then
[00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.090] when
[00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.330] we
[00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.790] represent
[00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.970] them
[00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.050] in
[00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.130] a
[00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.430] computer,
[00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.650] we
[00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.910] usually
[00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.330] use
[00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.850] 32
[00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.130]-bit
[00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.530] floating
[00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.810] point
[00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.210] numbers
[00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.950] as
[00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.070] an
[00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.530] approximation
[00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.010] for
[00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.190] real
[00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.570] numbers
[00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.850] when
[00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.010] we
[00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.690] implement
[00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.870] a
[00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.030] deep
[00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.190] learning
[00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.490] algorithm
[00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.750] on
[00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.030] GPU.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.500] The
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.840] use
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.000] of
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.380] 32
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.780] bits
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.980] to
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.340] represent
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.680] something
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.840] that
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.120] really
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.560] has
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.940] infinitely
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.320] many
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.740] digits
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.540] can
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.840] often
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.360] cause
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.740] errors,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.060] and
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.220] we'd
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.340] like
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.460] to
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.600] try
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.760] to
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.100] minimize
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.880] the
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.240] amount
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.400] of
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.760] damage
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.980] to
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.100] our
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.440] program
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.660] that
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.980] happens
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.200] when
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.280] we
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.440] use
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.580] that
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.120] representation.
[00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.010] Another
[00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.690] consideration
[00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.270] for
[00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.890] numerical
[00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.410] computation
[00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.530] is
[00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.890] how
[00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.390] sensitive
[00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.670] a
[00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.910] function
[00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.310] is
[00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.950] to
[00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.330] very
[00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.730] small
[00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.090] changes
[00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.250] in
[00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.410] its
[00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.730] input.
[00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.570] This
[00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.850] comes
[00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.170] up
[00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.510] even
[00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.730] if
[00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.830] we
[00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.970] were
[00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.230] able
[00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.790] to
[00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.530] theoretically
[00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.970] use
[00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.210] real
[00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.650] numbers
[00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.290] without
[00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.610] having
[00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.790] to
[00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.150] represent
[00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.430] them
[00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.570] in
[00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.910] 32
[00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.330] bits.
[00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.930] When
[00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.030] we
[00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.150] do
[00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.390] things
[00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.610] like
[00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.070] optimize
[00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.310] a
[00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.670] function,
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.740] if
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.860] that
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.140] function
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.320] is
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.500] very
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.860] sensitive
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.180] to
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.420] little
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.660] tiny

[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.120] in
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.240] the

[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.200] it
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.480] becomes
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.640] a
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.760] lot
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.040] harder
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.300] to
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.640] search
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.940] for
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.140] the
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.420] inputs
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.700] that
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.060] minimize
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.400] that
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.820] function
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.560] because
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.080] little
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.360] tiny
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.760] changes
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.960] in
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.100] our
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.460] search
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.180] can
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.700] strongly
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.260] influence
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.560] the
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.860] outcome
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.060] of
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.200] the
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.480] search.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.640] As
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.880] a
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.160] brief
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.500] roadmap
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.840] for
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.180] today,
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.480] I'm
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.580] going
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.700] to
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.840] cover
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.060] two
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.320] different
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.800] topics.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.560] The
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.840] first
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.180] is
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.580] iterative
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.100] optimization,
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.960] how
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.080] we
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.360] actually
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.580] make
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.040] algorithms
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.380] that
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.880] search
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.180] for
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.500] the
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.960] minimal
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.380] point
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.560] of
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.760] some
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.180] function,
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.020] and
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.240] how
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.500] this
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.720] gets
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.160] affected
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.460] by
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.020] numerical
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.740] considerations.
[00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.270] Next,
[00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.430] I'm
[00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.530] going
[00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.650] to
[00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.830] talk
[00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.230] about
[00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.870] rounding
[00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.190] error,
[00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.750] underflow,
[00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.910] and
[00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.310] overflow,
[00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:37.230] how
[00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.430] the
[00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.690] use
[00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.910] of
[00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.350] 32
[00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.870] bits
[00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.430] to
[00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.710] represent
[00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.970] real
[00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.350] numbers
[00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.610] can
[00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.030] affect
[00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.430] deep
[00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.650] learning
[00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.230] programs.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.180] So
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.440] starting
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.620] out
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.800] with
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.100] iterative
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.660] optimization,
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.840] we're
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.980] going
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.100] to
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.260] cover
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.460] three
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.720] different
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.100] topics
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.320] here.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.660] The
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.900] first
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.080] is
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.240] how
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.420] the
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.680] gradient
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.000] descent
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.400] algorithm
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.740] works.
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.520] The
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.800] second
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.220] is
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.880] curvature,
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.380] the
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.640] idea
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.960] that
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.120] the
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.400] functions
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.580] we're
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.020] optimizing
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.260] are
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.480] non
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.700]-linear,
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.600] and
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.960] how
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.320] the
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.720] second
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.020] order
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.480] curvature
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.840] of
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.040] these
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.520] functions
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.300] affects
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.500] the
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.920] optimization
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.640] process.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.540] And
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.680] then
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.920] finally,
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.140] we'll
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.260] have
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.380] a
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.500] few
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.840] comments
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.040] on
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.380] constrained
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.920] optimization.
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.820] The
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.120] basic
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.520] algorithm
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.720] that
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.880] we
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.200] use
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.540] for
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.960] most
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.300] iterative
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.780] optimization
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.320] is
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.640] gradient
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.100] descent,
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.060] and
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.340] I've
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.740] illustrated
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.060] this
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.360] here
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.620] with
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.740] a
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.880] really
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.220] simple
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.700] function,
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.260] f
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.400] of
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.700] x
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.040] equals
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.320] one
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.560] half
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.840] x
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.120] squared.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.860] You
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.000] can
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.160] see
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.300] it
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.560] plotted
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.880] with
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.060] the

[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.080] that
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.200] I'm
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.480] highlighting
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.680] with
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.840] my
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.040] mouse
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.400] cursor.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.660] If
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.740] we
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.860] would
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.020] like
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.220] to
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.440] minimize
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.800] this
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.120] function,
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.340] we
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.520] can
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.680] do
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.840] it
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.040] by
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.400] following
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.620] the
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.900] gradient.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.740] Let's
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.880] say
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.040] that
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.340] x
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.520] is
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.780] greater
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.040] than
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.380] zero.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.120] The
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.420] gradient,
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.740] in
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.900] this
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.200] case,
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.580] because
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.740] the
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.940] function
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.100] is
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.260] one
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.600]-dimensional,
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.340] is
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.540] just
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.780] the
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.180] derivative.
[00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.430] So
[00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.590] the
[00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.870] derivative
[00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.310] can
[00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.430] be
[00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.790] represented
[00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.190] by
[00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.710] the
[00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.910] value
[00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.130] f
[00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.390] prime
[00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.550] of
[00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.850] x.
[00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.630] Over
[00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.970] here,
[00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.410] f
[00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.590] prime
[00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.750] of
[00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.970] x,
[00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.350] represented
[00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.510] by
[00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.670] the

[00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.130] line,
[00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.730] is
[00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.110] positive.
[00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.870] So
[00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.970] if
[00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.090] we
[00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.510] descend
[00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.690] the
[00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.990] gradient
[00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.350] by
[00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.610] moving
[00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.790] in

[00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.050] that
[00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.250] we're
[00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.510] over

[00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.470] descent

[00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.430] and
[00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.770] downhill.
[00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.410] So
[00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.690] starting
[00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.930] here,
[00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.090] we
[00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.230] would
[00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.530] trace

[00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.470] leftward
[00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.870] until
[00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.070] we
[00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.270] reach

[00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.010] point
[00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.270] here.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.480] Where

[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.220] is
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.500] zero,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.280] we
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.380] are
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.540] no

[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.040] to
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.220] move
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.300] in
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.460] any

[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.240] so
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.360] we
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.640] stop.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.960] If

[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.140] over
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.440] here
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.780] the

[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.480] is

[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.660] and
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.860] we
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.100] move
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.240] in
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.620] opposite
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.840] the

[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.080] we
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.200] would
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.600] actually

[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.500] we

[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.480] rightward
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.000] along

[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.940] x
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.220] squared
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.040] until

[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.420] reach

[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.100] and

[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.920] I've

[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.520] In

[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.260] that's
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.480] very
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.940] squiggly
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.300] and
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.740] has
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.520] several
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.160] different
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.940] local
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.380] minima.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.100] Local
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.500] minima
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.720] are
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.100] points
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.320] that
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.520] are
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.980] smaller
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.660] in
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.220] f
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.340] of
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.500] x
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.820] value
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.040] than
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.200] all
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.320] the
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.500] other
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.760] points
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.100] surrounding
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.440] them,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.260] but
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.400] they're
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.580] not
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.160] necessarily
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.200] the
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.660] lowest
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.000] point
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.400] overall.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.320] So
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.580] here,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.880] if
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.000] we
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.240] look
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.400] to
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.560] the
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.740] left
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.880] or
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.980] the
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.160] right
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.240] of
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.400] this
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.640] point,
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.860] we
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.020] go
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.240] uphill
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.420] a
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.540] little
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.800] bit.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.260] If
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.360] you
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.500] go
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.800] further
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.960] to
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.100] the
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.320] left,
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.580] we
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.860] can
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.200] find
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.680] much
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.920] lower
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.340] points.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.220] Usually
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.440] in
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.580] the
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.940] context
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.160] of
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.380] deep
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.640] learning,
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.020] we
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.320] can't
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.540] really
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.880] expect
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.160] to
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.380] find
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.620] this
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.940] global
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.260] minimum
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.580] over
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.860] here.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.440] We
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.860] might
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.160] want
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.300] to
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.440] do
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.680] that,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.880] but
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.040] it's
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.340] probably
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.600] not
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.980] feasible.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.840] In
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.180] practice,
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.560] we
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.820] often
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.040] give
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.220] up
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.340] and
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.500] find
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.620] a
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.760] point
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.940] more
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.140] like
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.360] this
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.540] one
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.780] here.
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.380] It's
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.480] a
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.680] local
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.020] minimum,
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.340] but
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.480] the
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.800] value
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.960] of
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.100] f
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.220] of
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.460] x
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.680] is
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.960] actually
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.200] very
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.520] low.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.100] So
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.220] we've
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.320] done
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.420] a
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.580] good
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.840] job
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.060] of
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.460] reducing
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.800] the
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.100] value
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.300] of
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.420] the
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.780] function,
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.500] even
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.660] if
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.780] we
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.000] don't
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.320] find
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.480] our
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.720] way
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.460] all
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.620] the
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.780] way
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.920] to
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.100] the
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.340] bottom
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.040] of
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.200] the
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.540] function.
[00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.210] In
[00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.490] practice,
[00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.790] we
[00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.930] don't
[00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.110] even
[00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.610] necessarily
[00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.030] find
[00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.170] a
[00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.410] local
[00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.710] minimum.
[00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.470] In
[00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.890] practice,
[00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.330] we
[00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.870] often
[00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.370] just
[00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.670] sort
[00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.790] of
[00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.970] get
[00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:44.430] stuck
[00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.070] for
[00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.570] numerical
[00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.090] reasons,
[00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.430] and
[00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.710] that's
[00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.930] the
[00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.170] topic
[00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.370] of
[00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.550] this
[00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.850] chapter.
[00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.090] I'm
[00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.290] fast
[00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.590]-forwarding
[00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.670] a

[00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.930] bit,
[00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:50.030] and
[00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.150] I'm
[00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.350] showing

[00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.630] chapter
[00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.930] 8.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.940] On

[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.420] In

[00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.920] different

[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.440] On

[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.600] big
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.800] the
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.240] gradients
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.540] are
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.260] over
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.660] time.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.540] Specifically,
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.800] I'm
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.100] plotting

[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.220] of
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.320] the
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.520] gradient
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.820] descent
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.280] algorithm.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.940] So
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.000] you
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.080] can
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.160] see
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.300] it's
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.440] kind
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.560] of
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.940] noisy
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.600] on
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.840] different
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.120] steps.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.280] It's
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.420] not
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.540] like
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.640] we
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.840] always
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.020] see
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.200] the
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.480] same
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.800] gradient
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.200] norm
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.240] twice
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.420] in
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.520] a
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.660] row.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.820] It
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.120] bounces
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.400] around
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.540] a
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.760] lot.
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.800] But
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.380] I've
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.640] fit
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.000] a
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.500] smooth
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.920] blue
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.420] curve
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.960] to
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.140] these
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.420] lines,
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.540] and
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.600] we
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.700] can
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.840] see
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.940] how
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.060] the
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.280] gradient
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.600] norm
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.300] actually
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.700] gradually
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.000] gets
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.320] bigger
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.580] over
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.900] time.
[00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.110] Based
[00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.310] on
[00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.550] the
[00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.830] plots
[00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.950] that
[00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.070] I
[00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.230] showed
[00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.330] you
[00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.430] on
[00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.530] the
[00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.790] previous
[00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.150] slides,
[00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.290] you
[00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.450] might
[00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.790] expect
[00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.950] that
[00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:33.090] the
[00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.310] gradient
[00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.490] norm
[00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.670] would
[00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.010] shrink
[00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.230] as
[00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.310] you
[00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.550] approach
[00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.670] a
[00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.830] local
[00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.110] minimum,
[00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.430] and
[00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.590] that
[00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.930] convergence
[00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:36.170] would
[00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.370] go
[00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.510] down
[00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.650] to
[00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.890] zero.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.940] Well,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.140] it
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.320] turns
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.440] out
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.580] that
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.680] a
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.780] lot
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.880] of
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.000] the
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.260] time,
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.160] we
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.720] actually
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.140] just
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.400] get
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.820] stuck
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.240] and
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.560] can't
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.760] really
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.020] keep
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.320] making
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.800] progress
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.080] toward
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.460] regions
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.660] of
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.120] smaller
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.160] gradient
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.480] norm.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.860] And
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.980] so
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.100] we
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.380] stop
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.660] when
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.860] f
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.980] of
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.140] x
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.280] has
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.540] become
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.780] very
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.220] small,
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.040] rather
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.540] than
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.340] when
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.000] the
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.240] gradient
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.480] has
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.640] gone
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.900] away.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.860] You
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.980] could
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.180] say
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.440] maybe
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.640] this
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.860] plot
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.980] that
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.080] I
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.220] made
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.400] here,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.520] where
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.620] I
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.740] show
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.860] the
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.040] gradient
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.340] getting
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.600] bigger
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.760] over
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.940] time,
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.540] maybe
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.760] that's
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.860] an
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.160] example
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.420] of
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.700] failure.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.940] Maybe
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.100] the
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.380] algorithm
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.560] is
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.720] just
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.060] broken.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.880] But
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.140] actually,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.300] if
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.360] we
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.480] look
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.580] at
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.680] the
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.880] plot
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:01.980] on
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.080] the
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.320] right,
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.900] I'm
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.140] showing
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.300] you
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.500] the
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.800] error
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.040] rate
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.200] of
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.300] a
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.780] classifier
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.940] that
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.020] we're
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.220] training
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.380] with
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.620] gradient
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.920] descent.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.800] And
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.000] this
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.340] error
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.660] rate
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.400] decreases
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.740] over
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.120] time
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.800] successfully
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.600] and
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.880] levels
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.120] off
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.260] to

[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.500] accuracy
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:12.840] for
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.960] the
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.180] problem
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.320] that
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.440] this
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.540] is
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.760] training
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.980] on.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.760] So
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.840] you
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:14.960] can
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.100] see
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.240] that
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.380] this
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.500] is
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:15.720] actually
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:15.840] an
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.080] example
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.200] of
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.260] the
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.600] optimization
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.280] algorithm
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.200] succeeding
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.620] from
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.780] our
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:18.960] point
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.120] of
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.280] view.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.980] It's
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.140] not
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.420] actually
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.880] finding
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.300] a

[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:21.940] minimum,
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.700] it's
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.860] just
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:23.120] finding
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.300] a

[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.060] that
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.160] we're
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.500] minimizing.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.200] And
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.360] that
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.640] low
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.940] value
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.220] turns
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.380] out
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.460] to
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.560] be
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.760] good
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.000] enough
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.220] for
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.340] us
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:29.460] to
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.620] use
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.740] the
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.960] model.
[00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.650] Someone
[00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:32.830] has
[00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.030] asked,
[00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.230] why
[00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.310] don't
[00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.450] we
[00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:33.690] test
[00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:33.830] a
[00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.070] larger
[00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.590] diversity
[00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:34.850] when
[00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.010] we've
[00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.150] reached
[00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.270] a
[00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.470] local
[00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:35.770] minimum?
[00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.410] Wouldn't
[00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:36.570] that
[00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:36.730] tell
[00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:36.850] us
[00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.910] if
[00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:36.970] we
[00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:37.070] could
[00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.190] go
[00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.450] lower
[00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.810] elsewhere?
[00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.010] And
[00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.610] the
[00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:39.830] answer
[00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.070] is
[00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.410] yes.
[00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:40.630] A
[00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:40.730] lot
[00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.810] of
[00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:40.930] the
[00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.150] time,
[00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:41.350] we
[00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.510] do
[00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.770] things
[00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.010] like
[00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.410] run
[00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.350] multiple
[00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.010] random
[00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.650] restarts
[00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:44.910] of
[00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.010] the
[00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:45.430] optimization
[00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.090] algorithm.
[00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.210] And
[00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.630] sometimes
[00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.910] you
[00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:48.190] can
[00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:48.530] find
[00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.030] lower
[00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.450] values
[00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:49.710] that
[00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.910] way.
[00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.630] For
[00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:50.770] a
[00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:50.830] lot
[00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:50.930] of
[00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:51.150] problems,
[00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.290] you
[00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.470] also
[00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:51.830] find
[00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.110] that
[00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.510] several
[00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.730] different
[00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.070] random
[00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.710] restarts
[00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.350] end
[00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.550] up
[00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.690] with
[00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:54.990] about
[00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.330] the
[00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:55.790] same
[00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.810] final
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.280] value.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.580] Someone
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:07:59.820] else
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.140] asked,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.380] can
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:00.500] you
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:00.720] please
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.080] explain
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.440] gradient
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:01.680] norm
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:01.820] a
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:01.980] bit?
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:02.760] The
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.040] basic
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.380] idea
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:03.900] is
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.140] if
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.340] you
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:04.740] have
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:04.980] an
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.260] input
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.440] to
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:05.560] your
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:05.840] function
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.320] x
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.140] with
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.080] multiple
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.040] coordinates,
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:09.940] then
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.300] the
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:10.520] gradient
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:10.840] gives
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:10.960] you
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.160] the
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.480] derivative
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.080] of
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.260] your
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.560] function
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:12.720] with
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.000] respect
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.180] to
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:13.320] each
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:13.420] of
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:13.600] those
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:13.940] coordinates.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:14.680] And
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:14.820] that
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.040] tells
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.240] us
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.440] the
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:15.740] direction
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:15.940] we
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.100] should
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.280] go
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:16.440] in
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:16.540] to
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:16.740] move
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.100] downhill.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:17.980] If
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.120] you
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.400] measure
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:18.760] the
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.040] norm
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.200] of
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.360] that
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:19.760] gradient,
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:20.520] that
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:20.740] gives
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:20.840] you
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:20.960] an
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.280] idea
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:21.700] of
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:21.960] how
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.340] steep
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:22.540] the
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:22.860] function
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.240] is.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.020] It
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.260] tells
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:24.560] you
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:24.840] how
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.180] quickly
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:25.320] you
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:25.440] can
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:25.740] expect
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:25.940] the
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.180] function
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:26.380] to
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:26.760] drop
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.560] if
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:27.960] you
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.660] move
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:28.740] in
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:28.860] a
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.200] specific
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:29.680] direction.
[00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.030] I'm
[00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:33.150] going
[00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:33.290] to
[00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.470] skip
[00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:33.630] the
[00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.790] next
[00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:34.050] question
[00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:34.270] because
[00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:34.430] it's
[00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.650] answered
[00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:34.870] later
[00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.970] in
[00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:35.070] the
[00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.290] talk.
[00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:35.450] And
[00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:35.530] then
[00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:35.650] there's
[00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:35.770] one
[00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:35.890] more
[00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.170] question
[00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.430] about
[00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:36.650] how
[00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:36.810] can
[00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:36.930] the
[00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.150] gradient
[00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:37.670] increase
[00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.910] when
[00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.010] you
[00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:38.110] are
[00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.330] using
[00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:38.450] a
[00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:38.710] descent
[00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.170] direction?
[00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.910] Is
[00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:40.030] it
[00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:40.230] not
[00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.650] convex?
[00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.130] And
[00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:42.250] it
[00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:42.410] turns
[00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:42.630] out
[00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.930] that
[00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:43.250] the
[00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.410] gradient
[00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:43.630] can
[00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.190] increase
[00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.030] if
[00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.510] you
[00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.070] optimize
[00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.430] a
[00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.570] neural
[00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:46.770] net
[00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:47.050] because
[00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:47.270] the
[00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:47.470] function
[00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.630] is
[00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.790] not
[00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.110] convex.
[00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.990] It's
[00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:49.590] also
[00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.070] possible
[00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.270] that

[00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.090] There's

[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.060] If

[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.380] have

[00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.450] So

[00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:39.870] It

[00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:26.010] then
[00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:26.170] we're
[00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:26.430] actually
[00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.550] in
[00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.630] a
[00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:26.770] very
[00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.030] nice
[00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.530] situation
[00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.890] where
[00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.030] if
[00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.130] we
[00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:28.330] take
[00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:28.490] a
[00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.750] step
[00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.010] that
[00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:29.170] was
[00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:29.530] predicted
[00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:29.830] to
[00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.270] reduce
[00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:31.130] the
[00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.530] dashed
[00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:32.790] green
[00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.290] linear
[00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:33.770] function
[00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:34.830] approximating

[00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.150] of
[00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.450] x,
[00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.150] we'll
[00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.310] find
[00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.430] that
[00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.590] f
[00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.710] of
[00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.870] x
[00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.210] actually
[00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:37.710] decreases
[00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.030] even
[00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.610] more
[00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.350] than
[00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.510] our
[00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:39.970] approximation
[00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.490] predicted

[00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:40.830] to
[00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.030] do.
[00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.190] So
[00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:42.270] if
[00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:42.330] we
[00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:42.450] can
[00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:42.670] find
[00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.990] directions
[00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.150] of
[00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.430] negative
[00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.770] curvature,
[00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.110] they're
[00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.210] a
[00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.330] good
[00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:44.470] way
[00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.610] to
[00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:44.970] reduce
[00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:45.350] the

[00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:45.730] of

[00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:46.290] very
[00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:46.650] quickly.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.300] Unfortunately
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:48.600] what
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:48.880] happens
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.000] a
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.100] lot
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:49.320] more
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:49.580] often
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:49.960] is
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.100] we
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.300] have
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:50.640] directions
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:50.860] of
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.240] positive
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.660] curvature.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.520] With
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:52.840] directions
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.040] of
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.380] positive
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:53.760] curvature,
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:54.440] the
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:54.680] function
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.060] curves
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.380] up
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:55.800] relative
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.040] to
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.180] the
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:56.360] linear
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:56.760] function.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:57.440] So
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.540] when
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:57.600] you
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:57.780] take
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.060] small
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:58.500] steps,
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:13:59.300] we
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.600] end
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:13:59.800] up
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.720] not
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.080] nearly
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.540] decreasing
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:01.740] the
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:01.960] function
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.140] as
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:02.340] much
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:02.440] as
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:02.540] we
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:02.740] wanted
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:02.980] to,
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.020] and
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.140] in
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:04.240] fact
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.360] if
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:04.440] we
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:04.580] take
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:04.900] too
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.080] big
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.260] of
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:05.400] a
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:05.640] step,
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.480] we
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:06.620] can
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.040] accidentally
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.680] increase
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:07.860] the
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.120] function
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.520] value.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.060] We
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.220] can
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:09.800] overshoot
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:09.980] the
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.180] minimum
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:10.360] in
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:10.540] this
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:10.920] direction
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.500] and
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:11.660] go
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:11.900] back
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.200] uphill.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:13.860] That's
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:13.960] why
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.060] we
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.280] start
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:14.520] looking
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:14.740] at
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:14.960] what's
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.120] called
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.320] the

[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:15.940] of
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.040] the
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.380] function.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.020] We
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:17.200] look
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:17.400] at
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:17.800] how
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.040] much

[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:18.920] is
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.020] to
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.180] this
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:19.520] function
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.120] and
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:20.400] see
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:20.640] how
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:20.760] it
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.080] affects
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.260] our
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:21.620] ability
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:21.900] to
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.180] take
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:22.620] large
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.100] steps
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:23.720] to
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.040] search
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:24.220] for

[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.020] of
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.100] the
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:25.420] function.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:28.680] Someone
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.000] asked
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.180] what
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:29.340] was
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:29.500] the

[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:30.800] just
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.040] told.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:31.660] You
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:31.780] can
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:31.960] actually
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.160] see

[00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:36.410] So
[00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.570] far
[00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:36.710] I've

[00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.230] and
[00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.310] we
[00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.470] need
[00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:43.570] to
[00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.090] understand
[00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.590] how
[00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.790] the

[00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.490] affects

[00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:49.310] We

[00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.570] do

[00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:56.910] So
[00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:57.890] if

[00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.510] you'll

[00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.050] we
[00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:04.210] take

[00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:07.410] next

[00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:07.710] take
[00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.870] the

[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:10.920] It
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.080] turns

[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:46.660] And
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:46.740] then
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:46.840] if
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:46.940] you

[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:06.760] And
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:06.880] then
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.000] when
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.100] you

[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.420] again,
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:10.720] you'll

[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.360] But
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:25.500] what
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:25.920] happens
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.180] if

[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:28.840] Well
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.000] then,
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:29.280] it
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:29.480] turns

[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:23.600] We
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:23.740] can
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:23.960] use

[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:27.600] is

[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.020] to

[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:29.400] So

[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:29.960] off,
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:30.660] if

[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:33.940] order
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.440] approximation
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:34.760] would
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:34.960] tell
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.120] us
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.240] that
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:35.340] we

[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:36.640] forever.
[00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.930] That's
[00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:38.250] probably
[00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:38.470] not
[00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.610] going

[00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:39.030] true
[00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:39.210] for

[00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.110] because
[00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.950] it's
[00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.130] very

[00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:43.610] really
[00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.990] quadratic.
[00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:44.410] It's
[00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:44.670] likely
[00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:44.830] to

[00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:47.450] size.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:48.840] The

[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.260] We
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:54.400] know
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:54.540] that
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:54.640] if
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:54.780] we

[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:56.660] downhill,
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:57.360] we
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:57.500] can
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:57.840] decrease

[00:18:59.320 --> 00:18:59.460] But
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:18:59.520] if
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:18:59.640] we
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:18:59.820] step
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.120] too
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:00.500] far,
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:00.920] we'll

[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:02.540] We
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:02.700] don't

[00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.970] We

[00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.410] the

[00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:40.210] norm
[00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:40.330] of
[00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:40.450] the

[00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.390] This
[00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.510] is
[00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.670] the

[00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.430] term,
[00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.990] plus
[00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.410] one
[00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:45.670] half
[00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.110] epsilon
[00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.590] squared
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.800] times
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.480] the
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:48.900] gradient
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.380] multiplied
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:49.680] by
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:49.820] the
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.100] Hessian
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:50.420] multiplied
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:50.720] by
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:50.860] the
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:51.140] gradient.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.040] This
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:52.260] here
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:52.460] is
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:52.900] the
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:53.540] directional

[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.280] in
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:55.400] the

[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:55.880] of
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:55.960] the
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.260] gradient
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:56.920] but
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.200] also
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.540] scaled
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:57.760] by

[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:58.800] gradient.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.600] So
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:00.700] if
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:00.780] we
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:00.960] then

[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.020] get

[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.500] and
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:07.600] we
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:07.840] solve
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:07.940] it
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.080] in
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.300] terms

[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.580] assuming
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.060] that
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.620] we're
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.000] looking
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.140] in
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:12.260] a

[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:12.760] of

[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.560] curvature,
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.560] we
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:14.760] find
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:14.900] that
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.040] the
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:15.380] optimal
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:15.720] step
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.120] size
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.940] is
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.200] equal
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.680] to
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.320] the
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:18.620] squared
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:18.820] norm
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:18.940] of
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.040] the
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:19.380] gradient
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.460] divided
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:20.720] by

[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.360] transpose
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:21.900] hg.
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:22.960] So
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.060] what
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:23.200] does
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.340] this
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:23.500] tell
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:23.660] us
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:23.980] overall?
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.100] The
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:25.400] numerator
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:25.940] says
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.300] that
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:26.500] if
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:26.740] the
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:26.960] gradient
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.220] is
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:27.520] bigger,
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:27.800] we
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:27.900] can
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.120] take
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.400] bigger
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:28.860] steps.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:29.400] So
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.620] big
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:29.980] gradients
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:30.180] will
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:30.560] speed
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:30.740] up
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:30.940] the
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.340] optimization
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:31.960] algorithm.
[00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.910] In
[00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:33.050] the
[00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:33.430] denominator,
[00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:33.850] we
[00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:34.150] actually
[00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:34.590] see
[00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.870] that
[00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:35.070] this
[00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.330] g
[00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:35.730] transpose
[00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.230] hg
[00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.610] term
[00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.370] can
[00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.730] shrink
[00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.910] the

[00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.870] a
[00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.010] lot.
[00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:39.690] So
[00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:39.790] if
[00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:39.910] the
[00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:40.190] gradient
[00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.610] happens
[00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.830] to

[00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:41.490] in
[00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:41.650] a

[00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:42.390] that's
[00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.870] aligned
[00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:43.570] with

[00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:44.430] of
[00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.550] the
[00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:44.930] Hessian
[00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:45.190] that
[00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.370] has
[00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:45.510] a
[00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.710] big
[00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:46.250] eigenvalue,
[00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:46.830] you
[00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.950] have
[00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:47.090] to

[00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.830] Otherwise
[00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:49.310] we'll
[00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.810] overshoot
[00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:50.010] the
[00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:50.210] minimum
[00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.630] and
[00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.770] go
[00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:51.010] back
[00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:51.310] uphill.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.040] Overall
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:53.360] this
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:53.700] shows
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:53.880] us
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.180] something
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:54.580] about
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.300] why
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:55.540] when
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:55.660] we
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:55.980] actually
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.180] run

[00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:57.120] in

[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.220] we
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:58.400] may
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:58.660] not
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.080] actually
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.440] arrive
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:20:59.540] at
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:20:59.640] a
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:20:59.880] critical

[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:01.720] Over
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.100] time
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:02.520] we'd
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:02.820] expect

[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.120] but
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.380] we'll
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:05.640] often

[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:40.520] And
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:40.580] we
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:40.740] have

[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:45.680] would
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:45.840] be

[00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:48.270] Basically
[00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:48.690] if

[00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:55.670] It
[00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:55.850] has
[00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:56.050] to
[00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:56.290] keep
[00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:56.490] the

[00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.530] going

[00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.890] You
[00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:01.010] can
[00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.190] see
[00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.370] this

[00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:03.310] Here
[00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.450] we're

[00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:05.550] Each

[00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.810] rings
[00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:07.250] shows

[00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.530] of

[00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.710] where

[00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:10.810] equal
[00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:11.190] value.
[00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:11.910] So
[00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:12.130] at
[00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:12.410] the

[00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.830] here
[00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.990] we've
[00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.070] got

[00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.230] Every
[00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.410] time
[00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:14.530] we
[00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:14.690] see

[00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.110] on

[00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:15.530] out,
[00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.730] we're
[00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:15.950] taking
[00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:16.170] a

[00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.270] function.
[00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:19.650] And
[00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:20.630] the
[00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.150] red
[00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:21.550] path
[00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:21.730] is

[00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.210] moves.
[00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.230] Ideally
[00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.570] gradient
[00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:24.890] descent
[00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:25.450] would
[00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:25.970] want
[00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:26.130] to
[00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:26.650] just
[00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:27.010] point

[00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.450] straight
[00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:28.750] there.
[00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.710] Instead
[00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:30.090] we
[00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:30.290] keep
[00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:30.550] finding
[00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:30.790] that
[00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:30.970] the
[00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:31.490] gradients
[00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:32.030] tend
[00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:32.170] to

[00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.890] canyon.
[00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.630] And
[00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.830] so
[00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:36.370] we
[00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:37.250] keep
[00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.470] going
[00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.730] down
[00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.890] the

[00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:39.150] overshooting
[00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:39.350] the
[00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.530] bottom
[00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:39.670] of
[00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:39.810] the
[00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:40.030] canyon,
[00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.370] and
[00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.530] coming
[00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:40.630] to
[00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.770] the

[00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:41.210] of
[00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:41.330] the
[00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.570] canyon.
[00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:42.250] So
[00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:42.310] you
[00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.370] go
[00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:42.450] in
[00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:42.570] this
[00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.150] zigzagging
[00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:43.530] fashion
[00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.490] where
[00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:44.710] we're
[00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:45.010] always
[00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:45.390] walking
[00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:45.590] up
[00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.670] or
[00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:45.810] down
[00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:45.950] a
[00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:46.130] canyon
[00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.410] wall
[00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:46.690] instead
[00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:46.950] of
[00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.130] kind
[00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:47.290] of
[00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:47.790] flowing
[00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.290] down
[00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:48.590] along
[00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.810] the

[00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.250] the
[00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.470] canyon.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.060] You
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:51.180] can
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.300] see
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:51.460] this
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:51.620] with
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:51.820] neural

[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:52.880] That
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.100] same

[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.260] earlier
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:54.800] includes
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.340] this

[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.480] happens
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.360] in
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:02.760] a

[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.240] of
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:06.660] parameters.
[00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.890] We
[00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:08.010] can
[00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:08.150] see
[00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:08.310] that

[00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.750] down
[00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.930] this
[00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.250] really
[00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.570] tight
[00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:13.990] canyon
[00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.690] with

[00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:18.070] And
[00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.350] so
[00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.950] the
[00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:19.210] gradient
[00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:19.410] is
[00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:19.650] actually
[00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:19.910] still
[00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:20.170] pretty
[00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:20.510] large
[00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.850] here,
[00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.090] but
[00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:22.650] the
[00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:22.990] curvature
[00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.830] is
[00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:24.070] even
[00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.450] larger.
[00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:25.110] And
[00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.290] the
[00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:25.530] curvature
[00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:25.890] makes
[00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:26.010] it
[00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:26.190] really
[00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.430] hard
[00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.570] to
[00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.770] take
[00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:27.070] large

[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.160] Some
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:29.340] things
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:29.520] about
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:29.660] this
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.140] visualization
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:30.420] are
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:30.540] a
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:30.660] little
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:30.860] bit
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.060] hard
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:31.240] to
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.640] understand
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.100] because
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:32.780] when
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.000] you
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.260] work
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:33.540] with
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:33.980] multiple
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.020] dimensions
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.280] and
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:35.560] project
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:35.760] them
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:35.940] down
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.080] to
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.220] just
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:36.380] a
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:36.500] few
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:36.940] dimensions,
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:37.980] some
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.220] things
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.460] can
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:38.780] be
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.240] lost.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.120] So
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:40.220] one
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:40.320] thing
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:40.400] that
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:40.500] we
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:40.780] can't
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:40.960] see
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.260] here
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:41.480] is
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:41.820] that
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.400] this
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:42.800] blue
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.260] curve
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:43.520] is
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:43.840] actually
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.480] zigzagging
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:44.640] a
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:44.980] lot,
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:45.420] just
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:45.600] like
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:45.720] in
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:45.840] the
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.180] previous
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:46.980] visualization.
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:47.840] It's
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.060] just
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.420] that
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.460] the
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:49.720] way
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:49.920] that
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.240] we
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.180] made
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:51.460] this
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:51.900] plot
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.700] means
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:52.840] that
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:52.960] we
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.260] can't
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:53.540] actually
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:53.840] see
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.020] the

[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.600] dimensions
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:54.780] where
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:54.920] it's
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.440] zigzagging.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:56.600] But
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:56.860] those
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:57.380] zigzags
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:57.680] are
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.140] stopping
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:58.360] it
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:58.660] from
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.100] moving
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:23:59.240] a

[00:23:59.380 --> 00:23:59.760] faster
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.060] along

[00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.610] The
[00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:02.830] last

[00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:03.410] that
[00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:03.590] we'll
[00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.790] cover
[00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:04.010] for
[00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.310] iterative
[00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.770] optimization
[00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:05.390] is
[00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.510] the

[00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.210] of

[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.400] And
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:08.500] I
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:08.620] don't
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:08.820] actually
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:08.940] have
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:09.040] a

[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.100] I'm

[00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:49.510] and
[00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.670] so
[00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:49.850] on,
[00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:50.530] you
[00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:50.690] can
[00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:50.950] just
[00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:51.610] project
[00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:52.010] x

[00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.510] that

[00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:54.970] after

[00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:55.450] step.
[00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:56.270] And
[00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:56.510] that's
[00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.630] a
[00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.850] very
[00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:57.350] practical,
[00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:57.710] easy

[00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.590] Someone
[00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.910] has
[00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:04.270] asked
[00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:04.650] which
[00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:04.950] data
[00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:05.470] visualization
[00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.690] did
[00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.750] you
[00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.930] use
[00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:06.030] to
[00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:06.230] plot
[00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.390] the
[00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.570] data
[00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.030] points?
[00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:08.050] And
[00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:08.790] for
[00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:08.990] that
[00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.130] you
[00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:09.310] should
[00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.550] read
[00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:09.690] the
[00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:09.970] paper.
[00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:10.370] It's
[00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.550] a
[00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.010] visualization
[00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:11.250] that
[00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:11.330] we
[00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.490] came
[00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:11.630] up
[00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:12.150] specifically
[00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:12.530] for
[00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:12.710] that
[00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.990] paper.
[00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:13.310] It's
[00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.710] not
[00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.890] a
[00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:14.110] standard
[00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.550] technique.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:17.520] Someone
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:17.800] else
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.180] asked
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:18.580] what
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:18.920] happens
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.040] if
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:19.140] we
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:19.240] do
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:19.420] not
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:19.680] choose
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:19.840] the
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.160] direction
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.280] or
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:20.380] the
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:20.560] gradient
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.020] points
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.660] but
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.080] select
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:22.240] the
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:22.600] direction
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:22.800] where
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:22.920] the
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.120] step
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:23.240] we
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.340] can
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:23.620] take
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:23.940] is
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.420] maximal?
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.220] So
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:25.380] yeah,
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:25.560] you
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:25.740] can
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.040] actually
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:26.360] look
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:26.640] for
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.260] directions
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.160] where
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.420] you
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:28.860] intentionally
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.260] seek
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:29.420] out
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:29.760] negative
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.140] curvature
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:30.400] and
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:30.580] so
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:30.820] on.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.660] It
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:31.900] turns
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.040] out
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.160] to
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:32.320] be
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:32.720] difficult
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.000] to
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.180] do
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:33.380] that
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:33.560] in
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:33.720] high
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.020] dimensional
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:34.620] space.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:35.740] Someone
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.060] asks
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:36.420] what
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:36.760] gradient
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.000] descent
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.540] optimizers
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:37.720] would
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:37.820] you
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.180] recommend?
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.240] I
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:39.420] would
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:39.560] say
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.020] usually
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:40.580] atom
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.020] or
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.380] gradient
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:41.720] descent
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:41.940] with
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.320] momentum
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:42.660] are
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:42.860] pretty
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.160] good,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:43.800] and
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:43.900] a
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.000] lot
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.080] of
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:44.160] the
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:44.340] time
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:44.440] you
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:44.560] should
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:44.920] consider
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.220] using
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:45.520] gradient
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:45.880] clipping.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:46.780] The
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.000] next
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.240] part
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:47.380] of
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:47.560] our
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:47.860] overall
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.180] roadmap
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:48.780] is
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.060] to
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.580] discuss
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:49.900] what
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:50.220] happens
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:50.340] when
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:50.440] we
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:50.660] have
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.000] rounding
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:51.300] error,
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:51.860] when
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:51.960] we
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.140] have
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:52.840] underflow,
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:53.500] overflow,
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.280] all
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:54.400] of
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:54.540] these
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:54.840] issues
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.040] that
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.300] happen
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:55.460] when
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:55.540] we
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:55.740] use
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:55.980] a
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.220] finite
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:56.520] number
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:56.740] of
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.040] bits
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.340] to
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:57.660] represent
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:57.960] real
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.400] numbers.
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.380] This
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:00.540] is
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:00.780] really
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.180] important.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:01.440] I
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:01.580] know
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:01.740] it
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:01.960] sounds
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.160] kind
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.280] of
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:02.560] boring
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:02.820] to
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.040] talk
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:03.420] about
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:03.880] this

[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:04.260]-level
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:04.600] stuff
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:04.800] with
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.160] bits,
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:05.800] but
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.200] writing
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.600] numerically
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.000] precise
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.340] code
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:07.500] is
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:07.920] actually
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.360] a

[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.400] A
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:10.540] lot
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:10.620] of
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:10.740] the
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.040] time
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:11.340] you'll
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:11.540] find
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:11.680] that
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:11.860] deep

[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:13.600] when
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:13.700] you
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:13.860] code
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:14.020] them
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:14.220] up.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:14.840] The

[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.260] will
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:15.460] go
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:15.800] down,

[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:21.100] And
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:21.340] you
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:21.460] can

[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.060] you

[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:26.880] but
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.260] maybe
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:27.460] there
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:27.560] are
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:27.720] some

[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:30.720] And
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.040] that's
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:31.360] often

[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:38.300] should.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:39.680] And
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.420] another
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:40.760] time
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.120] you'll

[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.000] You
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.120] get

[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:45.500] you
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:45.620] get
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:45.720] a
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:45.800] lot
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:45.920] of
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.140] very
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:46.500] large

[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:47.580] and
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:47.740] this
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:47.940] might
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:48.260] happen
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:48.500] even
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:48.660] if
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:48.760] you
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:48.940] make
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:49.100] your

[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:50.460] and
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:50.540] you
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:50.720] think
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:50.980] everything
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:51.200] should
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.360] be
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:51.660] stable.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:52.880] Both
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.000] of
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.120] these
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:53.460] problems
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.000] actually
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.700] usually
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.180] come
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:55.520] from
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:55.840] writing
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.220] code
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:56.500] that
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:56.980] doesn't
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.260] have
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:57.480] high
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:57.700] enough
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.120] numerical
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:58.600] precision.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:27:59.660] So
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.160] being
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:00.300] able
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:00.420] to

[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:01.400] precise
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:01.760] code
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.060] can
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.760] really
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.240] differentiate
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:03.640] how
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:03.820] well
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:03.940] you
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.380] perform
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.160] as
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:05.280] a

[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.180] practitioner.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.200] A
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:07.320] lot
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:07.400] of
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:07.560] people
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:07.700] have
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:07.780] heard
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:07.940] the
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:08.140] story
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:08.260] of
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:08.360] how
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:08.500] when
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:08.620] I
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:08.800] first
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:08.960] thought
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.060] of
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:09.340] generative
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:09.840] adversarial
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.140] nets,
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:10.400] I
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:10.580] was
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:10.720] at
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:10.840] a
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.080] bar
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.580] and
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:11.760] I
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:11.920] went
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.140] home
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:12.240] and
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:12.360] I
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:12.580] coded
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:12.740] them
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:12.900] up
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.320] immediately.
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:14.320] And
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:14.520] you
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:14.600] know
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:14.800] within
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.160] an
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:15.520] hour
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:15.760] or
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:15.880] so
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.120] later
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:16.360] I
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:16.640] actually
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:16.860] had
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:16.980] them
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.220] working.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:18.600] A
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:18.680] lot
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:18.760] of
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:18.880] people
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.000] have
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:19.140] wondered
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:19.380] how
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:19.500] I
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:19.620] was
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:19.780] able
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:19.920] to
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.060] do
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:20.300] that,
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:20.600] and
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:20.820] part
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:20.900] of
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.000] the
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.280] answer
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.020] is
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:22.360] that
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:22.660] I
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:22.900] knew
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.240] about
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:23.460] all
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:23.580] of
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:23.760] this
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.080] really
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.480] boring
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.260] numerical
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:25.680] precision
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.120] stuff,
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:26.840] so
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.160] I
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:27.420] didn't
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:27.680] waste
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:27.900] any
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.200] time
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.560] shooting
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:28.920] myself
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.080] in
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:29.200] the
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:29.420] foot
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.320] writing
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:30.960] numerically
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.500] imprecise

[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:32.760] And
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.120] that
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.520] reduces
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:33.700] the
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:33.820] amount
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:33.920] of
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.080] time
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:34.220] it
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:34.440] takes
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:34.560] to
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:34.660] get
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:34.760] the

[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.320] working
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:35.480] a
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:35.840] lot.
[00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:37.770] The
[00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:38.070] basic
[00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.490] idea
[00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:38.930] is
[00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:39.190] that
[00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.490] when
[00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:39.670] you
[00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:40.090] use
[00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:40.490] a
[00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.690] finite
[00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:40.950] number
[00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:41.130] of
[00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:41.410] bits
[00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:41.690] to
[00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:42.070] represent
[00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.510] a
[00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:42.690] real
[00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:43.010] number,
[00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:43.590] you
[00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.790] get
[00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:44.170] both
[00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:44.550] rounding
[00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:44.870] errors
[00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:45.170] and
[00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:45.330] what
[00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:45.450] are
[00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:45.730] called
[00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:46.330] truncation
[00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:46.770] errors.
[00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:47.630] In
[00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.750] a
[00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.970] digital
[00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:48.350] computer
[00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.610] we're
[00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:48.890] usually
[00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:49.230] talking
[00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.530] about
[00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:49.910] using
[00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:50.310] float
[00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.790] 32
[00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.830] or
[00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.090] some
[00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:52.350] other
[00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.810] similar
[00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:53.330] schemes
[00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.610] to
[00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:53.910] represent
[00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:54.150] real
[00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:54.530] numbers.
[00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:55.210] That's
[00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:55.610] especially
[00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.950] true
[00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:56.150] when
[00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:56.290] we're
[00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:56.630] using
[00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:57.070] CUDA
[00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.510] on
[00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.250] GPUs.
[00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:59.290] Sometimes
[00:28:59.290 --> 00:28:59.530] we
[00:28:59.530 --> 00:28:59.710] use
[00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.930] other
[00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:00.270] floating
[00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:00.970] formats.
[00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:01.630] A
[00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.730] lot
[00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:01.810] of
[00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:01.930] the
[00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:02.170] problems
[00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:02.310] I'm
[00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.410] going
[00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:02.490] to
[00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:02.770] describe
[00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:03.090] here
[00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:03.390] will
[00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:03.810] often
[00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:04.310] mostly
[00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.530] go
[00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:04.850] away
[00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:05.490] if
[00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:05.630] you're
[00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.790] able
[00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:05.950] to
[00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:06.170] switch
[00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:06.350] to
[00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.610] float
[00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:07.110] 64,
[00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.870] but
[00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:08.030] that
[00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:08.350] usually
[00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.270] requires
[00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.070] you
[00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.230] know
[00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.710] slower
[00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:11.350] computation
[00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.670] on
[00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:12.050] GPU
[00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:12.930] or
[00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:13.170] may
[00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:13.330] even
[00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:13.610] force
[00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.710] you
[00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.810] to
[00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:13.930] move
[00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:14.090] to
[00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.430] CPU.
[00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:15.130] It
[00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:15.250] will
[00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:15.430] also
[00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.690] force
[00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:15.810] you
[00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:15.890] to
[00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:16.030] use
[00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:16.210] more
[00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:16.510] memory.
[00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:17.270] So
[00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:17.370] if
[00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:17.470] you
[00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.710] can
[00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:17.930] write
[00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:18.370] numerically
[00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:18.810] precise
[00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:19.190] code
[00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.610] using
[00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:19.930] float
[00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:20.350] 32,
[00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:21.330] then
[00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:21.590] that
[00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.710] can
[00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.810] be
[00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:21.930] a
[00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:22.070] big
[00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.530] advantage.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:24.640] There's
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.000] basically
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.340] three
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:25.700] categories
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:25.980] of
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.360] problems
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:26.740] that
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.220] happen
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.120] on
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:28.900] these
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.380] kinds
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:29.940] of
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.700] 32
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:30.920]-bit
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.460] representations.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:32.420] So
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:32.740] first,
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.340] most
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:33.600] numbers
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:33.740] that
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:33.860] you
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.060] work
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:34.380] with,
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:34.860] they're
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.000] not
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.120] going
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.260] to
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:35.480] cause
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:35.960] catastrophic
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.420] problems
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:36.600] on
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:36.720] their
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:36.960] own,
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.520] but
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:37.620] they
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:37.780] are
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:37.920] going
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.040] to
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.200] get
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.500] rounded.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:38.920] If
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.000] you
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.100] have
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:39.240] some
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.420] real
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:39.660] number
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.040] x
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:40.360] and
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:40.480] you
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:40.680] turn
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:40.820] it
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.200] into
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:41.720] a
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.160] representation
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.480] on
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:42.860] computer,
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:43.580] it's
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:43.700] going
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:43.780] to
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:43.920] get
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.180] rounded
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:44.520] to
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:44.760] some
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.020] value
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:45.320] x
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:45.620] plus
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:45.980] delta,
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.320] where
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:46.620] delta
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:46.860] is
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.060] just
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.420] some
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.180] small

[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.180] describing
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:49.520] the

[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.060] error
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:50.260] that
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:50.580] happened
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:50.960] that
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.120] you'll
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.300] be
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:51.620] off
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:51.820] by
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:51.960] a

[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:52.580] from
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:52.720] what
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:52.820] you
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:52.960] meant
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.080] to
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:53.240] be.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.120] A
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.380] larger
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:55.840] problem
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.240] is
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.480] when
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:56.760] you
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.020] have
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:57.220] some

[00:29:59.520 --> 00:29:59.700] you
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:29:59.920] just
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.320] can't
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:00.640] represent
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:00.840] it
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.040] with
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:01.240] the
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:01.560] range
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:01.720] of
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.060] numbers
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:02.800] that
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.040] your
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:03.300] float
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:03.680] 32
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.180] values
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:04.380] can
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:04.720] represent,
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:05.940] and
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:06.120] it
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:06.260] will
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:06.460] actually
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:06.620] get
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.040] replaced
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:07.520] by
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:07.860] some
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.440] placeholder
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:08.920] like
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.460] inf,
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:10.320] just
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:10.560] saying
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:10.820] that
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:11.100] x
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.240] is
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:11.420] too
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:11.660] large
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:11.800] to
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.180] represent.
[00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:13.510] And
[00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.630] so
[00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.830] now
[00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:14.010] it's
[00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:14.270] not
[00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:14.610] really
[00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:14.770] a
[00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:14.970] finite
[00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:15.290] value
[00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:15.630] anymore.
[00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:15.930] You've
[00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:16.070] got
[00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.410] this
[00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.210] infinite
[00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.590] number,
[00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:18.130] and
[00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:18.870] your
[00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:19.130] code
[00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.270] will
[00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:19.550] probably
[00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:19.850] still
[00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:20.030] go
[00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:20.190] ahead
[00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.330] and
[00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.510] keep
[00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:20.710] doing
[00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:21.110] arithmetic
[00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:22.050] on
[00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:22.230] this
[00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.490] number
[00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.790] as
[00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:22.950] if
[00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:23.090] it
[00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.290] were
[00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:23.690] a
[00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.830] real
[00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:24.130] value,
[00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:24.290] and
[00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:24.410] then
[00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:24.510] you'll
[00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:24.630] get
[00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.770] in
[00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:24.970] trouble.
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:27.200] There's
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:27.400] another
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:27.760] topic
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.040] which
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.360] is
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.140] still
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:29.580] basically
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:29.780] a
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:29.920] kind
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.020] of
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:30.260] rounding
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:30.440] error,
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:30.600] but
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:30.720] it's
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:30.800] a
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.200] particularly
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.640] harmful
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:31.940] kind
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:32.300] of
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.500] rounding
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:32.800] error,
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:33.360] where
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:33.420] if
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:33.460] you
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:33.560] have
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:33.640] a
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:33.800] very
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.220] small
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:34.520] value
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:34.720] of
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.020] x,
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:35.600] it
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:35.740] can
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:35.900] get
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.260] replaced
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:36.540] by
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:36.960] zero.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.160] This
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.300] is
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:38.640] especially
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:38.940] harmful
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.240] because
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:39.420] a
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:39.480] lot
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:39.580] of
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:39.680] the
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.060] algorithms
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:40.680] in
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.120] deep
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.380] learning
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:41.740] often
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.060] assume
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:42.200] that
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:42.320] we
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:42.520] have
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:42.780] some
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.440] very
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:43.880] small
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.080] but
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:44.460] non
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:44.880]-zero
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.060] variable.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:46.480] Like
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:46.620] for
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.020] example,
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:47.420] if
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:47.580] you
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:47.900] use
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.100] the
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.520] logistic
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.020] sigmoid
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:49.560] activation
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.140] function,
[00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.490] you
[00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:51.630] can
[00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.870] pass
[00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:52.130] very
[00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:52.450] negative
[00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:52.890] values
[00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:53.070] to
[00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.190] the
[00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.510] logistic
[00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:54.070] sigmoid,
[00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:55.150] and
[00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.050] algebraically
[00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:56.410] they'll
[00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:56.610] never
[00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:56.990] become
[00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.490] quite
[00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:57.790] zero,
[00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:58.450] but
[00:30:58.450 --> 00:30:58.550] in
[00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:58.670] a
[00:30:58.670 --> 00:30:58.990] computer
[00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.230] they
[00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.370] can
[00:30:59.370 --> 00:30:59.690] definitely
[00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.910] get
[00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:00.150] rounded
[00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:00.390] down
[00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:00.530] to
[00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:00.810] zero.
[00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:03.090] And
[00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:03.290] so
[00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:03.490] people
[00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:03.630] are
[00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:03.850] asking,
[00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:04.090] aren't
[00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:04.250] these
[00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:04.590] numerical
[00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.950] issues
[00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:05.350] already
[00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.750] addressed
[00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.990] in
[00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.130] the
[00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:06.350] current
[00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.590] deep
[00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.810] learning
[00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:07.250] libraries?
[00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:08.430] And
[00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:09.170] the
[00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:09.350] answer
[00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.510] is
[00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:09.850] basically
[00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:10.570] yes,
[00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:10.850] but
[00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.970] you
[00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:11.150] need
[00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:11.290] to
[00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:11.530] know
[00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:11.730] when
[00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:11.850] to
[00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.010] look
[00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:12.190] out
[00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:12.350] for
[00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.570] them.
[00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:13.090] A
[00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:13.210] lot
[00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:13.310] of
[00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.430] the
[00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.610] time
[00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.750] you
[00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.910] write
[00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:14.070] your
[00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.310] own
[00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.750] code,
[00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:15.590] and
[00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.950] you
[00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:16.370] might
[00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.650] end
[00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:16.850] up
[00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:17.390] rewriting
[00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:17.650] a
[00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:17.910] version
[00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:18.090] of
[00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:18.310] something
[00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.550] that
[00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:19.170] already
[00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:19.410] has
[00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:19.510] a
[00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:19.850] numerically
[00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:20.190] stable
[00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.670] variant.
[00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.150] Sometimes
[00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:22.650] you
[00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:22.870] might
[00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.130] need
[00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:23.550] to,
[00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.850] for
[00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:24.070] example,
[00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:24.450] compute
[00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:24.590] a
[00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.050] softmax
[00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:25.350] over
[00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.710] several
[00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:26.190] tensors
[00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.970] instead
[00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:27.090] of
[00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:27.270] just
[00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:27.510] one
[00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:27.870] tensor,
[00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:28.550] and
[00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:28.690] you'll
[00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:28.770] need
[00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:28.870] to
[00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:29.010] know
[00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:29.190] how
[00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.450] to
[00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.630] do
[00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.810] that
[00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:29.930] in
[00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:30.010] a
[00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.370] numerically
[00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:30.710] stable
[00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:31.010] way
[00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:31.630] if
[00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:31.810] your
[00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:32.070] library
[00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.350] only
[00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.690] provides
[00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:32.830] a
[00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:33.250] softmax
[00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:33.450] for
[00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:33.590] a
[00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.790] single
[00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.150] tensor.
[00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:37.390] Some
[00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:37.610] other
[00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:38.050] people
[00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.390] are
[00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:39.790] asking
[00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.210] if
[00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:40.410] there's
[00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:40.590] any
[00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.850] pointers
[00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:41.030] on
[00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:41.150] the
[00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:41.310] best
[00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.470] way
[00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.550] to
[00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:41.710] deal
[00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.850] with
[00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:42.210] NANDs.
[00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:42.390] That's
[00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:42.650] basically
[00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:42.790] what
[00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:42.890] the
[00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:43.050] next
[00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:43.270] several
[00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:43.570] slides
[00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:43.690] will
[00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:43.910] do.
[00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:45.190] Someone
[00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.430] asks,
[00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:45.610] how
[00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:45.750] does
[00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.870] the
[00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:46.250] 64
[00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:46.430]-bit
[00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.770] representation
[00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:47.290] solve
[00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:47.510] the
[00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.690] NAND
[00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:48.010] error?
[00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:48.930] Well,
[00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.190] the
[00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.390] basic
[00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:49.630] idea
[00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:49.810] is
[00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:49.890] that
[00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:49.990] if
[00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.070] you
[00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.210] have
[00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.570] 32
[00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:50.910] bits,
[00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:51.170] there's
[00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:51.270] a
[00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:51.430] certain
[00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.750] range
[00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.870] of
[00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:52.150] values
[00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:52.310] that
[00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.390] you
[00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:52.490] can
[00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:52.830] represent.
[00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:55.310] If
[00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.710] you
[00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:56.510] have
[00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.030] 64
[00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:57.410] bits,
[00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:57.790] that
[00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.110] range
[00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.630] expands.
[00:31:59.490 --> 00:31:59.950] So
[00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:00.270] a
[00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:00.570] program
[00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:01.030] that
[00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:01.430] might
[00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:02.230] cause
[00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.410] a
[00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:02.650] NAND
[00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:02.850] when
[00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:02.970] you
[00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:03.150] use
[00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.510] 32
[00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:03.970] bits
[00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.730] might
[00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:05.150] actually
[00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:05.490] avoid
[00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:05.630] the
[00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.770] NAND
[00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:05.930] when
[00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:06.010] you
[00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.230] use
[00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.690] 64
[00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.050] bits.
[00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:08.050] If
[00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:08.370] you
[00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:08.610] use
[00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:08.710] a
[00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.930] program
[00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:09.090] that
[00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:09.290] uses
[00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:09.610] even
[00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:09.890] bigger
[00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:10.230] numbers,
[00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.370] you
[00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:10.490] can
[00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.790] eventually
[00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:11.210] still
[00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.430] get
[00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.870] NANDs
[00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.970] for
[00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:12.430] 64
[00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.810] bits.
[00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:13.050] It's
[00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:13.270] just
[00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:13.690] that
[00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:14.690] fewer
[00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:15.250] programs
[00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:15.610] cause
[00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.150] problems
[00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:16.570] using
[00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:17.130] 64
[00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:17.490] bits
[00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:17.670] than
[00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:17.890] using
[00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:18.310] 32.
[00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.750] One
[00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:20.090] example
[00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.350] is
[00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.570] if
[00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.690] you
[00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.870] look
[00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:21.050] at
[00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:21.450] the
[00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:21.950] PyLearn2
[00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:22.570] repository
[00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:23.570] that
[00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.790] I
[00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:23.950] used
[00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:24.130] to
[00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:24.310] work
[00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.570] on
[00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:24.870] in
[00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:25.290] grad
[00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:25.550] school
[00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:25.850] before
[00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:26.030] we
[00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:26.150] had
[00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:26.510] TensorFlow,
[00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.410] you
[00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:27.510] can
[00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:27.630] look
[00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:27.730] at
[00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:27.850] some
[00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:27.950] of
[00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:28.050] the
[00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:28.270] unit
[00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:28.730] tests,
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:29.740] and
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:29.820] when
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:29.920] I
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.180] compute
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:30.360] the
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:30.560] KL
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:30.960] divergence
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.400] between
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:31.700] two
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.000] Gaussian
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.580] distributions,
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:33.760] if
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:33.860] I
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.040] use
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.780] float64,
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:35.600] the
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:35.840] unit
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.280] test
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.060] expects
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:37.460] the
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:37.720] KL
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.060] divergence
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:38.320] to
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:38.440] have
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:38.580] a
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:38.760] minimum
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.160] value
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:39.360] of
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:39.640] 0.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.320] But
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:41.940] if
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.300] I
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:42.900] use
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.640] float32,
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.340] the
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:44.540] unit
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:44.880] test
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.340] actually
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:45.660] has
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:45.840] to
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:46.160] allow
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:46.520] the
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:46.820] KL
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.120] divergence
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:47.420] to
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:47.620] go
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:47.960] slightly
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.320] negative.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:49.680] So
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:49.820] one
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.140] example
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:50.400] of
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:50.580] how
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:50.760] we
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:50.920] can
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.260] get
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:51.720] rounding
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.100] errors
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:52.280] and
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:52.400] they
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:52.500] can
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:52.800] affect
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.100] this
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:53.420] code
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.340] is
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:54.640] what
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:54.940] happens
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:55.040] when
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.120] you
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:55.280] add
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:55.380] a
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:55.540] very
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:55.820] small
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:56.080] number
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:56.380] to
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:56.520] a
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:56.700] larger
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.020] number.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:57.740] So
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:57.840] we're
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:57.940] going
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.040] to
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:58.200] make
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.320] an
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:58.600] array
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.160] using
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:32:59.620] 32
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:32:59.860]-bit
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:00.240] floats,
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.020] and
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.140] we're
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:01.240] going
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:01.380] to
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:01.640] store
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:01.880] the
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.120] value
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:02.420] 0
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:02.860] and
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.040] the
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:03.380] value
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:03.680] 10
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:03.780] to
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:03.880] the
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.080] minus
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:04.340] 8
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:04.680] in
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:04.840] this
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.080] array.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.040] If
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:06.160] we
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:06.420] compute
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:06.640] the
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.100] argmax
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:07.400] of
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:07.620] this
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:07.920] array,
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:08.640] the
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.020] argmax
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:09.220] is
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:09.560] 1
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.400] because
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:10.880] position
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.240] 0
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:11.740] has
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:11.840] a
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.000] value
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.120] of
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.320] 0,
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:12.760] position
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.120] 1
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:13.740] has
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:13.940] a
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:14.700] positive
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.040] but
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:15.220] very
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:15.520] small
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:15.860] value
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.080] of
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:16.200] 10
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.280] to
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:16.380] the
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:16.540] minus
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:16.820] 8.
[00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:18.070] So
[00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.270] now
[00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:18.590] suppose
[00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.770] that
[00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:18.870] we
[00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:19.070] take
[00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.270] these
[00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:19.510] numbers
[00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:19.810] and
[00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:19.950] we
[00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:20.170] add
[00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:20.290] them
[00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:20.430] to
[00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.530] a
[00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:20.690] much
[00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.990] larger
[00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.290] number.
[00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.990] We
[00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.170] add
[00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:22.310] them
[00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.510] to
[00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:22.890] 1.
[00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:24.090] Well,
[00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.550] 0
[00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:24.830] is
[00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.970] going
[00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:25.130] to
[00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.490] have
[00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.710] 1
[00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:25.890] added
[00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:26.090] to
[00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.210] it
[00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.350] and
[00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:26.470] end
[00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.570] up
[00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.670] with
[00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:26.770] a
[00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:26.930] value
[00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:27.090] of
[00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:27.310] 1.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:28.980] Ideally,
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:29.560] 1
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:29.960] plus
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.200] 10
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:30.300] to
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:30.380] the
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:30.580] minus
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:30.980] 8
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.640] would
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:31.880] be
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.440] represented
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.000] as
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.420] 1,
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.920] sorry,
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.500] 1
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.200].0000001
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:38.440] after
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:38.860] the
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:39.080] correct
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.240] number
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:39.360] of
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:39.560] zeros.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.240] In
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:40.360] this
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:40.520] case,
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:40.700] it's
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:40.980] actually
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:41.100] going
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.160] to
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:41.300] get
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:41.660] rounded
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:41.920] to
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.260] 1,
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:42.840] which
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.040] isn't
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.240] quite
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:43.360] what
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:43.440] we
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:43.720] want.
[00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:44.850] When
[00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:44.950] you
[00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:45.110] take
[00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.230] the
[00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.610] argmax
[00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:45.810] of
[00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:45.930] the
[00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:46.070] new
[00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.390] array
[00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:46.630] where
[00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.730] we
[00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.890] added
[00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:47.090] 1
[00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.270] to
[00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:47.470] it,
[00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.970] we
[00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:48.150] actually
[00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:48.290] get
[00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:48.390] that
[00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:48.530] the
[00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:48.890] argmax
[00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:49.090] is
[00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:49.330] 0
[00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:49.650] now
[00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:50.130] because
[00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:50.570] numpy
[00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.070] breaks
[00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.410] ties
[00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:51.830] to
[00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.770] the
[00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:53.090] first
[00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.450] index
[00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:53.710] that's
[00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:53.870] tied
[00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:54.030] for
[00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:54.150] the
[00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:54.450] max.
[00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:55.910] So
[00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:56.250] this
[00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.250] addition
[00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:57.690] of
[00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:57.870] a
[00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:58.110] number
[00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.430] that
[00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.710] caused
[00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:59.050] rounding
[00:33:59.050 --> 00:33:59.290] error
[00:33:59.290 --> 00:33:59.890] has
[00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:00.250] actually
[00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:00.870] downstream
[00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:01.390] changed
[00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:01.530] the
[00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:01.850] results
[00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:02.110] quite
[00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.210] a
[00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.410] lot.
[00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.090] We
[00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:03.270] only
[00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:03.510] really
[00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:03.670] wanted
[00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:03.830] to
[00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:04.170] extract
[00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:04.370] a
[00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.610] single
[00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.930] bit
[00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:05.330] from
[00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.590] this
[00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.150] computation,
[00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:06.850] and
[00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:06.950] we're
[00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:07.130] now
[00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.410] actually
[00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:07.650] getting
[00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:07.810] the
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.070] value
[00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:08.230] of
[00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.390] that
[00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:08.650] bit
[00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:08.970] wrong.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.320] There's
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:11.500] some
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:11.840] secondary
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.300] effects
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:12.500] that
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:12.840] happen
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.360] when
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:13.620] we
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.040] have
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:14.420] rounding
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:14.740] error
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:15.100] and
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.940] overflow
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.220] and
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:16.780] underflow
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.260] errors.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:17.820] What
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.060] happens
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:18.200] is
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:18.460] after
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:18.680] the
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:18.940] first
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:19.200] error,
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:19.400] we
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:19.560] do
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:19.760] some
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:19.960] more
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.300] math,
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:20.600] and
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:20.740] then
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:20.920] the
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.140] second
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:21.380] error
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:21.760] causes
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.460] a
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:22.640] bigger
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.100] problem.
[00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:24.050] So
[00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.210] for
[00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:24.450] example,
[00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:24.650] say
[00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:24.750] we
[00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:24.870] have
[00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:25.030] some
[00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.270] code
[00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.450] that
[00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:25.870] computes
[00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:26.550] x
[00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.810] minus
[00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:27.230] y.
[00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:28.230] x
[00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.430] minus
[00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.790] y
[00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:29.230] is
[00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.630] a
[00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:29.990] relatively
[00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.350] safe
[00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:30.550] thing
[00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.690] to
[00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:30.890] do
[00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:31.070] to
[00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.350] start
[00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:31.630] with.
[00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:32.610] There's
[00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:32.890] definitely
[00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:33.130] some
[00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:33.290] ways
[00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:33.390] it
[00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:33.510] can
[00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.670] go
[00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:33.970] wrong,
[00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:34.150] but
[00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:34.330] there's
[00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:34.470] not
[00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.710] anything
[00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:35.190] fundamentally
[00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.510] wrong
[00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.690] with
[00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.970] doing
[00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:36.110] a
[00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:36.670] subtraction.
[00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:37.390] But
[00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:37.550] now
[00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.850] suppose
[00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:38.010] that
[00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:38.290] x
[00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:38.830] overflows
[00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:39.090] to
[00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:39.350] inf,
[00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:39.730] y
[00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:40.170] overflows
[00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:40.370] to
[00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:40.610] inf.
[00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.490] Well,
[00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.630] then
[00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:41.870] we've
[00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:42.130] got
[00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:42.630] infinity
[00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.050] minus
[00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:43.450] infinity,
[00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:44.450] and
[00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.830] we
[00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:44.990] don't
[00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.190] really
[00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.390] know
[00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:45.610] which
[00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:45.910] infinity
[00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:46.170] is
[00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:46.490] larger.
[00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:47.490] This
[00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:47.710] kind
[00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.790] of
[00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:48.110] operation
[00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:48.310] is
[00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.450] not
[00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:48.650] really
[00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:49.030] defined.
[00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:49.930] So
[00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:50.110] now
[00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:50.270] our
[00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.550] x
[00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.750] minus
[00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.010] y
[00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:51.150] will
[00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.330] turn
[00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:51.530] these
[00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.930] infs
[00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:52.170] into
[00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:52.650] nans.
[00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.830] A
[00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:53.950] lot
[00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:54.030] of
[00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.170] the
[00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:54.450] time
[00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:54.730] when
[00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:54.850] you
[00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:55.070] have
[00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.690] overflow,
[00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:56.470] the
[00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.590] way
[00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:56.690] that
[00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.790] you
[00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:57.110] first
[00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:57.430] see
[00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.650] it
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:58.640] is
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:58.760] that
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:58.900] you'll
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:34:59.020] get
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:34:59.180] a
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:34:59.480] nan
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:34:59.720] in
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:34:59.840] your
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.100] loss
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:00.440] function
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:00.600] or
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:00.740] your
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.020] gradient.
[00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:02.010] So
[00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:02.330] somewhere
[00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:02.590] in
[00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:02.790] your
[00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:03.350] computational
[00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:03.890] graph,
[00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.110] you'll
[00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:04.230] get
[00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.390] an
[00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.690] inf,
[00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:05.370] and
[00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:05.610] then
[00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:05.810] by
[00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.950] the
[00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:06.110] time
[00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:06.230] it
[00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.550] actually
[00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.890] gets
[00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:07.210] printed
[00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:07.550] out
[00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.850] or
[00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:08.270] plotted
[00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.650] somewhere,
[00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.230] it
[00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.350] will
[00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:09.470] have
[00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.610] been
[00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:09.790] turned
[00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:10.010] into
[00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.170] a
[00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:10.390] nan
[00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.590] by
[00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:10.770] these
[00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.110] additional
[00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:11.430] steps
[00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.610] of
[00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:11.930] arithmetic
[00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:12.230] that
[00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.410] came
[00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.790] afterward.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:14.760] One
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:14.840] of
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:14.940] the

[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:15.480] functions
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:15.740] that's
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.040] often
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:16.300] the
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:16.600] culprit
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.180] of

[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:19.800] programs
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.620] is
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.020] the

[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.040] function
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:22.760] that
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.560] computes
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.060] the

[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:29.680] This

[00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.350] and
[00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:54.630] make
[00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.790] sure
[00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.950] that
[00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:55.050] you
[00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:55.490] design
[00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.770] the
[00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:56.210] structure
[00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.770] of
[00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.130] your

[00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:58.070] that
[00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:58.170] you
[00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:58.510] compute
[00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.170] so
[00:35:59.170 --> 00:35:59.330] that
[00:35:59.330 --> 00:35:59.450] they
[00:35:59.450 --> 00:35:59.590] will

[00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.930] exp.
[00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.730] A
[00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:02.870] lot
[00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.970] of
[00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:03.090] the

[00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.390] of
[00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:03.530] this
[00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.790] lecture
[00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.950] will
[00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:04.270] be
[00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:04.750] about
[00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:05.310] ideas
[00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:05.590] for
[00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:05.790] how
[00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:05.930] you
[00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:06.070] can
[00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:06.290] prevent
[00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.550] that
[00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.750] from
[00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.090] happening
[00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:07.790] in
[00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:08.130] specific
[00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:08.550] cases.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.380] The
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:10.540] other
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:10.740] big
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:10.940] problem
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.120] with
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:11.420] exp
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:11.720] is
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.100] that
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:12.520] if
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:12.920] your
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.720] argument
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:13.960] to
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.080] it
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:14.200] is
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:14.420] very
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:14.980] negative,
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:15.840] exp
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.000] of
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.220] x
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:16.420] can
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:16.960] underflow.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:17.820] This
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.080] may
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:18.220] not
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:18.360] be
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:18.480] a
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:18.760] problem.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:18.960] If
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.040] you
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:19.240] think
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:19.500] about
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.020] it,
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:20.920] exp
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.080] of
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:21.200] a
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:21.400] very
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:21.720] negative
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.040] number
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:22.440] is
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:22.940] just
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.200] some
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:23.640] small
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:23.940] number
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.260] epsilon,
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.020] and
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:25.100] if
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.240] you
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:25.680] round
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.100] that
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:26.320] number
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:26.500] down
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:26.640] to
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:26.840] zero,
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.160] you've
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:27.320] only
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:27.480] made
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:27.580] a
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:27.860] mistake
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:28.020] of
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:28.240] size
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:28.600] epsilon.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:29.560] So
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.400] if
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:30.540] that
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:30.680] was
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:30.820] your
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.180] final
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:31.500] output
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:31.640] of
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:31.760] the
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.040] function,
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:32.280] it's
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:32.420] not
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:32.520] a
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:32.640] very
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:32.880] big
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.120] error.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.440] Unfortunately,
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:34.960] if
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.500] you
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:35.720] then
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:35.920] do
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.220] other
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:36.540] math
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:36.700] on
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:36.900] top
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.020] of
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.180] this
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:37.580] output,
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:38.660] rounding
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.100] a
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:39.300] small
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:39.520] number
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:39.800] epsilon
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.120] down
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:40.260] to
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:40.420] zero
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:40.580] can
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:40.760] be
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.300] catastrophic.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.260] If
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:42.540] you're
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:42.860] using
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:43.160] exp
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:43.300] of
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:43.520] x
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:43.720] in
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:43.860] a
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:44.280] denominator
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.180] or
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:45.560] as
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:45.680] an
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:45.940] argument
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:46.140] to
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:46.260] a
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:46.660] logarithm
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:46.840] and
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.000] so
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.180] on,
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:47.440] it
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:47.580] can
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:47.800] cause
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:47.980] really
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:48.200] big
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:48.560] problems.
[00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.970] Another
[00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:51.330] case
[00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:51.670] where
[00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.010] you
[00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.190] can
[00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.610] sometimes
[00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:53.010] encounter
[00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:53.390] danger
[00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.690] is
[00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.810] when
[00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.910] you
[00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:54.230] have
[00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.450] subtraction,
[00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:56.070] especially
[00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:56.650] if
[00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:56.910] you
[00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:57.190] want
[00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.510] to
[00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.810] guarantee
[00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:58.470] that
[00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.210] the
[00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:00.130] output
[00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:00.290] of
[00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.390] the
[00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.950] subtraction
[00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:01.310] is
[00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:01.490] going
[00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.570] to
[00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:01.690] be
[00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:02.050] positive.
[00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.850] So
[00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:02.950] if
[00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:03.030] you
[00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.210] have
[00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:03.490] two
[00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:04.130] values
[00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:04.430] x
[00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.570] and
[00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:04.850] y
[00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:05.450] and
[00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.550] you
[00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.790] know
[00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:06.690] algebraically
[00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:06.990] that
[00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.070] you
[00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:07.230] can
[00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.610] prove
[00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:07.790] that
[00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:08.010] x
[00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:08.130] is
[00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:08.310] always
[00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.530] greater
[00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:08.710] than
[00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.990] y,
[00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.870] in
[00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:09.970] a
[00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:10.370] computer
[00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.690] you
[00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:10.830] may
[00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:11.070] actually
[00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:11.330] find
[00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:11.470] that
[00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.730] x
[00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:11.970] minus
[00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:12.270] y
[00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.570] ends
[00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:12.710] up
[00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.890] being
[00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:13.270] negative.
[00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:14.070] So
[00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:14.170] if
[00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:14.250] you
[00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:14.590] relied
[00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:14.770] on
[00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:14.990] x
[00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.190] minus
[00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.490] y
[00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:15.830] being
[00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:16.290] positive
[00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:17.290] in
[00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:17.750] subsequent
[00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:18.130] steps
[00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:18.270] of
[00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.390] your
[00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.750] program,
[00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:18.890] you
[00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.990] could
[00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.130] run
[00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.290] into
[00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:19.610] trouble.
[00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:20.490] One
[00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:20.670] case
[00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:20.790] where
[00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.870] we
[00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:21.010] see
[00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:21.170] this
[00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.290] a
[00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.450] lot
[00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:21.710] is
[00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:22.070] computing
[00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:22.290] the
[00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:22.710] variance.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:23.860] So
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.120] there's
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:24.460] one
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:24.660] way
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:24.860] that
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.020] you
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.260] can
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:25.500] write
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:25.680] the
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:26.040] variance
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:26.360] where
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:26.540] it's
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:26.760] the
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.400] expectation
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.260] of
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:28.440] a
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:28.800] squared
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.220] value.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:30.100] If
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:30.240] you
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:30.500] implement
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:30.680] the
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:30.940] variance
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:31.140] this
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:31.380] way
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:31.480] in
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:31.620] your
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:31.940] code,
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:32.820] it's
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.000] always
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.200] going
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:33.300] to
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:33.460] give
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:33.580] you
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:33.960] positive
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:34.420] numbers
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:35.480] because
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:35.880] the
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.140] output
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:36.320] of
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:36.720] the
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.240] squaring
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:37.540] value
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:37.840] will
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.300] always
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:38.660] be
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.300] non
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:39.620]-negative.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:39.920] I
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.180] shouldn't
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:40.320] say
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:40.700] positive,
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:41.000] sorry.
[00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.570] And
[00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:43.830] then
[00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:44.210] if
[00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.410] you
[00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:44.650] look
[00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:44.890] at
[00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:45.190] the
[00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.670] difference
[00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.290] between
[00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:47.710] the
[00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:48.310] expectation
[00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.690] of
[00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:48.810] the
[00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:49.030] squared
[00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.230] value
[00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.330] of
[00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:49.430] the
[00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.710] function
[00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.710] and
[00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:51.410] the
[00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:52.030] square
[00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.290] of
[00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:52.410] the
[00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:52.730] expected
[00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:52.970] value
[00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:53.070] of
[00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:53.150] the
[00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.450] function,
[00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.890] algebraically
[00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:55.150] that's
[00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.290] a
[00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:55.650] perfectly
[00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:56.010] valid
[00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:56.350] way
[00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:56.650] of
[00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:57.070] rearranging
[00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:57.310] this
[00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:57.670] expression
[00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.830] for
[00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:57.950] the
[00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:58.350] variance.
[00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.930] And
[00:37:58.930 --> 00:37:59.030] a
[00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.110] lot
[00:37:59.110 --> 00:37:59.190] of
[00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.330] time
[00:37:59.330 --> 00:37:59.490] this
[00:37:59.490 --> 00:37:59.610] is
[00:37:59.610 --> 00:37:59.870] actually
[00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:00.030] the
[00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.270] one
[00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.570] where
[00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:00.910] we
[00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:01.750] actually
[00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.990] have
[00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.310] access
[00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:02.570] to
[00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:02.750] those
[00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:03.050] values
[00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.250] to
[00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:03.510] compute
[00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.730] it.
[00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:05.070] Unfortunately
[00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:05.830] it's
[00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:06.450] numerically
[00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:06.950] unstable
[00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:07.430] because
[00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.870] if
[00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.950] we
[00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:08.030] have

[00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:09.510] and

[00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:10.230] error
[00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.350] on

[00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:11.830] and
[00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:12.250] these
[00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:12.570] values
[00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:12.690] were
[00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:12.950] very
[00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:13.190] close
[00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.350] to
[00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:13.510] zero
[00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.690] to

[00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.250] error
[00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:15.470] goes
[00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.550] in
[00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.650] the
[00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:15.810] wrong
[00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:16.230] direction
[00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.510] we
[00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:16.630] can

[00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.850] up
[00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:17.050] with
[00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:17.290] a

[00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:20.550] And
[00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.670] that
[00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.830] can
[00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:21.070] cause
[00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:21.410] trouble
[00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.890] especially
[00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:22.150] if
[00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.230] you
[00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.350] were
[00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:22.590] planning
[00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:22.810] to

[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.300] functions
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:31.620] where
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:31.900] you
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:32.080] want

[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:32.480] very
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:32.780] careful.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:33.540] The

[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:34.120] of
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:34.320] zero
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:34.660] is

[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:37.600] number
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.180] is

[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:42.340] as
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:42.520] a
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:42.740] not
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:42.840] a
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.120] number.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:45.280] The
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:45.500] square
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:45.580] root
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:45.680] of
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:45.940] zero
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.200] is
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:46.460] zero
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:46.640] so
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:46.840] that's
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.060] actually
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:47.480] safe,
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.000] but
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.220] the
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:48.680] derivative
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:48.980] of
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:49.240] square
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:49.720] root
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.300] has
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:50.440] a
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:50.760] divide
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:50.980] by
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.300] zero
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:51.860] if
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:51.960] you
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.180] take
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:52.340] the
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:52.660] derivative
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:52.900] at
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.100] x
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:53.300] equals
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:53.600] zero.
[00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:54.570] So
[00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:54.670] you
[00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.010] definitely
[00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.250] want
[00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.350] to
[00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:55.570] avoid
[00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:56.130] underflow
[00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:56.850] or
[00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:57.510] rounding
[00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.750] to
[00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.870] a
[00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:58.130] negative
[00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.490] value
[00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:59.050] in
[00:38:59.050 --> 00:38:59.170] the
[00:38:59.170 --> 00:38:59.450] argument
[00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.710] to
[00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.950] either
[00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:00.250] log
[00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:00.430] or
[00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:00.690] square
[00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:00.930] root.
[00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.810] One
[00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:02.030] very
[00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.290] common
[00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:02.570] place
[00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:02.710] where
[00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.830] this
[00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:03.090] comes
[00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:03.330] up
[00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:03.590] is
[00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:03.710] when
[00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.830] we
[00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:04.150] compute
[00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.390] the
[00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.610] standard
[00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:05.130] deviation.
[00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.890] The
[00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:06.090] standard
[00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:06.450] deviation
[00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:06.710] is
[00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.870] the
[00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:07.030] square
[00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.170] root
[00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:07.270] of
[00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.390] the
[00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.810] variance.
[00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:08.570] So
[00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:08.650] if
[00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:08.750] you
[00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:09.010] compute
[00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:09.170] the
[00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:09.470] variance
[00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.770] using
[00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.990] the
[00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.370] dangerous
[00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.830] strategy
[00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:11.170] from
[00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:11.390] this
[00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.670] slide
[00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.450] you
[00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:12.610] can
[00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:12.750] end
[00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:12.930] up
[00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:13.150] with
[00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.350] this
[00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:13.710] rounding
[00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.990] to
[00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.150] a
[00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.390] small
[00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.690] negative
[00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:15.030] number
[00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.670] and
[00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.770] then
[00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.870] you
[00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:16.010] take
[00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.170] the
[00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:16.330] square
[00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:16.470] root
[00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.550] of
[00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.690] that
[00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:16.970] small
[00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:17.270] negative
[00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.570] number
[00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:17.710] and
[00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.850] run
[00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:18.030] into
[00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.290] trouble.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:20.480] The
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.080] logarithm
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.500] of
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:21.820] x
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.340] is
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:22.720] a
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.200] common
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:23.500] pattern
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:23.700] that
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:23.900] comes
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.060] up
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:24.180] a
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:24.280] lot
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:24.420] in
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:24.620] deep
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:24.840] learning.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:25.440] We
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:25.640] often
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:25.820] see
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:25.960] this
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.060] when
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:26.180] we're
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:26.460] computing
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:26.800] log
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.360] probabilities
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:27.700] and
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:27.840] the
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.220] probability
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:28.460] is
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:28.740] based
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.080] on
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.860] taking
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:30.060] the
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:30.300] exp
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.460] of
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:30.660] some
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:30.980] argument.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:31.820] Whenever
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:32.040] you
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:32.220] see
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:32.460] this
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:32.600] you
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:32.760] should
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.220] simplify
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:33.600] it
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:33.940] to
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:34.300] just
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:34.460] the
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:34.700] value
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.160] x.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.060] Theano
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:36.240] will
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:36.360] do
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:36.540] this
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:36.680] for
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:36.800] you
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.280] automatically,
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:37.940] a
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:38.060] lot
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:38.180] of
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:38.440] frameworks
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:38.860] don't.
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:40.420] And
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:40.680] if
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:40.780] you
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:40.940] do
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:41.180] this
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:41.340] you
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:41.460] can
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:41.740] avoid
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.280] overflowing
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:42.500] the
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:42.820] exp
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.520] because
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.040] you
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.240] just
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:44.480] take
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:44.840] x
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.180] rather
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.450] than
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:46.940] computing
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.340] exp
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:47.500] of
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:47.720] x
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.080] first
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:48.400] before
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:48.700] computing
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:48.860] the
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:49.020] log.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:49.760] You
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:49.860] can
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.100] also
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:50.600] avoid
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.480] underflow
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.240] in
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:52.600] exp
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:52.880] which
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.140] then
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:53.560] cause
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:53.820] the
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.260] logarithm
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:54.680] to
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.920] turn
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.100] into
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.400] negative
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:56.680] inf.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:39:59.780] So
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:39:59.900] now
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:39:59.980] I
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:00.060] have
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:00.140] a
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:00.260] little
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:00.400] bit
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:00.480] of
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:00.600] an

[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.300] for
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:01.520] you.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:02.480] Let's
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:02.580] say
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:02.680] that
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.080] we're
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:03.320] doing
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:03.440] a
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:03.520] little
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:03.640] bit
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:03.740] of
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:03.880] a
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.160] hack
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:04.560] to
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.300] avoid
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.280] a
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:06.600] divide
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:06.800] by
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.140] zero.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:07.860] We
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.080] want
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.240] to
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:08.660] take
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:09.020] a
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.520] normalized,
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:10.580] we
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:10.660] want
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:10.720] to
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:10.940] compute
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:11.060] a
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:11.260] normalized
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:11.620] version
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:11.760] of
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.020] x
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.280] where
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:12.520] x
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:12.700] will
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.480] have
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:13.740] unit
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:14.040] standard
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:14.520] deviation
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.560] and
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.060] we
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:16.520] divide
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:16.920] x
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.380] by
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:17.700] some
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.040] estimate
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:18.180] of
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:18.300] the
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:18.480] standard
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:18.900] deviation
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.140] in
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:19.260] order
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:19.420] to
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:19.560] do
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:19.800] that.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.320] We
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:21.500] know
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:21.640] that
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:21.820] our
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.060] standard
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:22.460] deviation
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.040] might
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.380] have
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:23.760] some
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.440] round
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:24.640] to
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:24.880] zero
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.200] trouble
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:25.420] so
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:25.540] we're
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:25.640] going
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:25.800] to
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.060] add
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:26.240] a
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:26.440] small
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:26.860] constant
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.280] epsilon
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.400] of
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:28.680] 10
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:28.780] to
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:28.860] the
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.040] minus
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:29.400] 7
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.120] to
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:30.320] our
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:30.580] standard
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.020] deviation
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:31.660] in
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:31.780] order
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:31.900] to
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:32.020] make
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:32.140] sure
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:32.300] we
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:32.560] don't
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:32.960] divide
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.160] by
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:33.440] zero
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.120] when
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:34.240] we
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:34.500] compute
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:34.680] the
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:34.920] normalized
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.260] version
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:35.400] of
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:35.680] x.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:37.720] So
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:37.880] there's
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.040] two
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:38.220] different
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:38.400] ways
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:38.520] we
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:38.620] can
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:38.860] imagine
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.080] doing
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:39.420] this.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:39.740] One
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:39.920] is
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.040] we
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:40.140] could
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:40.340] take
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:40.520] the
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:40.740] square
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:40.980] root
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:41.360] of
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:41.720] epsilon
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.060] plus
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:42.220] the
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:42.560] variance
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.280] and
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:43.460] use
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:43.620] that
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:43.740] as
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:43.840] our
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.080] standard
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.480] deviation.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.320] The
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:45.460] other
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:45.680] version
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:45.780] of
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:45.900] the
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.160] hack
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:46.480] is
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:46.580] we
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:46.700] could
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.080] take
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:47.640] epsilon
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.140] plus
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:48.300] the
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:48.420] square
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:48.600] root
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:48.700] of
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:48.780] the
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.100] variance.
[00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:50.630] So
[00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.810] which
[00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.990] of
[00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.250] these
[00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:51.570] is
[00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:51.810] the
[00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:52.090] better
[00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:52.270] way
[00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.370] to
[00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.630] implement
[00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.890] this
[00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:53.150] hack?
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:55.540] Does
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:55.760] anybody
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.000] want
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:56.100] to
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:56.380] answer
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:56.740] on
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:56.860] the
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:57.100] chat?
[00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:01.530] The
[00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:01.830] first
[00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:02.050] one.
[00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.750] So
[00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:03.070] why
[00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:03.190] do
[00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.250] you
[00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:03.350] say
[00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:03.470] the
[00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.670] first
[00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.870] one?
[00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.590] Oh
[00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:04.630] you
[00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.750] got
[00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.870] to
[00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:05.030] vote
[00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.190] for
[00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.370] the
[00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:05.550] second
[00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.750] one
[00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.890] as
[00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:06.070] well.
[00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.950] So
[00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:07.330] does
[00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:07.530] somebody
[00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:07.670] want
[00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.730] to
[00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:07.990] give
[00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.330] a
[00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:08.650] reason
[00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:08.850] for
[00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:08.970] one
[00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:09.050] of
[00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.150] their
[00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.430] votes?
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:15.440] So
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:15.660] the
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:15.900] square
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:16.180] root
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:16.460] of
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:16.760] eps
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:16.960] will
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.140] be
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:17.380] too
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:17.780] small.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:18.440] That
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:18.740] can
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.100] definitely
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:19.500] happen
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:19.900] if
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:20.760] your
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.160] eps
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:21.340] is
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:21.740] already
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.200] just
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:22.460] barely
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:22.680] as
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:22.900] big
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:23.060] as
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:23.180] you
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:23.300] can
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:23.680] represent
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:23.840] and
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.120] variance
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.300] is
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:24.520] zero,
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:25.040] it
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:25.180] can
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:25.380] round
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:25.620] down.
[00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:28.970] There's
[00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:29.150] also
[00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.430] another
[00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.810] issue
[00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:30.150] here
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.740] which
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.260] is
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.300] think
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:34.720] about
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:34.980] what
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.520] happens
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.180] if
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:36.660] the
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:37.280] variance
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:37.560] is
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:37.840] already
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.180] implemented
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:38.620] safely
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.300] and
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:39.400] we
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:39.580] know
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:39.740] that
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:39.880] it
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.180] won't
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:40.560] get
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:40.800] rounded
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.120] down
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:41.380] too
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:41.640] low.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:43.860] Let's
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.260] also
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:44.580] suppose
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:44.720] we
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:44.880] make
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.160] epsilon
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:45.340] a
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:45.480] little
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:45.680] bit
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:45.940] bigger
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:46.520] so
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:46.760] if
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.000] we
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.660] divide
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:47.860] by
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.160] square
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:48.320] root
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:48.440] of

[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.000] that
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:49.140] won't
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:49.260] give
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:49.400] us
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:49.660] divide
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:49.840] by
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.120] zero.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:50.880] Is
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:50.980] there
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:51.120] any

[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:52.200] up
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:52.340] here?
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:55.380] So
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:55.480] there
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:55.640] is
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:55.920] one
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.100] other
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:56.360] problem
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:56.480] that
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:56.640] might
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:56.820] come

[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:58.660] If
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:58.760] we
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:58.920] use
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.200] this
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:41:59.640] version
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.360] where
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:01.960] we
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.300] have
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:02.860] the

[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:03.640] plus

[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:06.860] get,
[00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:08.890] when
[00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:09.030] we
[00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.350] compute

[00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:12.270] we
[00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.370] can
[00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:12.490] have
[00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:12.630] this
[00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.850] problem
[00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:12.970] that

[00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.870] might
[00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:15.310] be
[00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:15.850] evaluated
[00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:16.510] exactly
[00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.110] for

[00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:20.090] zero
[00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.250] and
[00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:22.190] when
[00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.330] we
[00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:22.490] take
[00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.650] the
[00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:22.930] derivative
[00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:23.170] of

[00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:23.670] root
[00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.310] we
[00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:24.570] actually
[00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:24.750] get
[00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.890] a
[00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:25.170] divide
[00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:25.350] by

[00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:25.750] in
[00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.890] that
[00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:26.230] case.
[00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.410] So
[00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:27.690] usually
[00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:27.850] you
[00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:27.990] want
[00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.110] to
[00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:28.370] put
[00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.150] the

[00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:30.830] root
[00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:31.410] but
[00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:31.510] you
[00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.670] do
[00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.790] need
[00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.910] to
[00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:32.030] make
[00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.190] sure
[00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.330] that
[00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:32.450] your
[00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:32.790] epsilon
[00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:33.070] is
[00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:33.270] big
[00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.470] enough
[00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.690] that
[00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:33.790] it
[00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:33.930] won't
[00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:34.110] get
[00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:34.370] rounded
[00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.590] down
[00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:34.730] to
[00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:34.890] zero
[00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:35.110] when
[00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:35.210] you
[00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.370] take
[00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:35.510] the
[00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.690] square
[00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.910] root.
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.180] Another

[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:38.620] that
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:38.820] comes
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.000] up
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.540] all
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:39.700] the

[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.400] is

[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:42.760] exp.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:43.660] You
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:43.860] see
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.040] this
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:44.180] in
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:44.380] things
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:44.580] like
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:44.740] the

[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:45.260] entropy
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:45.780] function.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.240] The
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:47.540] naive
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:47.840] way
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.060] of

[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:48.720] this
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:48.920] is
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.040] if
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:49.100] you
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:49.220] have
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:49.320] an
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:49.620] array
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:50.540] you
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:50.880] take
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.060] you
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:51.300] apply
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:51.720] exp

[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.040] the
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:52.320] array
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:52.940] then
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:53.120] you
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:53.380] sum
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:53.540] out
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:53.700] the

[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:54.440] values
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:54.780] and
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:54.900] then
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.000] you
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.160] take
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:55.320] the
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:55.580] log
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:55.940] at

[00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:58.040] The

[00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:58.840] modes
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.000] to
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.320] this
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:42:59.660] are,
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.000] there's
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.200] two

[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:00.600] ways
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:00.700] it
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:00.800] can
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:00.980] go
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:01.240] wrong.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.060] One
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:02.220] is
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:02.420] if
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:02.880] any
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.100] of
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:03.200] your
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:03.460] entries
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:03.600] in
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:03.700] the
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:03.880] array
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.080] is
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:04.380] big
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.100] your
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:05.600] exp
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:05.920] can
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.380] overflow.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:07.660] So
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:07.760] you
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:07.920] just
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.140] take
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:08.500] exp

[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.260] 32
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:11.680] you
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:11.780] know
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.080] a

[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:12.940] would
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:13.100] do
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:13.320] this
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:13.480] to
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:13.700] you.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.360] You
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.020] overflow,
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:16.760] now
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:16.940] you've
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:17.060] got
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:17.200] an
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:17.440] inf
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:17.760] here.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:18.380] When
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:18.500] you
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:18.720] start
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.060] doing
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:19.440] arithmetic
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:19.760] on
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:19.900] the
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:20.220] inf
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:20.680] it's
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:20.980] probably
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:21.120] going
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:21.220] to
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:21.340] turn
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:21.520] into
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:21.700] a
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:21.920] noun
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.240] pretty
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:22.560] soon.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:24.980] And
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.320] that
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:25.560] one's
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:25.940] relatively
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:26.300] obvious.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:26.480] A
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:26.560] lot
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:26.660] of
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:26.840] people
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.160] realize
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:27.260] that
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:27.400] that
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:27.560] one's
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:27.680] going
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:27.800] to
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.060] happen.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:29.300] Another
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:29.680] case
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:29.780] that
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:29.920] this
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:30.080] can
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:30.440] fail
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:30.880] is
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.120] if
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.180] all
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:32.380] of

[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.100] negative
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:35.520] then
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:35.800] all
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:35.940] of
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:36.080] the

[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:37.260] to
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:37.500] zero.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:39.420] Individually
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:39.700] each
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:39.800] of

[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.260] mistakes
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:40.400] in

[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:41.320] big
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:41.580] deal.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:42.520] The

[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:43.840] number
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:44.120] is
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:44.400] some

[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.280] epsilon.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.040] You
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:46.240] round
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:46.380] that
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:46.500] to
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:46.780] zero
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:47.140] your

[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:47.640] is
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:47.900] only
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.620] order
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:48.820] of

[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:49.780] Your
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:50.320] error
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:50.460] is
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:50.580] only
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:50.940] exactly
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:51.320] epsilon.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:52.580] The
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:52.780] problem
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:52.920] is
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.020] when
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:53.180] you
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:53.420] sum
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:53.580] up
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:53.740] all
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:53.900] the
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.220] zeros
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:54.600] if
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:54.760] all
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:54.860] of
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:54.940] them
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:55.080] are
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:55.420] literally
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:55.800] zero
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.000] then
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.140] the
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:56.320] sum
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:56.440] is
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:56.660] also
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:56.980] literally
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:57.360] zero
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.080] and
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:58.200] then
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:58.300] you
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:58.540] pass
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:58.680] that
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:58.820] to
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:58.940] a
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:43:59.180] log.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:43:59.980] So
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:00.100] you
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:00.260] get
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:00.380] a
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:00.640] negative
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:00.940] inf
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:01.140] at
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:01.300] the
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:01.500] end
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.280] even
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:02.520] if
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:02.900] that's
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:03.780] not
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:04.800] algebraically
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.000] the
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:05.280] correct
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:05.660] answer.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.320] So
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:07.420] the
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:07.540] good
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:07.680] news
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:07.900] is
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.160] there's
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:08.240] a
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:08.480] relatively
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:08.900] simple
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.220] trick
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:09.440] that
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:09.600] lets
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:09.740] us
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:09.940] fix
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:10.260] this.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:11.600] The
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:11.720] way
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:11.820] it
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:11.980] works
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:12.080] is
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:12.200] we
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:12.400] take
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:12.560] the
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:12.880] maximum
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.400] of
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:13.540] the
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:13.760] array
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.700] and
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:14.840] then
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.020] we
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:15.320] subtract
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:15.680] the
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:15.980] maximum
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.420] off
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:16.700] all

[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:16.920] the
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:17.240] entries.
[00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:18.510] Then
[00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:18.610] we
[00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:18.910] compute
[00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:19.250] log
[00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.490] sum
[00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.810] exp
[00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:20.510] of

[00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.990] array
[00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.170] that
[00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:22.270] had
[00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.410] the
[00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:22.670] max
[00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:23.230] subtracted
[00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:23.390] off
[00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.510] of
[00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.610] it
[00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:24.590] and
[00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:24.730] we
[00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:24.990] add
[00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.150] the
[00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.570] max
[00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:25.970] back
[00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:26.230] on
[00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.350] to
[00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:26.450] the

[00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:27.230] after
[00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.410] we
[00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:27.590] take
[00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:27.750] the

[00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:38.010] Someone
[00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:38.190] was
[00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.490] saying
[00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:39.090] don't
[00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.190] all
[00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.310] the
[00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:39.470] deep
[00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.650] learning
[00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:39.950] frameworks
[00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:40.210] already
[00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:40.510] solve
[00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.810] this.
[00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.510] Well
[00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.910] a
[00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.990] lot
[00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.070] of
[00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:42.190] them
[00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.450] provide
[00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:42.850] solutions
[00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:43.070] to
[00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:43.170] it
[00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:43.270] but
[00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.350] you
[00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:43.490] have
[00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:43.590] to
[00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:43.690] know
[00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:43.790] to
[00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.990] use
[00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.190] those
[00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.610] solutions.
[00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:45.770] So
[00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.930] whenever
[00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:46.070] you
[00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:46.210] see
[00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:46.450] yourself
[00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:46.630] doing
[00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.730] a
[00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.890] log
[00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:47.070] sum
[00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:47.350] exp
[00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:47.710] be
[00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.950] sure
[00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:48.150] to
[00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.450] use
[00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:48.710] the
[00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.950] stable
[00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:49.230] variant
[00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:49.390] of
[00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.610] it.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:51.900] If
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:52.000] we
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:52.100] look
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:52.220] at
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:52.380] why
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:52.540] this
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:52.900] works,
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:53.360] first
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:53.660] off
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:53.940] we
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:54.080] need
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:54.160] to
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:54.300] make
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:54.460] sure
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:54.680] that
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.140] we're
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:55.380] actually
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:55.760] computing
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:55.940] the
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:56.140] value
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:56.280] that
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:56.380] we
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:56.640] want.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.100] We
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:57.240] want
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:57.340] to
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:57.480] see
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:57.660] that
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:57.920] the
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.120] new
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:58.520] expression
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:58.760] is
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:44:59.480] algebraically
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.000] equivalent
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.220] to
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:00.340] the
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:00.520] old
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:00.700] one.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:01.660] So
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:01.760] the
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:01.860] way
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:01.980] we
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:02.100] can
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.260] see
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:02.540] this
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:02.920] is
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.280] we've
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:03.400] got
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:03.600] this
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:03.960] variable
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:04.320] m
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:04.720] representing
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:04.940] the
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.220] max.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:05.900] We've
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:06.020] got
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:06.200] this
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:06.440] vector
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:06.740] a
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:07.180] representing
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:07.380] the
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:07.640] array.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:08.960] The
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.200] new
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:09.440] value
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:09.560] that
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:09.680] we're
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:09.980] computing
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:10.400] is
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:10.720] m
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.140] plus
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.080] log
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:12.460] sum
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:12.720] over

[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:13.440] of

[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:14.500] minus
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:14.780] m.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:15.880] Well
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.120] each
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:16.260] of
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:16.480] these
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.040] exp
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.500] terms
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.160] we
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:18.280] can
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:18.440] use
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:18.580] the
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:18.840] fact
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:19.200] that
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:19.860] exp
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.320] of
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.100] ai
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:21.420] minus
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:21.780] m
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.600] turns
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.060] into
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:23.400] exp
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:23.560] of
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:23.880] ai
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.340] divided
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:24.560] by

[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:24.940] of
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:25.120] m
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:25.780] and
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:25.900] so
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.180] we've
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:26.660] simplified
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.080] these
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:28.360] terms
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:28.700] inside
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:28.900] the
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.080] sum.
[00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:30.090] Now
[00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:30.230] it
[00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.430] turns
[00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:30.650] out
[00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:30.930] that
[00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:31.490] every
[00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.170] term
[00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:32.470] in
[00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.670] the
[00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.990] sum
[00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.410] has
[00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.730] this
[00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:34.150] factor
[00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:35.430] division
[00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.730] by
[00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:36.050] exp
[00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.190] of
[00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.450] m
[00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:37.350] and
[00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:37.970] this
[00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:38.290] factor
[00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:38.590] doesn't
[00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:38.890] depend
[00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:39.110] on
[00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:39.370] i
[00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:39.550] at
[00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:39.750] all.
[00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.250] So
[00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.310] we
[00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:40.410] can
[00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:40.630] actually
[00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.930] pull
[00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:41.070] it
[00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:41.570] outside
[00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:41.830] the
[00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:42.130] summation.
[00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.950] So
[00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:43.110] now
[00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:43.270] we've
[00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.550] got
[00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.290] this
[00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:44.730] one
[00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:44.950] over

[00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:45.490] m
[00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:45.970] factor
[00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:46.810] multiplied
[00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:47.350] by
[00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:47.670] this
[00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:48.090] summation
[00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:48.610] factor.
[00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:49.430] Well
[00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.570] a
[00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:49.890] logarithm
[00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:50.030] of
[00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.190] two
[00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.570] factors
[00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:51.050] can
[00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.350] be
[00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:51.770] split
[00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:53.030] into
[00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.930] the

[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:55.700] of
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:55.840] the

[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.320] of
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:56.480] both
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:56.660] those
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.080] factors.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:58.660] The
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:45:59.160] logarithm
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:45:59.660] of
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:45:59.940] one
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:00.140] over
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:00.500] exp
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:00.880] is
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.200] actually
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:01.480] just
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:01.900] negative
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:02.560] log
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:02.700] of
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:02.960] exp.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:03.620] So
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:03.720] we
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:03.860] get
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.100] m
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:04.400] minus

[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.120] over
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:07.240] all
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:07.380] these
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:07.720] factors.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:08.540] This
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:08.800] log
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.060] exp
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:09.500] obviously
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:09.800] that
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.140] turns
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:10.640] into
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.440] the
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:11.780] identity
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:12.000] so
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:12.080] we
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:12.300] get
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.580] m
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:13.840] minus
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.140] m.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:14.480] This
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.000] cancels
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.680] and
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.380] oh
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:16.500] I
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:16.720] actually
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:16.820] have
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:16.900] a
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:17.160] mistake.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:17.280] I
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:17.400] left
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:17.520] out
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:17.620] the
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:17.820] log
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:17.980] here
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:18.100] but
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:18.220] there
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:18.300] should
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:18.400] be
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:18.520] a
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:18.660] log
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:18.820] right
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:19.060] there.
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:21.100] So
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:21.260] we've
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:21.460] actually
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:21.900] recovered
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.780] the
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.400] original
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:23.820] version
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.140] of
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:24.300] the
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:24.680] expression
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:24.880] that
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:24.960] we
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:25.040] were
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:25.160] trying
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:25.280] to
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:25.600] optimize.
[00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:28.750] So
[00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:29.110] the
[00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:29.270] other
[00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.410] thing
[00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:29.510] we
[00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.630] need
[00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.750] to
[00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.970] check
[00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:30.170] to
[00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:30.330] see
[00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:30.470] that
[00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.650] this
[00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.990] works
[00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.050] is
[00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:32.490] we
[00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:32.650] need
[00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:32.770] to
[00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:32.950] make
[00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:33.130] sure
[00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:33.330] that
[00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:33.610] the
[00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:34.110] two
[00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:34.470] failure
[00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.750] modes
[00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.870] we
[00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:35.130] identified
[00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:35.590] earlier
[00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:35.790] are
[00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.990] gone.
[00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.690] So
[00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:36.790] we
[00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.990] notice
[00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:37.190] that
[00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.530] there's
[00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:37.930] a
[00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:38.250] way
[00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:38.350] that
[00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:38.490] we
[00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:38.670] can
[00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:39.170] overflow
[00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.370] the
[00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:39.650] original
[00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.970] version.
[00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:40.650] We've
[00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:40.970] also
[00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:41.430] noticed
[00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.770] that
[00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:41.890] there
[00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:42.010] was
[00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:42.090] a
[00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:42.190] way
[00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.290] we
[00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:42.410] could
[00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:43.050] underflow
[00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:43.430] every
[00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.770] term
[00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:43.890] of
[00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:43.990] the
[00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.230] original
[00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:44.550] version
[00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.710] and
[00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.830] then
[00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:44.970] get
[00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:45.090] a
[00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:45.310] negative
[00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:45.590] int
[00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:46.330] when
[00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:46.410] we
[00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:46.630] pass
[00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.710] it
[00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.810] to
[00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:46.910] the
[00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:47.110] log.
[00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:47.990] So
[00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.190] first
[00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.370] let's
[00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:48.470] look
[00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.550] at
[00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.690] the
[00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:49.050] overflow
[00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:49.490] case.
[00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.470] Because
[00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.670] we
[00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.950] subtract
[00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:51.350] off
[00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:51.550] the
[00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:51.890] max
[00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:52.850] all
[00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:52.970] of
[00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:53.070] the
[00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:53.310] entries
[00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:53.490] of
[00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:53.770] safe
[00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:54.070] array
[00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:54.390] are
[00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.550] at
[00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.810] most
[00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:55.290] zero.
[00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:56.490] Exp
[00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:56.630] of
[00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.830] zero
[00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:57.030] is
[00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.230] just
[00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.550] one
[00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:57.810] so
[00:46:57.810 --> 00:46:57.930] we
[00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:58.070] can
[00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:58.350] compute
[00:46:58.350 --> 00:46:58.590] that
[00:46:58.590 --> 00:46:58.770] without
[00:46:58.770 --> 00:46:59.050] any
[00:46:59.050 --> 00:46:59.410] overflow.
[00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:00.130] So
[00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:00.290] we've
[00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.630] eliminated
[00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.890] the
[00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:01.250] overflow
[00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.690] problem.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.140] Next
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:03.400] there
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:03.540] was
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:03.680] the
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:03.940] case
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:04.300] where
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:05.060] every
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:05.520] value
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:05.700] of
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:05.820] the
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.060] exp
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:06.720] underflows.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:07.700] Well
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:07.880] we
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.040] can
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:08.280] still
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:08.420] have
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:08.520] a
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:08.760] problem
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:08.960] where
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.280] some
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:09.420] of
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:09.520] the
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:09.760] exp
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.100] terms
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:10.700] underflow.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:11.860] The
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:12.060] good
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:12.260] news
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:12.660] is
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.660] subtracting
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:13.820] off
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:13.940] the
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:14.340] max
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:15.380] actually
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:15.780] means
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:16.180] that
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:16.320] there
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:16.520] has
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:16.620] to
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:16.740] be
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:16.900] at
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:17.180] least
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:17.460] one
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:17.700] entry
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:17.840] of
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.060] safe
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:18.260] array
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:18.560] that's
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:18.720] equal
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:18.900] to
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.160] zero.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:20.340] Any
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:20.660] entries
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:20.780] that
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:20.860] were
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:21.100] tied
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:21.260] for
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:21.400] the
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:21.660] max
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:21.900] now
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.060] have
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:22.140] a
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:22.340] value
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:22.480] of
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:22.720] zero
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.480] and
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:23.640] so
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:23.840] those
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:23.940] are
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:24.080] not
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:24.240] going
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:24.340] to
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:24.720] underflow
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:24.860] when
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:24.940] we
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:25.080] take
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:25.240] the
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:25.500] x.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:25.940] They'll
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:26.080] get
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:26.180] a
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:26.360] value
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:26.520] of
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:26.740] one
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:26.860] and
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:27.020] that's
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:27.120] a
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:27.380] nice
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.180] stable
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:28.480] value
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:28.660] that
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:28.780] can
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:28.920] be
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.200] computed
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:29.600] easily.
[00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:31.070] That
[00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:31.230] means
[00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.430] that
[00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.650] the
[00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:31.950] sum
[00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:32.190] is
[00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:32.530] now
[00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:32.750] at
[00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.930] least
[00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:33.270] one
[00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.470] and
[00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.570] we
[00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:33.710] can
[00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:34.130] safely
[00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.510] pass
[00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.730] that
[00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:35.010] sum
[00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:35.190] to
[00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.330] the
[00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:35.710] logarithm.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.260] So
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:38.900] someone
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:39.000] is
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:39.180] asking
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:39.340] if
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:39.500] there's
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:39.640] any
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:39.920] book
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.080] or

[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:44.840] There
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.180] are
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:45.780] definitely

[00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:49.910] A

[00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:50.250] of
[00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:50.590] them
[00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:51.190] don't
[00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.490] really
[00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:51.990] focus
[00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.850] specifically
[00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:53.030] on
[00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.130] the

[00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.750] up

[00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:56.370] And
[00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:57.510] I
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.240] don't
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:58.440] actually
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:58.620] know
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:58.720] of

[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:00.500] I
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:00.700] will
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:01.200] probably
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:01.900] write
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:02.020] an

[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:02.520] about
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:02.660] it
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:02.940] or
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.280] add
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:03.380] it
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:03.480] to

[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:05.800] But
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.300] I
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:06.480] don't
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:06.620] have
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:06.720] a

[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:12.840] The

[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.180] We
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:15.320] use
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:15.420] it
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:15.540] as

[00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:30.630] you
[00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.790] should
[00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:31.010] use
[00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.130] your

[00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:35.730] up
[00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:36.150] and
[00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.410] get

[00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.730] it
[00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.990] is
[00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.110] you

[00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:45.670] off
[00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.930] the

[00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:50.170] this

[00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.550] is

[00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.730] is,
[00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:58.450] but
[00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:58.830] it's
[00:48:58.830 --> 00:48:59.090] basically
[00:48:59.090 --> 00:48:59.330] the
[00:48:59.330 --> 00:48:59.530] same
[00:48:59.530 --> 00:48:59.830] logic
[00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:00.170] as
[00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.270] what
[00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.370] we
[00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:00.510] just
[00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:00.690] saw
[00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:00.810] with
[00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:01.010] log
[00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:01.170]-sum
[00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:01.430] exp.
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:03.060] The
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:03.420] sigmoid
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:03.660] function
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:03.840] is
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.040] also
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:04.260] very
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:04.600] common
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:04.960] in
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.180] deep
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:05.400] learning
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.320] and
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:06.580] it's
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:06.940] essentially
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:07.140] the
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:07.400] same
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:07.640] thing
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:07.800] as
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:08.340] softmax.
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:09.280] It's
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:09.740] basically
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:10.340] a
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:10.920] softmax
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:11.220] where
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:11.420] one
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:11.500] of
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:11.600] the
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:11.880] inputs
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.080] is
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:12.320] hard
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:12.520]-coded
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:12.740] to
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:13.000] zero
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:13.740] and
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:13.900] you
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:14.180] pass
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:14.600] out
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:14.940] just
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.200] one
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:15.300] of
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:15.420] the
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:15.840] outputs.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:17.040] So
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:17.200] once
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:17.480] again
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:17.840] the
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.160] recommendation
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:18.500] is
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:18.620] to
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:18.760] use
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:18.880] your

[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.040] sigmoid
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:20.400] function.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.280] If
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:21.420] you
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:21.760] don't
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:21.960] you
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.240] can
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:22.540] you
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:22.720] can
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.040] stabilize
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:23.280] it
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:23.480] using
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:23.660] the
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:23.860] same
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:24.120] trick
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:24.340] as

[00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.650] The

[00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.650] function

[00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:33.210] especially
[00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:33.410] if
[00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:33.490] you
[00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:33.630] have

[00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:37.690] with
[00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:38.250] sigmoid,
[00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:38.450] just
[00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.790] replace

[00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.710] like
[00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.830] when
[00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:19.930] you
[00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:20.090] take
[00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:20.250] a

[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:22.280] but
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:22.380] it
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:22.500] will
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:22.700] also
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:22.860] mean
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:22.980] that
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:23.060] you

[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:24.580] when

[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:24.840] try
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:24.960] to

[00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:26.810] So
[00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:26.950] that's
[00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:27.030] a
[00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.170] really
[00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:27.490] common
[00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:27.810] bug,
[00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:28.570] and
[00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:28.790] it's
[00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.970] pretty
[00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:29.230] easy
[00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.390] to

[00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:33.910] I've
[00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:34.110] actually
[00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:34.330] seen
[00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:34.470] this
[00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.590] a

[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:41.540] this
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:41.620] is
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:41.720] one
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:41.800] of
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:41.940] those
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:42.240] cases
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:42.640] where
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.380] it'll
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:43.560] look
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:43.740] like
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:43.860] you
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.020] don't
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:44.160] have

[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:44.500] bug
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:44.740] because
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:44.880] if
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:44.980] you
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:45.140] use
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:45.260] a

[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:47.440] will
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:47.800] basically
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.200] work,
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:49.380] but
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:49.480] it
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:49.620] just
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:49.800] won't
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.220] perform
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:50.500] quite
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:50.660] as
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:50.840] well
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:50.960] as
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.060] it
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:51.220] ought
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:51.440] to,
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.080] and
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:52.200] if
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:52.300] you
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:52.480] use
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:52.600] a

[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:53.500] rate
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.340] then
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:54.740] it'll
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:55.040] break,
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:55.180] and
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:55.260] it
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:55.360] will
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:55.540] look
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:55.700] like

[00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.300] really
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:52:59.500] the
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:52:59.760] problem
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:52:59.940] is

[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:10.360] just
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:10.540] if
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:10.640] you

[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:19.820] if
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:19.920] you're
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.080] doing
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:20.220] a
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:20.500] divide
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:20.720] by
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.060] zero,
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:21.340] a
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:21.540] square
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:21.700] root
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:21.820] of
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:21.920] a
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:22.120] negative
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:22.500] number,
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:22.720] an
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:22.940] x
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:23.080] of
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:23.220] a
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:23.440] large
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:23.700] number,
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:23.860] and
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:24.000] so
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:24.260] on.
[00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:25.150] Also
[00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:25.330] you
[00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:25.510] should
[00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.890] always
[00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:26.330] suspect
[00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:26.670] the
[00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.950] code
[00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:27.110] that
[00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:27.250] has
[00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:27.650] changed
[00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.850] the
[00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:28.090] most
[00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:28.590] recently.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:29.520] So
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:29.880] for
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.220] example
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:30.500] if
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:30.800] you
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.080] were
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:31.320] running
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:31.500] your
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:31.700] code
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:31.820] and
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:32.220] everything's
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:32.500] fine
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:32.680] and
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:32.940] then
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.740] eventually
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:34.240] you
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:34.540] add
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:34.920] something
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.340] like
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:35.660] batch
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:35.920] norm
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.560] and
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:36.860] suddenly
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:37.020] you
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:37.120] see
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:37.600] explosion,
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:38.540] then
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:38.820] you
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:38.980] should
[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:39.380] probably
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:39.760] suspect
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.120] that
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:40.300] maybe
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:40.480] the
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:40.780] problem
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:41.540] is
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:41.700] when
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:41.820] you
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:42.200] divide
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:42.400] by
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:42.600] the
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:42.840] square
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.180] root
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:43.480] of
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:43.600] the
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:43.980] variance
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:44.200] in
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:44.320] your
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:44.580] batch
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:44.820] norm,
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:45.520] and
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:45.880] that's
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.040] very
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:46.280] likely
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:46.440] to
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:46.540] be
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:46.680] where
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:46.820] the
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:47.060] problem
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:47.380] is.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:49.300] A
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:49.400] lot
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:49.480] of
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:49.560] the
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:49.680] time
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:49.960] I
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.260] find
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:50.400] that
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:50.540] when
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:50.720] I'm
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:50.980] helping
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:51.420] people
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:51.920] like
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.680] interns
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:52.860] or
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.060] brain
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:53.440] residents,
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:54.360] just
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:54.740] following
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.000] this
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.280] bug
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:55.580] hunting
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.020] strategy
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.440] with
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:56.680] my
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:56.920] colleagues
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.080] at
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:57.260] Google
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:57.580] Brain
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:58.260] will
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:58.740] help
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.060] me
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:53:59.480] almost
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:53:59.900] immediately
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:00.260] solve
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:00.660] problems
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:00.900] that
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:01.080] were
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:01.720] very
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.100] mysterious
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:02.460] for
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:02.660] someone
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:02.820] who
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:02.980] is
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:03.120] new
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.220] to
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:03.420] deep
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:03.680] learning,
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:04.460] and
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:04.760] if
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:04.840] you
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:04.960] can
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.100] learn
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:05.300] this
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:05.540] pattern
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:05.700] it
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:05.920] can
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:06.380] accelerate
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:06.580] your
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:06.820] workflow
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:07.100] quite
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:07.220] a
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:07.400] lot.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:08.100] Okay
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:08.340] thanks,
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:08.580] glad
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:08.680] you
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:08.860] enjoyed
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:09.020] the
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:09.220] talk.
