[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.940] Last
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.280] class,
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.380] I
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.580] talked
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.900] about
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.280] payment
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.660] channels

[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.400] Network.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.140] So
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.420] today,
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.100] we'll
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.280] talk
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.880] a
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.040] bit
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.220] more
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.380] about
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.640] payment
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.980] channels.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.740] We'll
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.040] recap
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.240] a
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.360] little
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.540] bit.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.740] We'll
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.920] talk
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.120] about
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.500] some
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.340] optimizations,
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.780] one
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.880] of
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.040] which
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.280] is
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.780] key
[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.160] addition.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.220] The
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.360] other
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.540] is
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.780] hash
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.100] trees.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.180] And
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.380] then
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.520] we'll
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.720] talk
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.980] about
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.520] cross
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.760]-chain
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.320] swaps
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.520] or
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.840] cross
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.040]-chain
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.460] atomic
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.860] swaps.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.280] So
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.320] last
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.560] time,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.440] the
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.340] main
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.880] idea
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.480] of
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.740] these
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.000] payment
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.340] channels
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.600] is
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.760] you've
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.880] got
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.080] this
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.360] commitment
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.040] transaction.
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.740] And
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.920] each
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.180] party
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.620] holds
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.160] a
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.380] different
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.160] transaction
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.500] that
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.180] has
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.700] the
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.880] same
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.420] amounts,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.320] but
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.740] slightly
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.120] different
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.600] scripts.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.940] So
[00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.950] it's
[00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.310] spending
[00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.750] from
[00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.130] a
[00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.510] shared
[00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.410] funding
[00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.030] transaction.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.320] And
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.640] it's
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.880] sending
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.180] out
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.520] to
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.220] the
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.400] one
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.620] that's
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.760] held
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.960] by
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.180] Alice
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.380] on
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.540] her
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.700] hard
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.000] drive,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.840] sends
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.060] to
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.460] Bob
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.960] in
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.060] the
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.280] clear.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.920] Bob
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.140] just
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.360] gets
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.520] his
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.700] eight
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.020] coins
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.700] with
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.040] no
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.360] ifs,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.580] ands,
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.660] or
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.960] buts.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.780] However,
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.040] when
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.340] Alice
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.980] broadcasts
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.160] this,
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.900] she
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.360] needs
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.880] to
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.600] wait
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.060] 100
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.420] blocks.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.720] She
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.880] needs
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.000] to
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.140] wait
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.260] a
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.440] day.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.720] And
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.000] if
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.220] she
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.700] reveals
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.400] this
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.840] key
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.100] to
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.420] Bob,
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.680] now
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.020] Bob
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.220] can
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.460] use
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.820] Bob's
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.000] key
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.380] and
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.600] this
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.060] revocable
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.360] key.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.340] And
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.900] Bob
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.040] can
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.200] get
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.400] these
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.600] coins
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.040] immediately.
[00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.670] And
[00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.430] the
[00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.710] opposite
[00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.450] is
[00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.350] for
[00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.670] Bob.
[00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.190] So
[00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.430] when
[00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.850] Bob
[00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.090] has
[00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.310] his
[00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.830] transaction,
[00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.590] it's
[00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.750] got
[00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.110] Alice's
[00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.430] signature.
[00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.870] He
[00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.110] doesn't
[00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.330] store
[00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.490] his
[00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.670] own
[00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.830] because
[00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.950] he
[00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.050] can
[00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.210] just
[00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.670] compute
[00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.890] it
[00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.170] quickly.
[00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.830] The
[00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.230] two
[00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.490] coins
[00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.610] that
[00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.710] go
[00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.810] to
[00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.070] Alice
[00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.270] go
[00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.390] to
[00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.570] her
[00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.750] in
[00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.850] the
[00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.050] clear.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.460] However,
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.640] the
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.820] eight
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.080] coins
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.300] that
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.620] Bob
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.200] gets
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.420] for
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.900] himself,
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.860] he
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.000] has
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.120] to
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.220] wait
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.460] 100
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.840] blocks.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.420] And
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.660] during
[00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.190] the
[00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.450] 100
[00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.930] blocks,
[00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.590] Alice
[00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.810] can
[00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.190] sign
[00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.850] if
[00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.330] she
[00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.810] has
[00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.390] Bob's
[00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.110] revocation
[00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.390] key.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.040] So
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.420] that's
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.320] the
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.640] basic
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.920] idea
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.080] of
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.240] these
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.640] outputs.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.440] And
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.580] then
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.720] you
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.180] construct
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.580] these.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.920] So
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.220] when
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.360] I
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.660] say
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.400] Alice
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.660] one
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.960] bitcoin,
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.240] Bob
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.480] nine
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.780] bitcoin,
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.460] it's
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.640] of
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.820] the
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.320] format
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.160] in
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.500] these.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.420] The
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.800] person
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.280] who
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.740] holds
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.940] that
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.460] transaction
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.140] has
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.260] a
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.600] transaction
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.880] where
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.060] the
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.280] other
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.560] party
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.820] gets
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.980] the
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.200] coins
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.620] immediately.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.380] And
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.680] their
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.900] own
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.200] coins
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.480] have
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.760] this
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.520] lock
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.660]-up
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.000] period
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.040] and
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.400] can
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.620] be
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.860] grabbed
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.060] by
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.220] the
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.380] other
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.660] party
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.020] if
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.180] they
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.560] revoke
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.800] them.
[00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.170] So
[00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.550] initially,
[00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.750] the
[00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.990] state
[00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.310] is
[00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.610] Alice
[00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.770] has
[00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.930] one
[00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.150] bitcoin,
[00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.530] Bob
[00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.730] has
[00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.010] nine.
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.140] There's
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.300] two
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.600] different
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.960] state
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.120] one
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.580] transactions,
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.840] one
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.020] held
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.200] by
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.400] Alice,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.540] one
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.700] held
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.840] by
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.040] Bob.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.360] They
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.920] build
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.720] a
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.940] new
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.520] transaction
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.000] together
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.000] where
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.240] Alice
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.420] has
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.640] five
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.860] coins
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.020] and
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.200] Bob
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.400] has
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.980] five
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.260] coins.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.140] And
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.280] then
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.480] they
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.020] revoke
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.700] the
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.900] old
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.180] one
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.660] by
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.240] sharing
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.860] these
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.900] secrets.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.800] So
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.200] now,
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.640] since
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.780] they
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.100] both
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.960] handed
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.220] each
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.420] other
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.740] these
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.540] revocation
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.360] private
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.660] keys,
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.820] both
[00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.350] of
[00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.490] these
[00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.770] parties
[00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.070] cannot
[00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.630] broadcast
[00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.910] this.
[00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.210] If
[00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.350] they
[00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.630] do,
[00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.130] the
[00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.270] other
[00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.510] party
[00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.750] takes
[00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.870] all
[00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.970] the
[00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.150] money.
[00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.250] And
[00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.350] then
[00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.450] you
[00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.570] can
[00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.750] build
[00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.030] these
[00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.590] indefinitely.
[00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.830] So
[00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.010] any
[00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.450] questions
[00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.530] about
[00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.910] that?
[00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.170] That
[00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.310] was
[00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.590] covered
[00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.050] last
[00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.270] time,
[00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.430] but
[00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.570] it
[00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.810] can
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.300] be
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.020] complicated.
[00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.770] Questions?
[00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.070] Good.
[00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.390] So
[00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.050] some
[00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.750] optimizations
[00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.050] we'd
[00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.170] want
[00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.270] to
[00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.530] make.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.880] Yeah.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.080] So
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.480] basically,
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.820] either
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.040] party
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.720] broadcasts
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.920] and
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.080] has
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.200] to
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.380] wait.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.100] Alice
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.340] gives
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.620] Bob
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.820] the
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.200] AliceR
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.480] private
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.660] key.
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.920] Bob
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.120] gives
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.320] Alice
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.500] the
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.860] BobR
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.220] private
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.460] key.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.040] They
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.460] broadcast.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.700] The
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.140] counterparty
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.300] takes
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.440] all
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.540] the
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.760] funds.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.780] So
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.880] what
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.940] are
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.080] some
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.580] optimizations
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.840] here?
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.500] The
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.820] basic
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.100] idea
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.240] of
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.360] the
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.580] script
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.820] is,
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.060] OK,
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.080] you
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.900] can
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.020] have
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.120] a
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.320] signature
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.620] from
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.780] key
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.980] A,
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.740] and
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.820] you
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.920] have
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.020] to
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.180] wait
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.320] a
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.540] day
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.880] or
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.300] two
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.480] or
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.760] five
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.920] or
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.180] whatever.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.280] Or
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.540] you
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.740] can
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.180] have
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.460] a
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.700] signature
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.060] from
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.260] key
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.520] B
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.960] and
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.100] a
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.320] signature
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.620] from
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.780] key
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.040] C.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.880] So
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.120] what
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.160] are
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.300] some
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.820] optimizations
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.080] here?
[00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.700] The
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.360] revealing
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.800] part.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.660] Any
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.800] way
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.900] to
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.080] make
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.280] that
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.920] smaller,
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.300] more
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.620] efficient?
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.540] So
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.680] one
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.940] idea
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.400] is
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.300] use
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.440] a
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.760] preimage
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.300] instead
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.400] of
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.500] a
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.800] signature.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.940] You're
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.060] just
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.500] revealing
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.920] something.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.120] You're
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.280] not
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.620] actually
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.040] committing
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.280] to
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.500] any
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.860] data.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.500] So
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.620] when
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.900] Bob
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.320] reveals
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.580] his
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.860] secret,
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.040] he
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.160] could
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.300] just
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.440] be,
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.720] here's
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.160] a
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.500] preimage.
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.100] And
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.160] you
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.280] can
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.460] get,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.880] instead
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.020] of
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.160] like
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.520] 70
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.740] bytes
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.920] for
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.060] a
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.340] signature,
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.900] you
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.020] get
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.180] down
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.260] to
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.400] like
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.660] 20
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.980] bytes
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.500] for
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.660] a
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.860] hash
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.960] and
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.060] a
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.440] preimage.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.040] Because,
[00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.790] so
[00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.930] how
[00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.070] would
[00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.170] it
[00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.390] work?
[00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.890] You
[00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.070] just
[00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.290] say,
[00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.590] OK,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.160] Alice
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.680] signs
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.100] if
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.520] Alice
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.920] knows
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.800] BobR's
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.300] preimage.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.240] The
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.720] BobR,
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.300] BobR
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.520] doesn't
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.680] have
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.760] to
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.980] actually
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.280] sign.
[00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.650] She
[00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.790] can
[00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.950] just
[00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:40.130] know
[00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.290] it.
[00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.310] That
[00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.450] would
[00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.690] work.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.000] So
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.200] actually,
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.360] that
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.520] was
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.780] sort
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.900] of
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.260] the
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.780] initial
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.240] idea.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.440] I
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.560] think
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.740] that's
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.980] what's
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.220] written
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.440] in
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.560] the
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.840] paper.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.880] But
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.940] you
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.020] can
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.120] do
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.260] even
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.520] smaller.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.400] So
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.700] an
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.840] even
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.060] smaller
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.220] way
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.340] to
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.440] do
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.620] it
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.080] is
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.140] combine
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.720] keys.
[00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.590] So
[00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.070] in
[00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.630] the
[00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.930] elliptic
[00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.190] curve
[00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.630] that
[00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.750] we're
[00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.030] using,
[00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.370] all
[00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.750] these
[00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.010] groups,
[00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.330] all
[00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.450] these
[00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.690] signature
[00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.970] schemes,
[00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.890] if
[00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.010] you
[00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.190] add
[00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.370] two
[00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.570] keys
[00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.930] together,
[00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.450] you
[00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.550] can
[00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.690] get
[00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.790] a
[00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.970] third
[00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.210] key.
[00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.830] And
[00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.370] it's
[00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.750] using
[00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.910] the
[00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.150] addition
[00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.630] operation
[00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.490] that's
[00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.830] defined
[00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.010] on
[00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.210] this
[00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.510] group.
[00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.970] So
[00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:10.070] in
[00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.170] the
[00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.390] case
[00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.650] where
[00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.770] you
[00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.030] have
[00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.290] key
[00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.550] B
[00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.970] and
[00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:13.210] key
[00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.470] C,
[00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.650] and
[00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.730] you
[00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.890] add
[00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.010] them
[00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.310] together
[00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.450] to
[00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.610] get,
[00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.750] say,
[00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.950] key
[00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:15.230] R,
[00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.890] what's
[00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:16.030] the
[00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.310] private
[00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.550] key
[00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.770] for
[00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.950] key
[00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.150] R?
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.980] Anyone?
[00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.690] You've
[00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.930] got
[00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.630] key
[00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.910] B,
[00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.570] private
[00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.830] key.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.280] Key
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.680] C,
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.640] which
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.780] has
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.880] a
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.060] private
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.260] key.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.520] You
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.640] add
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.740] the
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.860] two
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.140] public
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.340] keys
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.480] up
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.780] together.
[00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.370] Yeah,
[00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.690] it's
[00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.770] the
[00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.870] sum
[00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.950] of
[00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.050] the
[00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.230] private
[00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.470] keys.
[00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.150] So
[00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.630] public
[00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.790] key
[00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.990] B
[00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.290] is
[00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.490] just
[00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.930] private
[00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.150] key
[00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.350] B
[00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.590] times
[00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.750] the
[00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.050] generator
[00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.490] point,
[00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.830] G.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.160] And
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.360] then
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.600] this
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.960] is
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.580] C
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.900] times
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.160] G
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.760] equals
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.000] R
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.220] times
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.420] G.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.700] And
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.840] then
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.980] you
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.100] can
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.380] just
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.760] move
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.920] the
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.180] parentheses
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.600] around.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.340] So
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.820] B
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.120] plus
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.320] C,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.520] the
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.820] private
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.220] keys
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.660] added
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.140] together
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.660] times
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.780] the
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.020] generator
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.400] point,
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.920] is
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.120] still
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.300] the
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.480] same.
[00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.970] So
[00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:58.130] this
[00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.230] is
[00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.330] a
[00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.450] really
[00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.670] nice
[00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.010] property.
[00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.930] Actually,
[00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.170] it's
[00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.290] sort
[00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.410] of
[00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.550] the
[00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.750] main
[00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.090] property
[00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.370] that
[00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.890] we
[00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.130] use
[00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.290] for
[00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.590] all
[00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.090] signatures
[00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.490] and
[00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.610] all
[00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.710] this
[00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.950] stuff.
[00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.590] But
[00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.410] what
[00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.590] that
[00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.850] means
[00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:06.130] is
[00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.270] you
[00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.410] can
[00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.710] say,
[00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.010] here,
[00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.850] I
[00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.110] take
[00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.290] your
[00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.590] public
[00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.810] key.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.920] I'm
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.000] going
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.080] to
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.940] come
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.080] up
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.220] with
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.360] my
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.520] own
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.760] private
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.940] key,
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.200] compute
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.360] the
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.580] public
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.700] key
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.820] for
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.040] that,
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.800] add
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.960] them
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.360] together,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.620] and
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.780] say,
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.040] hey,
[00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.290] we've
[00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.430] got
[00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.650] this
[00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.850] new
[00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.350] shared
[00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.210] public
[00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.450] key.
[00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.150] And
[00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.590] neither
[00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.770] of
[00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.870] us
[00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.050] can
[00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.310] sign
[00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.510] with
[00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.630] it
[00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.830] yet,
[00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.230] because
[00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.450] we
[00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.690] don't
[00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.910] know
[00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.090] each
[00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.370] other's
[00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.610] private
[00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.890] keys.
[00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.330] But
[00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.450] if
[00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.630] either
[00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.770] of
[00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.930] us
[00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.330] reveals
[00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.530] the
[00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.750] private
[00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.970] key,
[00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.230] then
[00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.470] the
[00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.610] other
[00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.830] party
[00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.990] can
[00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.170] sign
[00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.330] with
[00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.610] it.
[00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.390] So
[00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.610] if
[00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.170] this
[00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.310] is
[00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.810] Bob's
[00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:32.390] and
[00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.570] this
[00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.710] is
[00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.330] Alice's,
[00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:34.010] they
[00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.250] can
[00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.630] both
[00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.330] compute
[00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.190] little
[00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.390] r
[00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.690] times
[00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.970] G
[00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.410] by
[00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.590] doing
[00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.830] this
[00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.270] operation.
[00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.670] They
[00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.850] both
[00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.090] share
[00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.450] public
[00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.650] keys
[00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.830] and
[00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.150] compute
[00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.390] the
[00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.690] shared
[00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.030] public
[00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.310] key.
[00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.970] But
[00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:43.110] they
[00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.350] cannot
[00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.870] sign,
[00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.170] because
[00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.430] neither
[00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.610] of
[00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.730] them
[00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.990] knows
[00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.210] little
[00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.430] r.
[00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.810] And
[00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:49.030] then,
[00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.310] let's
[00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.610] say,
[00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.370] Alice
[00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.630] says,
[00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.930] OK,
[00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.310] Bob,
[00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.950] here's
[00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.510] this
[00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.690] little
[00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.910] C.
[00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.570] Gives
[00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.670] it
[00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.790] to
[00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.930] Bob.
[00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.150] Bob
[00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.330] says,
[00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.570] OK,
[00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.830] now
[00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.970] I
[00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:55.110] know
[00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.310] little
[00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.530] r.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.480] But
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.720] Alice
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.040] doesn't.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.420] So
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.640] this
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.900] is
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.360] a
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.540] really
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.740] nice
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.860] way
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.960] to
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.080] do
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.820] it,
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.940] because
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.100] it
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.260] saves
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.360] a
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.440] lot
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.520] of
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.780] space.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.380] So
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.040] instead,
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.460] the
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.820] script
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.000] is
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.180] now
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.560] just
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.340] key
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.660] D.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.340] Oh,
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:09.480] I
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.600] should
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.680] have
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.800] put
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.960] r.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.240] Key
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.540] D
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.900] or
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.160] key
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.400] A
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:12.560] in
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.800] time.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.180] So
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.620] instead
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.780] of
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.060] having
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.400] this
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.940] key
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.280] and
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:17.560] time
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.880] passes
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.500] or
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:18.880] these
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.080] other
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.300] two
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.560] keys
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.800] both
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.080] signed,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.500] you
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:20.640] just
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.780] have
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:20.940] a
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.220] single
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.440] key
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.600] that
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.760] can
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.960] sign
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.440] immediately
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.420] or
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:25.300] another
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.560] key
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.700] that
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.840] can
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.040] sign
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.280] after
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:26.420] a
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.580] period
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.740] of
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:26.900] time.
[00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:28.450] So
[00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.670] the
[00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.010] actual
[00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.390] script
[00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.750] used
[00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.130] is
[00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.450] this.
[00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.370] You
[00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.610] say
[00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.130] OPIF,
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.220] the
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.380] key
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:34.660] r,
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.200] OPELSE,
[00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.450] delay,
[00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.070] OPCHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY,
[00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.730] OPDROP,
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.620] then
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:40.740] the
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:40.860] key
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.060] A,
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.260] then
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.380] the
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:41.640] ENDIF,
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.800] then
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.880] the
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.320] OPCHECKSIG.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.600] So
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.080] I'll
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.260] walk
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:43.420] through
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.700] this,
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:43.920] because
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.040] it's
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.120] a
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.200] little
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.520] confusing.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.060] The
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.500] OPIF
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.120] takes
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.460] an
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:47.660] item
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:47.880] off
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.040] the
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.340] stack,
[00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:49.210] and
[00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:49.350] it's
[00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.510] either
[00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.770] true
[00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:49.930] or
[00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:50.190] false.
[00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:50.930] So
[00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:51.110] the
[00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.290] first
[00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.430] thing
[00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.510] you
[00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.590] have
[00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:51.650] to
[00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.750] do
[00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:51.850] is
[00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:51.930] you
[00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:52.030] have
[00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.150] to
[00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.650] indicate
[00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.450] which
[00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.730] of
[00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:53.890] these
[00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.090] two
[00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.430] paths
[00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.630] you're
[00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:54.710] going
[00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.790] to
[00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.090] use.
[00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:56.470] Either
[00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:56.810] you're
[00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:56.870] going
[00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:57.370] to
[00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:57.610] put
[00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:57.850] key
[00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.050] r
[00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.230] on
[00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.350] the
[00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.670] stack,
[00:07:59.490 --> 00:07:59.970] or
[00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:00.450] you're
[00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:00.690] going
[00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.050] to
[00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.570] put
[00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:01.750] this
[00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:01.990] delay
[00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.310] number,
[00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:02.630] which
[00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:02.750] is,
[00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.890] say,
[00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.150] 100
[00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.530] blocks,
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:04.520] put
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:04.640] an
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.780] OPCHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:05.920] to
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.300] verify
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.620] that
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:06.860] it
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.060] has
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.300] been
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:07.560] 100
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:07.820] blocks
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.080] since
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.320] you
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.940] created
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.200] the
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.580] transaction
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:09.780] you're
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.020] spending.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.440] And
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:11.540] then
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:11.620] you
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:11.720] have
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:11.840] to
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.220] drop
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:12.580] the
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:12.860] delay.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.500] This
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:13.660] was
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:13.820] to
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.080] ensure
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.640] compatibility,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.080] since
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.260] it's
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.320] a
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:15.540] software.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:16.700] So
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:16.980] old
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.240] nodes
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.420] would
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:17.660] see
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:17.980] this.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:18.560] Old
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:18.760] nodes
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.160] would
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.340] see
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.660] this.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.120] They
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.240] would
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.400] see
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:20.540] a
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:20.960] NOOP,
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:21.600] and
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:21.740] then
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:21.840] they
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:21.960] would
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.100] see
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.240] the
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.580] drop
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:22.860] to
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.020] get
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.220] rid
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:23.320] of
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:23.500] this
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.020] whole
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.460] thing.
[00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.650] So
[00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:25.830] the
[00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.010] old
[00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.210] nodes
[00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.410] wouldn't
[00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:26.570] see
[00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.650] it
[00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:26.770] at
[00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:26.870] all.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.200] Then
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.640] you
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:28.780] have
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:28.900] a
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.020] key
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.220] a
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:29.620] put
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:29.760] on
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:29.880] the
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.120] stack,
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:30.800] and
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:30.900] then
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.000] you
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.160] end
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.280] the
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.420] if
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:31.720] statement,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.160] and
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.300] then
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.420] you
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:32.620] check
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:32.980] signatures.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:33.600] So
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:33.840] really,
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.040] the
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.200] if
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.480] statement
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:34.840] is
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.060] just
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:35.440] determining
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.020] which
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.000] key
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.840] gets
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.120] pushed
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.380] onto
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:38.580] the
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:38.880] stack.
[00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:41.490] And
[00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:41.630] then
[00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.330] after
[00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:42.550] the
[00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.670] if
[00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.990] statement,
[00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:43.330] there's
[00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:43.430] a
[00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.850] checksig
[00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:44.690] to
[00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.910] check

[00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:45.910] key.
[00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:46.730] So
[00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.950] for
[00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:47.210] example,
[00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:47.510] if
[00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:47.890] you're
[00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.650] using

[00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:50.610] key,
[00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.930] the

[00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.370] that
[00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:51.570] has
[00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:51.750] been

[00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.250] you,
[00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:53.730] you
[00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:53.870] just
[00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.070] put
[00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.210] a

[00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.590] on
[00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.690] the
[00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:54.990] stack
[00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.430] and
[00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.570] then
[00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:55.710] a
[00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.990] signature
[00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.570] from
[00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.830] r.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.820] And
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.160] then
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.300] the
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:58.660] opif
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.340] resolves
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:08:59.460] to
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:08:59.680] true,
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:08:59.920] so
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.080] it
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.540] executes
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:00.800] this
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.020] by
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.240] just
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.560] pushing
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.100] the
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.220] key
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:02.400] onto
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.540] the
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:02.780] stack.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:03.600] Then
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:03.800] it
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.220] executes
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:04.420] op
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:04.680] else,
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.480] skips
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:05.820] to
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.020] op
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.220] end
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:06.440] if,
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.340] and
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:07.460] then
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:07.640] does
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:07.840] op
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.200] checksig.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.100] So
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.500] basically,
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:09.940] you
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.080] say
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.420] 1,
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.020] execute
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:11.240] op
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:11.440] if,
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.140] key
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.420] r,
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.220] skip

[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.740] checksig.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:14.740] So
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:14.940] it's
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.120] just
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.380] you
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:15.540] need
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:15.680] to
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:15.880] sign
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.060] with
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:16.240] this
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:16.420] key.
[00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.090] Or
[00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.190] you
[00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.370] say
[00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:18.790] 0
[00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.230] and

[00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.810] from
[00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:19.950] a.
[00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.770] And
[00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:20.930] then
[00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:21.230] so
[00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.470] the
[00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.670] op
[00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.850] if
[00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:22.110] takes
[00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.230] a
[00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.510] 0.
[00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:22.890] It
[00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:23.570] skips
[00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.170] to
[00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.630] op
[00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.930] else,
[00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.150] because
[00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.410] it's
[00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.030] not
[00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.950] true.
[00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.030] It
[00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.450] pushes
[00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:30.790] delay
[00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.030] onto
[00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.070] the

[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:35.980] that
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:36.220] enough
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:36.520] time
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:36.660] has
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.020] passed,
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.820] drops
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.140] the

[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:39.780] number
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.060] off

[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:40.620] which
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:40.720] is
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:40.820] a
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:40.900] little
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.180] ugly.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:41.420] It
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:41.480] would
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:41.580] be
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:41.860] nicer
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.080] if
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.320] op
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:42.760] checksequence
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.020] verify
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.280] did
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:43.460] that
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:43.860] itself,
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:44.840] but
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:44.960] it
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.300] doesn't.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:47.960] Then
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.520] pushes
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:48.760] key
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:48.880] a
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.080] onto
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.240] the
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:49.540] stack,
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:51.700] ends
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:51.860] the
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:51.980] if
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.260] statement,
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:52.520] and
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:52.700] checks
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:52.840] the
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.060] signature.
[00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.890] So
[00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:54.730] it's
[00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.190] a
[00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.330] little
[00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:55.670] more
[00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.170] complicated
[00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:56.470] than
[00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.890] in
[00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:57.350] C,
[00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:57.610] where
[00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:57.730] you
[00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:57.910] just
[00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.070] can
[00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.330] say
[00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.410] key
[00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.910] d
[00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.290] or
[00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.570] key
[00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:00.790] a
[00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.990] and
[00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.270] time.
[00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:02.050] But
[00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.450] this
[00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:03.550] is
[00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.790] stack
[00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.990]-based,
[00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.190] and
[00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.690] it's
[00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:04.830] not
[00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:05.090] too
[00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.330] hard
[00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:05.530] when
[00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:05.690] you
[00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.810] get
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:07.340] these
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:07.520] things
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:07.600] to
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:07.760] work.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:08.360] So
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:08.500] any
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:08.780] questions
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.200] about
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.080] this
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.360] setup?
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:12.840] Yes?
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:13.600] So
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:13.900] what's
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.200] op
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:14.520] drop?
[00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:15.870] Op
[00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.070] drop
[00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.470] takes
[00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.830] the
[00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.270] topmost
[00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:17.490] item
[00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:17.630] on
[00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.730] the
[00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:17.950] stack
[00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.070] and
[00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:18.330] deletes
[00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:18.590] it,
[00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.210] and
[00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:19.310] all
[00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.590] the
[00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:20.210] lower
[00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.610] items
[00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:21.130] come
[00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:21.310] back
[00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.490] up.
[00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:24.310] Yeah,
[00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.790] it's
[00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.090] just
[00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:25.330] so

[00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:26.750]-wise,

[00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:32.590] basically,
[00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.830] this
[00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:33.010] used

[00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.390] And
[00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:35.590] then

[00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.090] you're

[00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:51.530] in

[00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:53.890] Old
[00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:54.150] nodes
[00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.330] would
[00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:54.470] just
[00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.610] see

[00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.790] And
[00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.930] so
[00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:56.130] you
[00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:56.270] could
[00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:56.530] put
[00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:56.850] something

[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:00.920] and
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.060] then
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.180] an

[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.320] And
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:07.440] if
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:07.660] this
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.340] consumed

[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:12.600] nodes
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:12.860] might
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.100] say,
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.260] oh,
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:13.460] this
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:13.580] is
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:13.900] invalid.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.320] Even
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:14.580] though
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:14.820] this
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:14.920] is
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.040] a

[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.300] the

[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.300] code
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.080] causes
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.260] this
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:20.420] to
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:20.640] fail.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.440] Whereas
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.020] in
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.180] the
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:22.320] new

[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:22.960] it
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.100] would
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.260] be
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:23.400] like,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:23.520] no,
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:23.680] this
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:23.780] is
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:23.920] good,
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.160] because
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.380] this
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:24.780] consumes
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.060] that
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:25.580] value.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:26.720] And
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.000] that
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.200] would
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.520] actually
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:27.780] make
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:27.860] it
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:27.940] a
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.100] hard
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:28.360] fork,
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.020] because
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.200] then
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:29.340] there
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:29.440] would
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:29.580] be
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.020] transactions
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.340] where
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:30.500] the
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:30.780] old
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.200] nodes
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.960] thought
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.140] it
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:32.260] was
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:32.420] not
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:32.680] good,
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.220] and
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:33.340] the
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:33.500] new
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:33.800] nodes
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.060] thought,
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:34.320] yes,
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:34.520] this
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:34.620] is
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:34.860] OK.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.100] So
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.300] to
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:36.720] ensure
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.140] that
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.720] this
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.440] only
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.700] restricts
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:40.900] the
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.780] validity
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.040] of
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:42.440] scripts,
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.540] it
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.060] doesn't
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:44.700] pop
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:44.880] that
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.040] off.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.140] So
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:45.180] you
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:45.280] have
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.420] to
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.000] manually
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.340] drop
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:46.520] it.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.160] And
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:47.400] drop
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:47.580] is
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:47.960] there
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.140] from
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:48.420] before.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:48.720] So
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.660] to
[00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:49.850] an
[00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.410] old
[00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:50.670] node,
[00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.790] it
[00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.870] would
[00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:51.010] just
[00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.170] say,
[00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:51.630] delay,
[00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:52.090] no
[00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:52.310] op,
[00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:52.650] drop.
[00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:52.830] And
[00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:52.950] it's
[00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:53.070] like,
[00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.310] OK,
[00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:53.470] you
[00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.630] put
[00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.870] something
[00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.990] in
[00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.070] the
[00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.290] stack,
[00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:54.430] you
[00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.570] do
[00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:54.830] nothing,
[00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.990] and
[00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.090] then
[00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:55.190] you
[00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.350] take
[00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.430] it
[00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.550] off
[00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.670] the
[00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.850] stack.
[00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:56.130] Fine.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.300] So
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.500] that's
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:58.660] just
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.260] a
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:11:59.940] compatibility
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.400] thing.
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.100] If
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:01.200] you
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.320] were
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:01.480] going
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:01.560] to
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:01.720] make
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:01.820] it
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:01.960] from
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.220] scratch,
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:02.420] you'd
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:02.640] probably
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.280] do
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:03.380] it
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:03.600] differently.
[00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.790] Other
[00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.110] questions
[00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.350] about
[00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.770] this?
[00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.790] OK,
[00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.690] cool.
[00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:09.130] So
[00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.690] then
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:13.840] you
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.140] reveal
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:14.520] keys.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:14.800] You
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.120] keep
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.540] revealing
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.080] things
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.060] each
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:17.660] time
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.380] you
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.800] make
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:19.880] a
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.020] new
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.280] state.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.260] And
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:21.440] you
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:21.540] can
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:21.680] do
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.040] these
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.300] several
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:23.580] times
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:23.720] a
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:23.960] second.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:24.620] You
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:24.760] can
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:24.880] do
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:24.980] it
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.140] 10
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.340] times
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:25.460] a
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:25.660] second,
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:25.880] something
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.100] like
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.320] that.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:26.720] So
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:26.800] you
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:26.860] can
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.020] have
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.380] millions,
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:27.940] billions
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:28.200] of
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.480] different
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:28.720] old
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.180] transactions.
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:29.860] The
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.120] problem
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.360] is,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:30.740] you
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:30.920] do
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.160] have
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.300] to
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:31.720] remember
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.180] all
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:32.340] of
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:32.640] these
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.120] old
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.140] private
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.440] keys
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:34.980] that
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.120] your
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.600] counterparty
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:35.700] has
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:35.860] given
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.000] to
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.260] you.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:36.800] Because
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:36.920] if
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.020] you
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:37.260] forget
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.560] one,
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:38.660] they
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:38.880] might
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.440] broadcast
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:39.940] a
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.500] transaction
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.420] where
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:41.680] you
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:41.900] really
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.080] need
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.200] to
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.340] know
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:42.500] that
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:42.780] private
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:42.960] key
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.120] in
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.240] order
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:43.340] to
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:43.560] grab
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:43.700] the
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:43.840] money
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.260] immediately.
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:45.500] So
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:45.700] if
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:45.980] you,
[00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:47.110] for
[00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.810] example,
[00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.130] you
[00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:48.910] forget
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.160] this
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.340] was
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:50.760] revoked,
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.400] but
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:51.520] you
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:51.820] forgot
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.100] about
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.400] it,
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.020] and
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:53.180] you're
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.540] Alice,
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.240] and
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.400] then
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.560] Bob
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.160] broadcasts
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:55.360] this,
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:55.940] you
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.240] really
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:56.440] need
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:56.540] to
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:56.660] know
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:56.820] that
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.080] private
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.240] key
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:57.400] so
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:57.520] you
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:57.640] can
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.040] grab
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.520] Bob's
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:12:59.780] five
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.160] coins
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.800] with
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.040] your
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:01.640] combined
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.000] key.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.160] So
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.240] you
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.340] need
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:03.420] to
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:03.540] keep
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:03.740] track
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:03.860] of
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:03.980] all
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.160] these
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:04.320] old
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:04.540] things.
[00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:06.950] So
[00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:07.390] it's
[00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:07.670] 32
[00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.850] bytes
[00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:08.150] each.
[00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.370] It's
[00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:08.510] not
[00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:08.730] great
[00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:08.950] for
[00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:09.390] scalability.
[00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.550] So
[00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.990] there's
[00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.410] actually
[00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:11.730] a
[00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:11.870] couple
[00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.970] of
[00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:12.090] ways
[00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:12.210] you
[00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:12.310] could
[00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.430] do
[00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:12.610] this.
[00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:12.830] How
[00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:13.070] can
[00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.250] you
[00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.810] remember
[00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.330] a
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.860] chain
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.380] of
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.640] 32
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:17.880]-byte
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.180] secrets?
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:19.400] A
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:19.560] Merkle
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:19.760] tree
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.200] itself
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.000] would
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.280] have
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.520] a
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:21.720] root
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.160] here,
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:22.960] and
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.100] then
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.240] a
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:23.440] bunch
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:23.620] of
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.020] little
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.940] hashes
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.200] that
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.580] go
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:25.800] up
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.060] to
[00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.150] the
[00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.390] tree,
[00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:27.810] the
[00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.310] tree's
[00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.510] root.
[00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.130] So
[00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:30.350] if
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.400] these
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:31.580] were
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:31.960] secrets,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.280] you
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:32.460] can't
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:32.560] go
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:32.740] back
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.040] down,
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.280] right?
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:33.600] So
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:33.720] if
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:33.800] you're
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:33.920] like,
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.140] OK,
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:34.300] I
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:34.460] got
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:34.780] secret
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.120] 0,
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:35.500] secret
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:35.840] 1,
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:36.300] secret
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.440] 2,
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:37.840] secret
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.280] 3,
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:38.920] well,
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.040] I've
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.160] got
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.320] the
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:39.600] parents
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:39.760] of
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:39.880] these
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.040] two
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.340] things,
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:40.500] but
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:40.600] I
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:40.780] can't
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.020] actually
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.820] remember
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.060] them
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.260] anymore.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.220] So
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:43.920] a
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.020] real
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.320] simple
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:45.520] way,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:45.720] say,
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:45.980] OK,
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:46.820] I've
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.080] got,
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:47.560] and
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:47.660] you
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:47.780] can
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.160] construct
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.300] it
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:48.460] however
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:48.660] you
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:48.880] want.
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:49.540] Obviously,
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:49.700] if
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:49.800] your
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.240] counterparty
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:50.300] is
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:50.460] not
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:50.940] cooperating
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.160] and
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.200] these
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.560] secret
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:52.860] numbers
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.080] are
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.240] just
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:53.580] completely
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.000] random,
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:54.680] there's
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:54.840] nothing
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.020] you
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.140] can
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.320] do.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.000] If
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.080] he
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.200] just
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.340] says,
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:56.540] hey,
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:56.720] I'm
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:56.800] going
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:56.860] to
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.040] give
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.240] you
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:57.560] secret
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:57.820] 0,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.200] secret
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.440] 1,
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:58.700] secret
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:58.960] 2,
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:13:59.740] there's
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.160] no
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.520] special
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:01.920] properties
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.160] about
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:02.360] these
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:02.560] things.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:02.680] I
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:02.860] can't
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:02.960] do
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.160] anything.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.380] The
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:04.700] simplest
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.040] way,
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:05.740] what's
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:05.840] a
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.020] real
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:06.280] simple
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:06.520] way
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:06.640] to
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:06.780] say,
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:06.940] OK,
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.100] I'm
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:07.180] going
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:07.280] to
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:07.580] reveal
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.400] secrets
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:08.900] sequentially,
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:09.820] and
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:09.960] then
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.120] you
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.300] can
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:10.700] store
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.200] fewer
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:11.400] of
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.560] them?
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:19.970] It's
[00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:20.170] sort
[00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.270] of
[00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:20.510] like
[00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:20.950] a
[00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:21.270] blockchain,
[00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.890] right?
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.260] So
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:24.800] you
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:24.920] could
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.080] just
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:25.340] say,
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:25.640] OK,
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.100] well,
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:27.300] I
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:27.900] create
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.460] secret
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:28.900] 3.
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.020] Secret
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.400] 2
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:31.720] is
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:31.940] the
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.360] hash
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.220] of
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:33.500] secret
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:33.900] 3.
[00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.450] Secret
[00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:35.890] 1
[00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.270] is
[00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:36.470] the
[00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.850] hash
[00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:37.370] of
[00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.610] secret
[00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.970] 2.
[00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:39.990] And
[00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.190] so
[00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:40.430] now
[00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.610] I
[00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:40.950] reveal
[00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:41.410] 1.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.000] You
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.120] don't
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.260] know
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:43.400] what
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:43.560] 2
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:43.900] is,
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.180] and
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:44.720] so
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:44.940] on.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:45.260] So
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:45.660] 0
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.120] equals
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.460] hash
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:46.660] of
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:46.980] 1.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.120] So
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.200] you
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:48.280] could
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.400] just
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:48.520] have
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:48.660] a
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:48.940] linear
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.060] chain
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:51.320] like
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:51.600] this,
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:51.820] right?
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:51.980] So
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.320] 0,
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:52.900] 1,
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.260] 2,
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:53.680] 3.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.400] If
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:54.520] you
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:54.880] remember
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.200] 3,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:55.440] you
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:55.620] can
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.040] compute
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.700] 2
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:56.800] and
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:56.960] 1
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.080] and
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.280] 0.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:57.940] If
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:58.040] you
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.380] remember
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:58.740] 2,
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:58.980] you
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.120] can
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.420] compute
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:14:59.780] 1
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:14:59.880] and
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.040] 0,
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.200] but
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:00.360] not
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:00.560] 3.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.440] So
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:01.620] you
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:01.720] can
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:01.840] do
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.100] that.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.320] That
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:03.420] would
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:03.640] actually
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:03.900] probably
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.140] work
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:04.440] fine,
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:04.780] but
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:04.980] we
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.300] always
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:05.500] want
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:05.680] to
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.320] make
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:06.900] unnecessary
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.420] complex
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.000] optimizations
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.200] to
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:08.360] things.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:09.960] So
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.460] the
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:10.720] problem
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:10.860] with
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.020] this
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.280] is,
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:11.800] if
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:11.920] you've
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.040] got
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.140] a
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:12.340] billion
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:12.580] of
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:12.760] them
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:13.400] and
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:13.540] you
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:13.740] need
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:13.920] to
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.080] go
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.460] back
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:14.940] to
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:15.560] the
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:15.760] first
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.000] one,
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:16.640] you
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:16.840] need
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.200] to
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.900] compute
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.220] a
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:18.440] billion
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:18.840] hash
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.920] operations.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:20.440] That's
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:20.580] kind
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:20.640] of
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:20.820] slow.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:21.640] So
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.740] what
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:22.840] we
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.180] do,
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:23.440] or
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.080] the
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.400] basic
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:24.700] idea,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.000] there's
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.640] multiple
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.280] implementations,
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:26.520] slight
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:26.920] variations.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:27.900] You
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.000] have
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.140] a
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.480] hash
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:28.840] tree.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:29.320] So
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.500] you
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:29.720] reveal
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.020] secrets
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:30.180] one
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:30.260] at
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:30.340] a
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:30.560] time.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:30.780] You
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:30.980] store
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.220] only
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:31.460] log
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:31.620] n
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:31.980] secrets,
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:32.560] and
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:32.720] you
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.280] recompute
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:33.760] any
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.040] secret
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.220] you
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:34.460] want
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:34.840] with
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.680] something
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.060] around
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.320] log
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:36.580] n
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.660] operations.
[00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.110] I
[00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.330] called
[00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:39.470] it
[00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.830] LCRM.
[00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.170] I
[00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:40.430] think
[00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.070] there's
[00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:41.170] an
[00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:41.430] actual
[00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.770] paper
[00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:42.030] that
[00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.590] basically
[00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.790] is
[00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.970] this
[00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:43.190] called
[00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:43.850] GGM.
[00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:44.590] I
[00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.330] think
[00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:45.570] written
[00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:45.730] by
[00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:45.950] people
[00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:46.070] at
[00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:46.310] MIT.
[00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:48.130] But
[00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:48.250] I
[00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:48.510] called
[00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:48.610] it
[00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:48.870] LCRM
[00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.050] because
[00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:49.210] it's
[00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:49.590] basically
[00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.250] Merkle
[00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:50.410] tree
[00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:50.690] backwards
[00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:51.070] because
[00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:51.250] the
[00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:51.470] arrows
[00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.750] point
[00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:51.890] the
[00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:52.010] other
[00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:52.350] direction.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:54.740] So
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:54.860] in
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:55.040] this
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.320] case,
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.740] you
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.200] start
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.340] with
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:57.460] a
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:57.660] root.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.360] You
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.540] start
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:01.660] with
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:01.840] something
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.060] up
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:02.240] here.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:02.740] And
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:02.820] you
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:02.920] say,
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.080] OK,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.200] if
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:03.320] I
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:03.520] wanted
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:03.720] to
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:03.980] send
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.220] to
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:04.360] the
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:04.640] left,
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.480] I
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:05.920] append
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.080] a
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.340] 0
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:06.800] to
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:06.960] the
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.420] hash
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:08.680] value
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:08.800] of
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:08.940] this
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.100] root,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:09.920] and
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.260] I
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:10.600] hash
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:10.860] to
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.000] get
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.160] down.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:11.660] And
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:11.760] if
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:11.860] I
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.000] want
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.080] to
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:12.220] go
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:12.580] right,
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.100] I
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:13.380] append
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:13.520] a
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:13.720] 1
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:13.860] at
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:13.980] the
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.240] end,
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:14.960] hash
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.260] that,
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:15.660] and
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:15.760] then
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:15.800] I
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:15.880] go
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.060] down
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.220] here.
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.340] So
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:17.780] what
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:17.960] that
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.140] lets
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:18.280] you
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:18.500] do
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:18.920] is
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.440] there's
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:19.560] a
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:19.820] sender
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:19.920] and
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.060] a
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:20.300] receiver.
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:21.540] The
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:21.980] sender
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.340] just
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:22.780] computes
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.040] a
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.220] root
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:23.600] and
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:23.880] stores
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.180] that.
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:24.880] They
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.080] make
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.200] a
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:25.460] random
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:25.820] root
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:25.980] up,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:26.300] store
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:26.500] it.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:27.340] And
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:27.520] then
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:27.640] they
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:27.820] also
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.040] keep
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.280] track
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.420] of,
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:28.580] OK,
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:28.740] how
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:28.940] many
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:29.260] secrets
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:29.400] have
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:29.500] I
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:29.720] given?
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.160] The
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:31.600] receiver
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.060] just
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:32.480] receives
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:32.980] the
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.200] first
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.420] one,
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.100] number
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.420] 0.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.360] Can't
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:35.480] do
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:35.720] anything.
[00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:37.310] They
[00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.610] receive
[00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.970] 1.
[00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.010] OK,
[00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.190] still
[00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:40.410] can't
[00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:40.490] do
[00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.690] anything.
[00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:41.110] They
[00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.430] receive
[00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.850] 2.
[00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:42.610] Now
[00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:42.770] they
[00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:42.910] can
[00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:43.090] say,
[00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:43.290] OK,
[00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.470] well,
[00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:43.610] I
[00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.730] can
[00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.970] throw

[00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.430] 0

[00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:45.410] I
[00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.610] want
[00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:45.730] to

[00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:48.230] And

[00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:48.450] I
[00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:48.630] wanted

[00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.150] I
[00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.250] want
[00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:51.330] to
[00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:51.470] send
[00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.550] to
[00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.730] right.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:53.920] So
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.360] I
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.180] don't
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:55.580] store
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:55.900] these,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.180] but
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:56.340] I
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:56.620] know
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:56.860] they're
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.060] still
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.500] computable
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:57.700] for
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:57.920] me
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.400] if
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:58.480] I
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:58.620] ever
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:58.860] want
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.100] to
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:16:59.980] grab
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:00.100] them
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:00.320] back.
[00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.070] I
[00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:01.330] receive
[00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:01.610] 3,
[00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:02.030] can't
[00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.130] do
[00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:02.410] anything.
[00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:02.890] Receive
[00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:03.210] 4,
[00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.550] can't
[00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.650] do
[00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:04.010] anything.
[00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:07.210] Receive
[00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:07.650] 5.
[00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:08.210] Now
[00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.510] I
[00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.750] can
[00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.270] do
[00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.410] the
[00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:09.570] same
[00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:09.730] thing
[00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:09.870] with
[00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:10.010] 3
[00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.110] and
[00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.350] 4,
[00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:10.770] remove
[00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:11.070] those
[00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:11.330] from
[00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:11.670] the
[00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:11.910] disk,
[00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:13.130] and
[00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.410] only
[00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:13.770] store
[00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.050] 2
[00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:14.190] and
[00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:14.550] 5.
[00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:15.170] So
[00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:15.530] if
[00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.010] I
[00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.130] get
[00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:16.230] a
[00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.490] request
[00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.670] for
[00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:16.870] 3,
[00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:17.050] I
[00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:17.190] can
[00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:17.650] easily
[00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:17.970] compute
[00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:18.110] it.
[00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:18.290] And
[00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:18.410] then
[00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:18.510] I
[00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:18.750] receive
[00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.090] 6,
[00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.350] and
[00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.430] I
[00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:19.530] can
[00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:19.730] delete
[00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.950] those
[00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:20.070] two
[00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:20.190] as
[00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:20.350] well.
[00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.250] So
[00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:21.690] as
[00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:21.810] I
[00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:21.970] go
[00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:22.130] up
[00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.250] the
[00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.510] tree,
[00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:23.810] sometimes
[00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.010] I
[00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:24.130] only
[00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:24.250] have
[00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:24.330] to
[00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:24.470] store
[00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.670] one
[00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:24.930] thing.
[00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.630] Sometimes
[00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.970] I
[00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:26.190] have
[00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:26.370] to
[00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:26.950] store
[00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.190] three
[00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:28.610] things
[00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.130] because
[00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:29.370] that's
[00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:29.510] the
[00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.650] height
[00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:29.770] of
[00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:29.870] the
[00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:30.030] tree.
[00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.350] Well,
[00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.930] it's
[00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:31.210] basically
[00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:31.410] you
[00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:31.570] have
[00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:31.710] to
[00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.970] store
[00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.010] at
[00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:34.010] most
[00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.350] 1
[00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.670] on
[00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:34.930] every
[00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:35.290] level,
[00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.650] and
[00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:35.810] then
[00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:36.150] sometimes
[00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.450] 2
[00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.670] if
[00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:37.790] there
[00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:37.850] are
[00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.990] two
[00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.230] leaves.
[00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:39.170] So
[00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:39.550] basically,
[00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:39.830] log
[00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.950] n
[00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.230] storage.
[00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.050] And
[00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:42.450] computing
[00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:42.850] hashes
[00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:43.010] is
[00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.190] pretty
[00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.390] quick,
[00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.570] too.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.280] So
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:44.720] that's
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:44.820] a
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:44.980] fun
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.240] way
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:45.720] to
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.260] only
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:47.400] have
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:47.520] to
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:47.700] store
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:47.860] a
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:48.080] very
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.700] small
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:48.960] amount
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.060] of
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:49.240] data.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.260] Any
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:50.540] questions
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:50.760] about
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.080] this?
[00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:52.290] OK,
[00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.450] so
[00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:52.610] we're
[00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.910] going
[00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:53.150] quick.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:55.960] OK,
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:56.600] we
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:56.760] need
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.120] intermissions
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:57.400] quick.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.040] OK,
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:58.260] so
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:58.960] we'll
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.100] talk
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.240] about
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:17:59.500] cross
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:17:59.660]-chain
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:17:59.960] swaps
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.280] for
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:00.800] most
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:00.980] of
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.040] the
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.200] bulk
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.360] of
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:01.600] this
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:01.960] day.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:03.920] So
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.320] there
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:04.440] are
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:04.840] altcoins.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:06.760] I
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.140] mostly
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.360] work
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:07.520] on
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:07.740] Bitcoin.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.020] I
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:08.140] think
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:08.260] a
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:08.360] lot
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:08.460] of
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:08.560] the
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:08.800] research
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:08.940] is
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.060] on
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.240] Bitcoin,
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:09.460] but
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:09.680] there's
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:09.780] a
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:09.880] lot
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.040] of
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.440] different
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:10.740] coins,
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:10.940] too.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.300] People
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.080] saw
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.260] the
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:12.460] idea
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:12.600] of
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:12.800] Bitcoin
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.180] and
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:13.360] said,
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:13.520] hey,
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.680] let's
[00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.850] copy
[00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:16.010] it.
[00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.410] So
[00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:16.750] initially,
[00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:17.170] most
[00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:17.290] of
[00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:17.410] them
[00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:17.550] were
[00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:17.710] just
[00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.030] copies.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:20.780] There
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:20.960] was
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.140] a
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:21.420] site
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:21.700] called
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.120] coingen
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.500].io.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:22.840] So
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.900] 2012,
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.040] there
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.280] started
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:25.420] to
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:25.520] be

[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:47.280] people
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.440] who

[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:54.160] to

[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:54.980] TadgeCoin.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:55.540] I

[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:55.780] there
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:55.880] to

[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:57.660] coins
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.100] every
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:58.680] three
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.040] minutes,
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:18:59.320] and
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:18:59.420] I
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:18:59.600] want
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.100] just
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.740] a

[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.080] of
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:01.840] things.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:01.960] You
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.060] could
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:02.300] upload
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:02.460] a
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:02.560] little
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:02.880] picture,
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:03.380] and
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:03.480] it
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:03.580] would
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:03.880] make
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.440] a
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.200] program
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.520] for
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:06.740] you
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.120] based
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.280] on
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:07.440] those
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:07.880] things.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.320] And
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:09.640] then
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:09.740] I
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:09.880] think
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.000] he
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.200] sold
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.360] the
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:10.520] site.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.100] I
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:11.260] think
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:11.360] it
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:11.460] was
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:11.580] like
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:11.700] the
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.000] first
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.840] blockchain
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.400] technology
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.380] companies
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:14.600] by
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:14.780] far.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.720] OK,
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:15.960] so
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.200] then
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:16.960] recent
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.200] ones
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:17.300] are
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:17.440] very
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:17.660] different.
[00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.250] People
[00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.930] trade
[00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:20.450] altcoins
[00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.690] for
[00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:21.090] bitcoins
[00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:21.550] and
[00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:21.790] trade
[00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:22.110] altcoins
[00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.310] for
[00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.670] altcoins,
[00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:23.150] and
[00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.290] they
[00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:23.610] use
[00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.070] exchanges.
[00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:24.850] I
[00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:24.930] don't
[00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:25.050] know
[00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:25.310] if
[00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:26.850] people
[00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:27.210] here
[00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:27.630] used
[00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.150] exchanges
[00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.450] to
[00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:28.670] trade
[00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.170] altcoins.
[00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.390] Some?
[00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.950] OK.
[00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:31.250] I
[00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.510] actually
[00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.810] have.
[00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:32.350] I
[00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.590] hadn't
[00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.950] until
[00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:33.350] last
[00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.490] year.
[00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.250] But
[00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.610] there
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.420] was
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:36.940] these
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:37.540] sort
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:37.640] of
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:37.840] hard
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.180] forks
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:38.520] from
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:38.860] Bitcoin,
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.100] like
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.400] Bitcoin
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:39.740] Cash,
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:39.920] and
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.140] Bitcoin
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.460] Gold,

[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:40.860] Bitcoin
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.100] whatever.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.360] And
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:41.480] so
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:41.620] I
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:41.920] actually
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.840] opened
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:42.980] an
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.140] account
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:43.440] and
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:43.740] sold
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:43.900] them
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:44.000] and
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.140] got
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:44.420] more
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:44.700] bitcoins.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.020] How
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.140] do
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.260] you
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.540] trade?
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:46.800] Well,
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.100] use
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.200] an
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.560] exchange.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:48.840] And
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:48.940] so
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.060] the
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.280] current
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:49.660] exchange

[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:57.980] then
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.200] ask
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:58.300] for
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:58.460] your
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:58.640] coins
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:58.900] back.
[00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.190] So
[00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.630] the
[00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.750] give
[00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.870] us
[00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.990] all
[00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.150] your
[00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.370] coins
[00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:02.670] part,
[00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:03.330] it
[00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:03.490] works
[00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:03.790] fine.
[00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:04.770] They
[00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:04.910] give
[00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:04.990] you
[00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.090] an
[00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.430] address.
[00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:06.270] You
[00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.790] send
[00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.110] your
[00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.430] coins
[00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.590] to
[00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.730] their
[00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:08.050] address,
[00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:08.370] and
[00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.030] it'll
[00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.370] appear
[00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:09.650] on
[00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.790] their
[00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:10.070] site
[00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.030] generally.
[00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.810] But
[00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:12.150] you
[00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:12.430] definitely
[00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.670] can
[00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:12.850] send
[00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:12.990] your
[00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.230] coins.
[00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.410] The
[00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:14.730] ask
[00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:14.850] for
[00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:15.010] your
[00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:15.250] coins
[00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:15.550] back
[00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:15.910] is
[00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:16.110] where
[00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.270] the
[00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.470] model
[00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.730] tends
[00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.890] to
[00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.070] fail.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.140] There's
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:19.620] many,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:19.840] many
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.240] cases
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:20.960] where
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.900] they
[00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.310] don't
[00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.450] give
[00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:22.550] them
[00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:22.850] back.
[00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.610] And
[00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:24.970] there's
[00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:25.130] a
[00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.410] lot
[00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:25.650] of
[00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:25.930] reasons
[00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.210] for
[00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.550] this.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:28.700] So
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.180] Mt.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:29.400] Gox
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:29.540] is
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:29.700] one
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:29.780] of
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:29.880] the
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.880] most
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.280] prominent
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:31.660] early
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.020] ones,
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.240] but
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:32.460] it
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.100] certainly
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:33.400] wasn't
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:33.540] the
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:33.780] first.
[00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.630] Well,
[00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.750] there
[00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.870] was
[00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.970] a,
[00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:36.230] OK,
[00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.570] probably
[00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:36.730] one
[00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:36.790] of
[00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:36.870] the
[00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:37.030] first
[00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:37.130] was
[00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.330] called
[00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:38.070] mybitcoins
[00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.090].com.
[00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:39.850] And
[00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:40.010] then
[00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.230] it
[00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.330] was
[00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:40.490] sort
[00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:40.590] of
[00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.710] a,
[00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:41.150] I
[00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.250] don't
[00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:41.330] know
[00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.430] if
[00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.590] it
[00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.730] was
[00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:42.130] intentional,
[00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.410] but
[00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:42.550] the
[00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:42.730] joke
[00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:42.950] after
[00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:43.030] it
[00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:43.150] was
[00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:43.270] like,
[00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.470] well,
[00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:43.890] it's
[00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:44.090] his
[00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.430] bitcoins
[00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.690] now.
[00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.770] So
[00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:47.170] it
[00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.010] was
[00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.230] more
[00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.330] of
[00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:48.450] a
[00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:48.650] web
[00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:49.090] wallet
[00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.910] that
[00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:50.130] had
[00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:50.430] private
[00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.770] keys
[00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:51.090] than
[00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:51.290] a
[00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:51.570] actual
[00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:51.930] exchange.
[00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:52.410] But
[00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:52.530] a
[00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:52.630] lot
[00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.730] of
[00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:52.870] these
[00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:53.270] exchanges,
[00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:54.930] they're
[00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:55.090] really
[00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:55.290] easy
[00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:55.450] to
[00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:55.610] set
[00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.810] up.
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.040] You
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.280] just
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:57.900] write
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:58.060] some
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:58.380] software,
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:20:59.380] and
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.220] people
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:00.420] start
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:00.660] sending
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:00.820] you
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.140] coins.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:01.500] And
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:01.680] then
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:01.860] a
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.000] lot
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.120] of,
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:02.740] either
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.000] there's
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.140] like
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.520] internal
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:03.960] problems
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.380] where
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:04.660] you've
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:04.820] got
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.140] some
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:05.580] rogue
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.040] employee,
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:06.400] or
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:06.600] the
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:06.800] rogue
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.200] employee
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:07.380] is
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:07.500] the
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:07.720] only
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.100] employee.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:08.940] And
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:09.420] someone
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:09.640] just
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.040] realizes,
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.400] hey,
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:10.880] this
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.400] computer
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:11.800] in
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:11.960] front
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.080] of
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:12.220] me
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.620] has
[00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:13.670] $20
[00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:13.950] million
[00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:14.390] worth
[00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.510] of
[00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.690] stuff
[00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.870] on
[00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.990] it.
[00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:15.310] Like,
[00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:15.670] I
[00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:15.990] think
[00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.110] I'll
[00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.270] just
[00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:16.590] unplug
[00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.830] it
[00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.210] and
[00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.530] keep
[00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:17.650] all
[00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:17.730] the
[00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:17.930] money.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:20.740] Also,
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.100] hackers,
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:21.460] right?
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.080] They're
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:22.620] probably
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:22.860] the
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.100] best
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.560] targets
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.140] for
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.280] trying
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:25.580] to
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.020] intrude
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:26.200] and
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.380] hack
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:26.560] into
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:26.700] a
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:26.900] system
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:27.080] that
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.180] you
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.280] can
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:27.540] find,
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:27.900] because
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.660] there's
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:28.760] a
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:28.880] whole
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.060] ton
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:29.180] of
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:29.380] money
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:29.540] on
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:29.680] this
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:29.960] computer.
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:30.160] It's
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:30.320] not
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:30.560] like
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.240] data
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:31.620] or,
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:31.880] oh,
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.020] I
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:32.120] get
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.080] someone's
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.740] Facebook
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.340] pictures,
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:34.720] or
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:34.820] I
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:34.960] get
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.640] someone's
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.020] credit
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:36.240] card
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:36.580] numbers.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:36.800] Like,
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.020] yeah,
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.320] that's
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:37.580] nice.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:37.900] But
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.720] bitcoins
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.180] are
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.240] sort
[00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.690] of
[00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:40.970] money,
[00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.110] and
[00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.190] you
[00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.430] steal
[00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.630] them.
[00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:42.290] OK,
[00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.530] so
[00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.950] other
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.300] problems
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:44.420] with
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:44.500] the
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:44.740] exchange
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.000] model
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.200] is
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.340] that
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:45.560] people
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:45.780] tend
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:45.920] to
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.160] trust
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:46.280] it
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:46.380] a
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:46.540] lot.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:46.820] And
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.040] they
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.220] think,
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:47.380] well,
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:47.580] this
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:47.800] is,
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:48.880] they
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.320] assume
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:50.820] that
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.020] it's
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.200] like
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:51.340] a
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:51.580] bank.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:51.800] And
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.000] banks
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.140] are
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:52.300] very
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:52.640] trustworthy,
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:53.680] because
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:53.920] in
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.160] recent
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:54.460] memory,
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:54.620] there
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:54.920] haven't
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.140] really
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:55.440] been
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:55.840] bank
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.120] failures,
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:56.320] at
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:56.420] least
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:56.520] in
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:56.660] this
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:56.880] country.
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.120] So
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.940] they
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.100] sort
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:58.260] of
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:58.740] carry
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:58.940] that
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.200] trust
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.500] forward,
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.040] and
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.380] bad
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:00.580] things
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:00.820] happen.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:01.620] So
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:01.740] the
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.000] idea
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.220] is,
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:02.400] wouldn't
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:02.500] it
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:02.620] be
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:02.920] cool
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.200] if
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:03.360] we
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:03.520] could
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:03.840] have
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.480] cross
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:04.740]-chain
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.180] swaps,
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:05.880] where
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.000] we
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.160] have
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:06.460] some
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:06.840] kind
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:06.980] of
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:07.180] way
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:07.480] where
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.340] I've
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:08.460] got
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:08.560] a
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:08.720] bunch
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:08.840] of
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.040] coin
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.260] A,
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:09.800] you've
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:09.900] got
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.040] a
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:10.180] bunch
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:10.300] of
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:10.480] coin
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:10.700] B,
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:10.940] and
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.080] we
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:11.280] can
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.140] swap
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:12.520] between
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:12.940] them
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.320] without
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:14.720] giving
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.140] custody
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:15.380] to
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:15.560] some
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:15.760] third
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.040] party,
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.200] or
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:16.380] even
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:16.600] giving
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:16.920] custody
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.140] to
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:17.300] each
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:17.540] other?
[00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:18.890] So
[00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:19.270] you
[00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:19.410] can
[00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:19.710] do
[00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.130] this
[00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.070] using
[00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.530] hash
[00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:21.710] time
[00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.910] lock
[00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:22.290] contracts,
[00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.550] just
[00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:22.770] like
[00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:22.870] in
[00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.950] the

[00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:23.450] Network.
[00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:24.810] So
[00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:25.210] you
[00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:25.350] get
[00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.550] this
[00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:25.830] coin
[00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.190] if
[00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.430] and
[00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.750] only
[00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:27.030] if
[00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:27.250] I
[00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:27.390] get
[00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.550] this
[00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:27.730] other
[00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:27.930] coin.
[00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:28.070] You
[00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.250] want
[00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:28.370] them
[00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.490] to
[00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.650] be
[00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:28.990] atomic.
[00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.350] Even
[00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.530] if
[00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:30.730] it's
[00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:30.990] very
[00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.290] quick,
[00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.510] you
[00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.630] don't
[00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.750] want
[00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.030] any

[00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.590] of

[00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:33.370] in
[00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:33.650] which
[00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:34.250] one
[00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.490] party
[00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.710] has
[00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.870] all

[00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:35.590] or
[00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.830] more
[00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.930] of
[00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:36.010] the
[00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:36.250] assets.
[00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:39.450] The
[00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:39.710] interesting
[00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.930] thing
[00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:40.110] about
[00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.370] this
[00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.630] is

[00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:42.730] this
[00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:43.090] already.
[00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:43.990] The

[00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.470] Network
[00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.710] is
[00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.830] a
[00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.990] way
[00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.350] to
[00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.890] make

[00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.090] And
[00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.290] then
[00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:50.430] if
[00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.550] you
[00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:50.770] look
[00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:50.850] at
[00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:50.990] these
[00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.210] channels
[00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:51.370] and
[00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:51.490] say,
[00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:51.750] well,
[00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:52.550] do
[00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:52.710] the
[00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:53.650] channels
[00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:53.890] have
[00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.010] to

[00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.410] Do
[00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:55.490] they
[00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.590] have
[00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.650] to
[00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:55.750] be
[00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.850] the
[00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:55.990] same
[00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.290] blockchain?
[00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.210] And
[00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:57.650] basically,
[00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.970] no.
[00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:58.290] Not
[00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:58.510] much
[00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.850] difference
[00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:59.050] has
[00:22:59.050 --> 00:22:59.190] to
[00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.490] happen
[00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:00.510] for
[00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.710] them
[00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.110] to
[00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.230] be
[00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.510] different
[00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.970] blockchains.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:04.260] OK,
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:04.560] so
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.580] this
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:05.700] is
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:05.820] the
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.220] HTLC
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:06.640] slide
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:06.900] from
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.280] last
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:07.540] time.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.300] It's
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:08.740] similar
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.160] in
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.360] that
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:09.540] you
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:09.880] have
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.160] these
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.400] two
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:10.800] outputs,
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:11.600] the
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:11.820] same
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:11.960] as
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.080] in
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:12.180] a
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:12.380] regular
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:12.680] Lightning
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:12.940] payment
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.240] channel
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:13.460] that's
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:13.580] at
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:13.840] rest.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:15.840] So
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.060] for
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.280] example,
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:16.560] Bob
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:16.780] holds
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.060] this,
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:17.820] where
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.400] if
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:18.500] he
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.020] broadcasts
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.220] this,
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:19.620] Alice
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:19.860] gets
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.060] two
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:20.360] coins
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:20.820] right
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:20.940] off
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:21.060] the
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:21.260] bat.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.080] Bob
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:23.600] needs
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.380] to
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:24.560] wait
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:24.800] 100
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.280] blocks,
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:25.960] or
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.640] Alice
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:27.880] can
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.120] know
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.520] Bob's
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.040] revocation
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.340] key,
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:30.340] and
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:30.440] she
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:30.560] can
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:30.680] get
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:30.920] seven
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.180] coins,
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:31.480] or
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:31.600] he
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:31.760] gets
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:31.860] the
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.020] seven
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:32.280] coins.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:32.940] And
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.040] then
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.180] you've
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:33.320] got
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:33.500] this
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.000] HTLC
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.460] hash
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:34.660] time
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:34.820] lock
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.260] contract,
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:35.760] where
[00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.230] Alice
[00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.530] needs
[00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:38.670] to
[00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:38.810] know
[00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.950] a
[00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.490] preimage.
[00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.930] Well,
[00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.990] yeah,
[00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:42.330] Alice
[00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:42.510] needs
[00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.650] to
[00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:42.770] know
[00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:43.010] R,
[00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:43.930] this
[00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:44.270] receipt.
[00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.810] Or
[00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:46.310] Bob
[00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.990] has
[00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:47.250] to
[00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:47.630] wait.
[00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:48.390] But
[00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.730] the
[00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:49.010] difference
[00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.190] in
[00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.390] waiting
[00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.610] is
[00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.390] this
[00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.810] is
[00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.490] a
[00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:52.510] relative
[00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.870] time
[00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:53.170] lock,
[00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.730] so
[00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:54.070] that
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.760] Bob
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:55.980] has
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.120] to
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:56.300] wait
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:56.780] 100
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.180] blocks
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:57.640] after
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:57.880] he
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.600] broadcasts
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.020] this
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:23:59.680] transaction.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.180] Whereas
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:01.380] in
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:01.560] this
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:01.820] case,
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:02.240] Bob
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:02.500] has
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:02.660] to
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:02.840] wait
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.380] until
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.000] height
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.700] 500
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.100],000,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:05.900] regardless
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:06.160] of
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:06.320] when
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:06.460] he
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.000] broadcasts
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.140] this
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:07.560] transaction.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.100] So
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.220] it
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:08.400] may
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:08.540] be
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:08.740] that
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:08.880] he
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.140] can
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:09.700] broadcast
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.020] this
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:10.400] transaction
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:10.660] and
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.160] immediately
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.660] spend
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.260] by
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:12.540] signing
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:12.840] here,
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:13.600] because
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:13.860] that
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:14.340] time
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:14.520] has
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:14.840] passed.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:15.700] So
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:15.860] it
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.940] seems
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.100] like
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.200] a
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:17.340] small
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:17.640] distinction,
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:17.840] but
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:17.940] it's
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:18.120] actually
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:18.340] pretty
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:18.620] important
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:18.880] for
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.380] this
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:19.500] to
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:19.740] be
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:19.980] just
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.640] absolute
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:20.940] time.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.220] So
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:23.380] that's
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:23.480] how
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:23.580] an
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:23.880] HTLC
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.220] works,
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:24.440] right?
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:24.800] This
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.980] output's
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.400] Alice's,
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:27.800] no
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.320] question.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:28.880] This
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.280] output
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:29.920] should
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.160] be
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.540] Bob's.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:30.740] And
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:30.900] by
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.160] should,
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:31.340] I
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:31.660] mean
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.840] something's
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.120] gone
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:34.760] wrong.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:35.460] Something's
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:35.620] gone
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.020] pretty
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.440] seriously
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:36.940] wrong
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:37.580] if
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:37.840] Alice
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.120] takes
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.300] this
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:38.540] money,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:38.880] right?
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.100] This
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:39.320] only
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:39.540] is
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:39.840] due
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.000] to
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.240] fraud.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:40.460] And
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:40.640] fraud
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:40.780] is
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:40.960] not
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.240] in
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:41.360] a
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:41.620] legal
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:41.860]-defined
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:42.200] sense,
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:42.340] but
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:42.480] we
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:42.820] can
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.080] think
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.260] of,
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:44.960] basically,
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:45.480] this
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:45.580] is
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:45.720] always
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:45.900] going
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:45.940] to
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.040] be
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.380] Alice's.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:46.740] This
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:46.980] is
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.660] approximately
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.080] always
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.280] going
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:48.420] to
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:48.560] be
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:48.880] Bob's.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:49.580] This
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:49.780] one,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:49.920] we're
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.120] really
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:50.320] not
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:50.500] sure,
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:51.640] right?
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:51.940] This
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.160] can
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.520] fail,
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:52.860] and
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.100] it's
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:53.380] not
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:53.540] due
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:53.680] to
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:53.920] any
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.420] malice.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.360] It
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:56.740] should
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:57.340] be
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.440] Alice's,
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:58.820] right?
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.020] You're
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:24:59.440] trying
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:24:59.620] to
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:24:59.780] pay
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.040] Alice
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:00.240] here,
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.020] but
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.280] it
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:01.500] may
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:01.700] well
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:01.820] be
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:01.960] the
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.140] case
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:02.300] that
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:02.440] Bob
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:02.680] takes
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:02.780] it
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.000] back.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:03.920] And
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.160] that's
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:04.480] not
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:04.640] due
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:04.760] to
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.060] fraud.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:05.420] That's
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:05.580] just
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:05.740] due
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:05.940] to
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:06.440] computers
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.100] crashing,
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:07.660] or
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.180] networks
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:08.440] not
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:08.740] working
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.020] right,
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.180] or
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:09.540] something
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:09.800] like
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.020] that.
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:10.660] This
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:10.840] can
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.140] innocently
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.460] be
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:12.840] broadcast
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.560] and
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:13.860] go
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:14.040] back
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.160] to
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:14.380] Bob,
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:14.860] whereas
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.000] this
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.260] can't
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:15.440] really.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:17.680] Any
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:17.960] questions
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.240] about
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:18.740] the
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.200] HTLC,
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.340] basic
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:20.640] idea?
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.340] So
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:23.820] Alice
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:24.080] needs
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.180] to
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:24.300] know
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:24.480] this
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:24.760] secret,
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.260] or
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:25.480] Bob
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:25.680] has
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:25.820] to
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.040] wait
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.580] until
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:26.700] a
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:26.840] certain
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.100] time.
[00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:28.150] OK,
[00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:28.690] so
[00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:29.350] the
[00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.570] cross
[00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.830]-chain
[00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:30.910] swaps
[00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:31.790] is
[00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:32.430] basically
[00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.650] the
[00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:32.830] same
[00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.990] as
[00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.550] a
[00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:33.850] routed
[00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:34.110] payment
[00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.330] in
[00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:34.490] Lightning,
[00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.770] right?
[00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:35.050] Before,
[00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:35.190] we
[00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.350] said,
[00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.550] OK,
[00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:35.930] Alice
[00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:36.490] has
[00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:36.590] a
[00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.770] channel
[00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:36.950] with
[00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:37.270] Bob.
[00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:38.110] Bob
[00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.330] has
[00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.470] a
[00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.670] channel
[00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:38.910] with
[00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:39.130] Carol.
[00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:39.970] And
[00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:40.190] now,
[00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:40.630] Alice
[00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.170] wants
[00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:41.330] to
[00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.550] pay
[00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:41.850] Carol
[00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:42.470] without
[00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.990] opening
[00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.170] a
[00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:43.310] new
[00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.550] channel.
[00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.850] In
[00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:44.990] the
[00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.230] case
[00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.550] of
[00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.110] Lightning,
[00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:46.350] where
[00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.470] it's
[00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.670] all
[00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:46.810] on
[00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:46.930] the
[00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.070] same
[00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.370] blockchain,
[00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.190] Alice
[00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.710] could
[00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.090] open
[00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:49.230] a
[00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.430] payment
[00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.710] channel
[00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.890] to
[00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:50.090] Carol
[00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.430] and
[00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.630] spend
[00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.950] directly
[00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:51.170] that
[00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:51.350] way.
[00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:52.770] In
[00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:52.870] the
[00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:53.030] case
[00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:53.170] where
[00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:53.430] these
[00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.670] two
[00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:53.830] are
[00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.150] different
[00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:54.690] blockchains,
[00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.610] you
[00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:56.090] can't
[00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.430] actually
[00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.630] do
[00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.890] that,
[00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:57.070] right?
[00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.170] You
[00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:57.430] can't
[00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.570] say,
[00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:57.810] oh,
[00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:58.130] I'm
[00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.290] going
[00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:58.450] to,
[00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.950] you
[00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:59.050] know,
[00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.270] there's
[00:25:59.270 --> 00:25:59.550] no
[00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:00.050] defined
[00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:00.490] channel
[00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:00.730] that
[00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:00.870] will
[00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:01.110] link
[00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.290] two
[00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:01.550] different
[00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:01.970] blockchains.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:03.340] OK,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:03.960] the
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.160] other
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:04.460] aspect
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:04.740] is,
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.020] although
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.280] this
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:05.580] can
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:05.820] work
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:05.980] with
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.160] three
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:06.420] parties,
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:06.880] in
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.020] the
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:07.260] case
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:07.520] of
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.100] swaps,
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.360] you're
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:09.780] generally
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.080] not
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.420] saying,
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:10.740] hey,
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.080] Bob,
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.400] I
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:11.580] will
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:11.880] pay
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.320] you
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.380] five
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:13.940] Dogecoins
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.440] if
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:14.660] you
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:14.940] pay
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:15.440] Carol
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.020] 100
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:16.540] Vertcoins.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.220] You're
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:17.520] usually
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:17.940] saying,
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:18.340] if
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:18.460] you
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:18.580] pay
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:18.920] me
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.240] 100
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:19.600] Vertcoins,
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:19.880] right?
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:20.400] So
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.180] yeah,
[00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:22.430] usually,
[00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:22.990] it's
[00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.270] Alice
[00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:23.770] sending
[00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:23.970] to
[00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:24.210] Bob
[00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:24.530] who's
[00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:24.750] sending
[00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.050] back
[00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:25.230] to
[00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.570] Alice.
[00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.690] It
[00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:27.050] still
[00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:27.570] works
[00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:27.790] if
[00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:27.990] this
[00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.130] is
[00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.250] a
[00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.430] third
[00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.670] party,
[00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:28.970] Carol.
[00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.830] But
[00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.950] it
[00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:30.090] sort
[00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:30.190] of
[00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.410] doesn't
[00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:30.590] make
[00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.710] as
[00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.850] much
[00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:31.110] sense,
[00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.370] because
[00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:31.730] generally,
[00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.890] you're
[00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:32.090] saying,
[00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.270] hey,
[00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:32.390] I'll
[00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.550] give
[00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:32.630] you
[00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.810] this
[00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.950] if
[00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:33.030] you
[00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:33.150] give
[00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:33.230] me
[00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.430] that.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:35.940] OK,
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.120] so
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.220] in
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:36.360] this
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:36.580] case,
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:36.880] we
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.200] have
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:37.760] two
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:37.980] different
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:38.340] blockchains.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:38.460] You
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:38.580] know,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.140] we've
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:39.380] actually
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:39.680] reduced
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:39.820] the
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:40.000] number
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.360] of
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:40.760] parties,
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.020] where
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.180] it's
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.340] just
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:41.560] Alice
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:41.700] and
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:41.880] Bob.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:42.780] But
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:43.000] we've
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.140] got
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.300] two
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:43.500] different
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:43.900] blockchains.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.100] We've
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:44.260] got
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:44.680] Dogecoin,
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.080] which
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:45.340] I
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:45.500] think
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:45.680] is,
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:45.960] like,
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:46.240] yellow,
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:46.540] right?
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:46.760] And
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:46.960] then
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.280] Vertcoin
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:47.440] is,
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:47.600] like,
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.000] green
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.520]-ish.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:50.900] You
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.100] can't,
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:51.300] oh,
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:51.460] because
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:51.540] they
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:51.600] don't
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:51.740] have
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:51.980] Segwit.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.220] Well,
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:53.580] say
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.080] Dogecoin
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.520] upgrades
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:54.780] pretty
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.060] soon.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.080] So
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:57.400] you
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:57.780] could,
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.060] but
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:58.440] you'd
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:58.560] have
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:58.660] to
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:58.820] write
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:58.940] a
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:26:59.040] lot
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.140] of
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:26:59.300] code
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:26:59.460] to
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:26:59.620] deal
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:26:59.760] with
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:26:59.940] that,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.160] yeah.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:01.580] It's
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:01.780] way
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.040] easier
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:02.180] to
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:02.340] just
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:02.680] merge
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:02.800] in.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:04.380] They
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:04.480] don't
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:04.600] have
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.320] CheckSequenceVerify
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:05.440] at
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:05.560] all.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:07.240] There's
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:07.480] probably
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:07.780] ways
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:07.940] around
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.020] it.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:08.120] But
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:08.340] yeah,
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:08.920] just
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.540] upgrade.
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:10.380] Who's
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:10.520] in
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:10.740] charge
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:10.940] of
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.400] Doge?
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.200] I
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:12.300] don't
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:12.480] know.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:12.800] Yeah,
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.080] tell
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:13.200] them
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:13.320] to
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.640] upgrade.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:14.440] So
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:14.560] a
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:14.660] lot
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:14.740] of
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:14.900] these
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.360] altcoins,
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.080] they
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.120] have
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.420] sort
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:18.560] of
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.040] archaeological
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.040] aspects
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.240] to
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:20.340] them,
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:20.460] where
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:20.560] you
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:20.680] can
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:20.920] see
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:21.200] where
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:21.380] they
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:21.780] branched
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:21.940] off
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:22.080] of
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.320] the
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:22.520] main
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:22.820] Bitcoin
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:23.080] code
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.360] base.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.080] Because
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:24.220] a
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:24.300] lot
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:24.360] of
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:24.540] times,
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:24.620] they
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:24.740] don't
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:24.900] get
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.220] updated,
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:25.860] because
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:26.420] no
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:26.580] one's
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:26.740] really
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:26.960] working
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.160] on
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:27.340] them.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.280] Despite
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:28.560] no
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:28.700] one
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:28.960] really
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.360] working
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:29.620] on
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:29.760] them
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:29.880] or
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.120] looking
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:30.300] at
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:30.460] them,
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:30.660] they
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:30.800] can
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:30.960] still
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.120] be
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.380] worth
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:31.900] a
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.100] billion
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.580] dollars,
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:32.880] as
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:32.980] I
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.160] think
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.360] Doge
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:33.600] was
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:33.940] a
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:34.040] few
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:34.220] months
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:34.420] ago.
[00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:36.950] But
[00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:37.350] so
[00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.730] sometimes
[00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.930] they
[00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:38.110] catch
[00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.290] up,
[00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.370] and
[00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:38.470] they're
[00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.570] like,
[00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.670] oh,
[00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:39.150] let's
[00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:39.370] take
[00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:39.530] all
[00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:39.670] the
[00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:39.870] code
[00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:40.090] from
[00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:40.370] Bitcoin
[00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.610] that
[00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.870] they've
[00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:41.150] developed
[00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:41.310] for
[00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.410] the
[00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:41.570] last
[00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.750] few
[00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.950] years
[00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:42.170] and
[00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:42.610] apply
[00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:42.830] it.
[00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:43.810] Sometimes
[00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:44.170] the
[00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:44.430] opposite
[00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.810] happens,
[00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.990] where
[00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.090] an
[00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:45.410] altcoin
[00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:45.630] will
[00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.870] make
[00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:46.090] something
[00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:46.410] cool,
[00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:46.670] and
[00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:46.930] people
[00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:47.050] in
[00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:47.250] Bitcoin
[00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:47.590] will
[00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:48.490] merge
[00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:48.590] it
[00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.690] in.
[00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.850] But
[00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:49.810] it's
[00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:50.250] generally
[00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:50.450] the
[00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.690] opposite.
[00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:51.970] OK,
[00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.310] so
[00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:53.950] you've
[00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:54.230] got
[00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.830] these
[00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:55.010] two
[00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.350] channels
[00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.550] that
[00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:55.670] have
[00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:55.830] been
[00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:56.030] set
[00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:56.210] up.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.000] And
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.280] Alice
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:58.620] wants
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.060] to
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.440] sell
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:00.620] her
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:00.980] Dogecoin
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:01.320] and
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:01.560] buy
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:01.900] Vertcoin.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:03.240] So
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:03.840] you
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:03.940] have
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.080] the
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.400] same
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:04.820] HTLC
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.420] construction,
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:05.840] where
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.840] Alice,
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:09.300] what's
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:09.560] interesting
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:09.760] in
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:09.920] this
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.180] case
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:10.300] is
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:10.380] that
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:10.600] it's
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:10.740] the
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:10.900] same
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.140] person
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.280] on
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:11.420] both
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:11.640] sides.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:11.800] So
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.080] there's
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:12.300] actually
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:12.500] some
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.040] optimizations
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:13.260] you
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:13.380] can
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:13.540] do.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:13.960] But
[00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.890] forget
[00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:15.050] those
[00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:15.170] for
[00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:15.290] a
[00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:15.410] second.
[00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.350] Alice
[00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.690] computes
[00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:16.810] a
[00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:16.990] random
[00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:17.290] number,
[00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.990] r,
[00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:18.830] hashes
[00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.010] it
[00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.170] to
[00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:19.350] make
[00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.630] h.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:20.780] She
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.100] sends
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:21.220] it
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:21.360] to
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:21.740] herself,
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:21.980] which
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:22.220] doesn't
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:22.380] really
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:22.580] make
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:22.740] any
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:22.940] sense
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.040] in
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:23.200] this
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:23.440] case.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:23.860] So
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:24.080] you
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.200] can
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.400] skip
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:24.720] that
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.060] step.
[00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.550] Alice
[00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:26.890] already
[00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:27.350] knows
[00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.650] h
[00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:27.810] and
[00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:28.050] already
[00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:28.350] knows
[00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.590] r,
[00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.910] so
[00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:29.430] yeah.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.000] But
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:32.640] Alice
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:32.960] doesn't
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.140] have
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:33.240] to
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:33.400] be
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:33.640] Alice,
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:33.860] right?
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:34.000] It
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.280] could
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:34.520] be
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:34.780] Carol.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:35.240] So
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.840] there's
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.360] optimizations
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:36.620] that
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:36.700] you
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:36.780] can
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:36.900] do
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:37.020] when
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:37.120] they're
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:37.220] the
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:37.360] same
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:37.620] person.
[00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:39.450] OK,
[00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.690] so
[00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:39.890] she
[00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:40.390] constructs
[00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:40.510] an
[00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:40.930] HTLC
[00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:41.230] to
[00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.450] Bob
[00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:41.790] and
[00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:41.950] says,
[00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.230] OK,
[00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:42.890] if
[00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:43.390] Bob
[00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:43.670] knows
[00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:44.070] r,
[00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.450] he
[00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.610] gets
[00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:44.810] this
[00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:45.070] money.
[00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:46.210] Otherwise,
[00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:46.670] Alice
[00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:46.930] gets
[00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:47.070] it
[00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.330] after
[00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.610] 5
[00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:47.770] o
[00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:47.970]'clock.
[00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:49.550] Bob
[00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:49.770] says,
[00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:50.130] OK,
[00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:51.090] I
[00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:51.890] don't
[00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.070] know
[00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.290] r,
[00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.490] so
[00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.630] I
[00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.890] can't
[00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:53.050] get
[00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:53.270] these
[00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:53.670] Dogecoins.
[00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:53.970] Bob
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.320] then
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:55.740] forwards
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:55.880] it
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.020] to
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.320] Alice
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:56.580] and
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:56.780] saying,
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.060] OK,
[00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.590] if
[00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.970] Alice
[00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:59.270] knows
[00:28:59.270 --> 00:28:59.530] r,
[00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:01.570] she
[00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:01.730] gets
[00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:01.890] the
[00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.170] coins.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:03.640] If
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.240] Bob
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:04.700] waits
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.020] till
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:05.280] after
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:05.600] 4
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:05.760] o
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:05.900]'clock,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.140] he
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:06.300] gets
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:06.440] the
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:06.640] coins.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.280] So
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:09.480] it's
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:09.620] sort
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:09.700] of
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:09.840] like,
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.120] why
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:10.520] make
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:10.980] this
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:11.700] construction?
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:11.920] It
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.180] actually
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:12.400] still
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:12.680] makes
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.120] sense,
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:13.840] because
[00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:15.930] even
[00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.110] though
[00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.450] Bob
[00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.030] knows
[00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:17.250] that
[00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:17.490] Alice
[00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:17.830] knows
[00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.230] r,
[00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:19.290] Alice
[00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:19.810] will
[00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:20.070] have
[00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.310] to
[00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.850] reveal
[00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.230] r
[00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:22.110] in
[00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.510] order
[00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.930] to
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.500] take
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:26.640] the
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:26.880] coins,
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:27.460] right?
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.100] So
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:28.220] it's
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:28.360] saying,
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:28.520] OK,
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:28.680] you
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:28.840] need
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:28.960] to
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.120] know
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:29.400] r,
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:29.700] and
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:29.780] you
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:29.920] need
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.060] to
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.460] not
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:30.640] just
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:30.820] know
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:30.960] r,
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:31.080] but
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:31.160] you
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:31.260] have
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:31.320] to
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:31.500] show
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:31.800] everyone.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.600] Because
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.200] the
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:33.480] actual
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:33.720] script
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.000] says,
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:34.260] OK,
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:34.720] you
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:34.900] need
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:35.000] to
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.120] know
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.280] the
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:35.680] preimage
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.200] of
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:36.580] this
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.520] 20
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:37.740]-byte
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.060] hash.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.060] And
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.200] when
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:39.320] you
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:39.600] actually
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.180] spend,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:40.960] you
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.120] have
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:41.220] to
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:41.380] put
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:41.600] that
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:41.960] preimage
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.520] in
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:42.700] the
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.000] blockchain,
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:43.320] right?
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:43.380] You
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:43.480] have
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:43.540] to
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:43.680] put
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:43.780] it
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:43.880] in
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:43.980] your
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.280] input
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:44.980] for
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:45.120] your
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:45.560] transaction,
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:46.300] and
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:46.460] then
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:46.680] Bob
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:46.860] can
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.060] see
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.200] it.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.660] So
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:47.860] the
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.140] idea
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:48.380] is,
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.100] if
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:49.340] Alice
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:49.700] closes
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:49.960] this
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.220] channel
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:50.420] on
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:50.780] VertCoin,
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:51.520] takes
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:51.720] the
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.100] coins
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.520] by
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:52.820] using
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.100] r,
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:53.680] Bob
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:53.840] will
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.080] know
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.300] r,
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:54.480] and
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:54.640] Bob
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:54.740] will
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:54.860] know
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.020] it's
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.140] the
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:55.340] same
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:55.600] r
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.000] that
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.120] he
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:56.280] can
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:56.480] use
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:56.620] to
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:56.780] take
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:56.940] the
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.240] coins
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.180] on
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:58.300] the
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:58.640] Dogecoin
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.140] network.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:01.140] OK,
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:01.300] so
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:01.420] you
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:01.640] add
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:01.960] these
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.360] two
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.160] HTLCs.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:04.540] You
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:04.940] then
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.480] clear
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:05.660] them
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:05.940] out.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:06.400] So
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:06.820] Alice,
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:07.500] instead
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:07.820] of
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.760] revealing
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.020] r
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:09.200] on
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:09.320] the
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.620] blockchain,
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:10.380] Alice
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:10.520] can
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:10.680] just
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.280] reveal
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:11.540] r
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:11.960] directly
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.160] to
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:12.360] Bob.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:13.760] Say,
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.020] OK,
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:14.460] I'm
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:14.700] clearing
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:14.900] out
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.060] this
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:15.480] HTLC,
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.060] because
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:16.600] here's
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:16.800] r.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:17.280] You
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.560] know
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:17.740] that
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:17.880] I
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.020] can
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:18.180] do
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:18.480] this.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:18.700] So
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.400] just
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:19.900] give
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.040] me
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:20.200] the
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:20.480] coins.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:21.000] You
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.280] also
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:21.540] know
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:21.720] r,
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:21.900] so
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.060] you
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:22.180] can
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:22.360] take
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:22.520] the
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:22.680] coins
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.080] yourself
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:23.900] if
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.020] I
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:24.200] don't
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:24.540] cooperate
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:24.740] on
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:24.920] that
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.160] end.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.220] But
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:26.480] hopefully,
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:26.680] she
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:26.900] does.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:27.140] So
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:27.360] then
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:27.520] you
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:27.800] get
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:27.960] rid
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.020] of
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.120] the
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:28.520] HTLC.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:28.840] Now
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:28.960] it's
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.100] back
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:29.260] down
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:29.360] to
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:29.500] two
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:29.880] outputs.
[00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:33.570] There.
[00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:34.590] And
[00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.730] then
[00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:34.930] Bob
[00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:35.130] says,
[00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.410] OK,
[00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:36.490] I've
[00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:37.090] lost
[00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:37.350] the
[00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.790] VertCoin,
[00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:38.310] and
[00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.390] I
[00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:38.650] haven't
[00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:39.030] really
[00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:39.310] gotten
[00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.810] the
[00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:40.190] Dogecoin
[00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.470] yet.
[00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:40.950] But
[00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:41.030] I
[00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:41.130] know
[00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.270] I
[00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:41.470] can
[00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.730] close
[00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:41.850] the
[00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:42.050] channel
[00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:42.210] and
[00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:42.370] take
[00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:42.470] it
[00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.610] if
[00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:42.950] need
[00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:43.130] be.
[00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:44.150] And
[00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:44.250] then
[00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:44.450] Bob
[00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.630] goes
[00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.750] to
[00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.010] Alice.
[00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:45.610] She
[00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:45.810] already
[00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:46.030] knows
[00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:46.190] r,
[00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:46.410] but
[00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:46.730] look,
[00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.010] you
[00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:48.210] know
[00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:48.350] that
[00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.470] I
[00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.610] know
[00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:48.790] r.
[00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:49.070] Let's
[00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.230] clear
[00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.530] this.
[00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.690] And
[00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.830] then
[00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:51.050] Alice
[00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:51.210] can
[00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:51.410] just
[00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:51.830] send
[00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:52.030] the
[00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.270] coins
[00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:52.510] that
[00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:52.670] way.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.140] OK,
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:56.360] so
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:56.520] any
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:56.900] questions
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:57.480] about
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.340] this
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:58.520] setup?
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:58.920] Yes?
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.080] Because
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:00.400] there's
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:00.900] latency,
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:01.220] can
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:01.300] I
[00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:02.790] mess
[00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:03.030] with
[00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.270] Bob,
[00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.810] basically,
[00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.490] take
[00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.670] the
[00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:05.290] VertCoin
[00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:05.790] before
[00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:06.710] Bob
[00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.890] has
[00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:07.010] a
[00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:07.270] chance
[00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:07.370] to
[00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.490] get
[00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.650] the
[00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:08.050] Doge,
[00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.790] basically
[00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:09.150] screw
[00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:09.470] Bob?
[00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.390] Yeah.
[00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.790] Well,
[00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:12.010] that's
[00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:12.150] why
[00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:12.290] you
[00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:12.410] have
[00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:12.710] different
[00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:13.270] times
[00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:13.510] here.
[00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.830] So
[00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:15.310] yes,
[00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:15.510] that
[00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:15.650] is
[00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:15.970] possible,
[00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:16.170] that
[00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:16.290] you
[00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:16.510] could
[00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.050] get
[00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.190] to
[00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.410] this
[00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:17.750] step.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:20.420] And
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:20.560] then
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:20.760] Alice
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:20.980] goes
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.400] offline
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:21.640] and
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:21.860] shuts
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:22.020] the
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:22.300] channels
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:22.520] down,
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:22.920] closes
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.100] the
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:23.360] channels.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:23.980] But
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.060] the
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:24.240] idea
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:24.380] is
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:24.540] that
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:24.900] Bob
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.420] can
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.540] grab
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:27.940] these
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.200] coins
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:28.660] back
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.280] after
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:29.640] 4
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:29.960] PM,
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:30.900] whereas
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.320] Alice
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:31.900] has
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.020] to
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.140] wait
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:32.320] until
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:32.620] 5
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:32.860] PM
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:33.140] to
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:33.340] grab
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:33.540] these
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:33.720] coins
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.000] back.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:36.840] So
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:37.040] if
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.460] Alice
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.120] closes
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.080] and
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:39.360] tries
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.560] to
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:39.740] wait
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.060] till
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:40.620] right
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.780] before
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.160] 4
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:42.480] PM
[00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.750] and
[00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.030] then
[00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:44.730] immediately
[00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.130] grab
[00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:45.330] these
[00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:45.670] coins,
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.220] Bob's
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:47.480] actually
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:47.820] OK,
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:48.260] because
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:48.500] Bob
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:48.660] says,
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:48.880] OK,
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.100] well,
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:49.260] you
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:49.560] grabbed
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:49.920] the
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.460] VertCoins,
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.100] but
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:51.200] I
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:51.380] actually
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:51.520] have
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:51.760] another
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.180] hour
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.860] until
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.880] I
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.200] have
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:54.420] to,
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.500] I
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:55.620] have
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:55.740] an
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:55.980] hour
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.220] to
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:56.520] reveal
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:56.740] r,
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:56.940] where
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:57.140] you're
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:57.340] not
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:57.560] able
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:57.700] to
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:57.840] get
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.020] these
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:58.180] coins
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.460] back.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:31:59.640] So
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.280] having
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:00.580] this
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.200] incrementing
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:01.500] time
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:01.760] can
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:01.980] help
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.200] against
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:02.440] that.
[00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:05.210] Yeah,
[00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.330] an
[00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:06.450] hour
[00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:06.610] is
[00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:07.070] probably
[00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.350] not
[00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.770] enough.
[00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:09.130] The
[00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:09.390] trade
[00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:09.550]-offs
[00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:09.690] to
[00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:09.910] having
[00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:10.170] these
[00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:10.550] times
[00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.070] is,
[00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:11.930] if
[00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:12.090] you
[00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:12.390] have
[00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:12.570] it
[00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:13.130] very
[00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:13.370] far
[00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.490] in
[00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.590] the
[00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.810] future
[00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:14.030] with
[00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:14.250] very
[00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:14.530] large
[00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:14.890] gaps,
[00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:16.230] those
[00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.930] HTLCs
[00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:17.050] can
[00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:17.210] get
[00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.470] stuck
[00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.690] there.
[00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:18.370] And
[00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.330] if
[00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:19.750] Alice
[00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:20.010] just
[00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:20.270] says,
[00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:20.510] look,
[00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.830] I'm
[00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:21.330] leaving
[00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:21.610] this
[00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:21.810] third
[00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:22.110] output
[00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.270] in
[00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:22.370] the
[00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.810] transaction,
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.120] that
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:25.260] can
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:25.380] be
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:25.640] annoying.
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.320] Or
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:26.480] if
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:26.740] it
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.120] gets
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:27.340] stuck
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:27.540] on
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:27.820] chain,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.160] it
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:28.280] might
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:28.480] take
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:28.580] a
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:28.740] long
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.040] time
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:29.280] to
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:29.400] get
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:29.520] it
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:29.740] back.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:30.600] But
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:30.720] so
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:30.960] you
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.180] want
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:31.320] it
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.180] long
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:32.360] enough
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:32.660] times
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:32.800] that
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:32.880] you
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.040] don't
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:33.480] worry
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:33.800] about
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.020] these
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:34.260] timing
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:34.640] attacks,
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:34.840] where
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.280] someone
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:36.700] immediately
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.140] broadcasts,
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:37.260] and
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:37.440] now
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:37.600] you
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:37.780] only
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:37.960] have
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.080] an
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:38.340] hour,
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:38.600] and
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.040] maybe
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:39.220] the
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:39.660] blockchain's
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.920] congested,
[00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:42.590] versus
[00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.950] the
[00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:43.390] annoyance
[00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:43.670] of,
[00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.030] oh,
[00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:44.750] it
[00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.250] closed,
[00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:45.470] and
[00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.690] now
[00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:45.830] I
[00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.950] have
[00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:46.050] to
[00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:46.250] wait
[00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.650] until
[00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:46.930] 5
[00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:47.110] PM.
[00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.830] So
[00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:48.310] those
[00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.410] are
[00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:48.510] the
[00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:48.690] trade
[00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:48.810]-offs
[00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:49.030] there.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:50.200] Any
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:50.420] other
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:50.900] questions?
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:32:59.220] OK,
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:32:59.680] so
[00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.590] cross
[00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:02.750]-chain
[00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.110] swaps,
[00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:03.430] right?
[00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:03.950] H
[00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:04.130] can
[00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.010] be
[00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:05.410] revealed,
[00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.950] sorry,
[00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:06.390] r.
[00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:06.890] Well,
[00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:07.190] H
[00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.730] goes
[00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:07.930] into
[00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:08.130] either
[00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:08.390] chain.
[00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:08.750] R
[00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.890] is
[00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:09.050] then
[00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:09.370] revealed
[00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:09.550] on
[00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:09.690] either
[00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:09.990] chain,
[00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:10.650] so
[00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:10.790] that
[00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:10.990] both
[00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.550] parties
[00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:13.810] need
[00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:13.970] to
[00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:14.250] watch
[00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:14.590] both
[00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:15.130] blockchains.
[00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:16.650] This
[00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:16.790] sort
[00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:16.870] of
[00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:17.070] makes
[00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.390] sense,
[00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:17.590] right,
[00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:17.790] in
[00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:17.910] that
[00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:18.070] the
[00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.470] channels
[00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.770] are
[00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:20.090] on
[00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:20.230] two
[00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.430] different
[00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.910] blockchains,
[00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:21.170] and
[00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:21.430] both
[00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.730] parties
[00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:22.090] have
[00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:22.230] a
[00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.530] channel
[00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:22.910] on
[00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.210] each.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.440] So
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:25.880] the
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.140] receiver
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:26.400] doesn't
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:26.520] need
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:26.600] to
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:26.700] be
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:26.800] an
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.100] initiator,
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:27.320] so
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:27.580] it
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:27.800] doesn't
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:27.920] have
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.000] to
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:28.140] be
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:28.280] Alice
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:28.460] on
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:28.640] both
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:28.880] sides.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:29.060] But
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:29.200] in
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:29.580] most
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:29.840] cases,
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:29.980] I
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:30.080] think
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:30.180] it
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:30.400] probably
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:30.600] will
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:30.780] be.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:32.620] So
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:32.880] yeah,
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.040] Alice
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:34.420] has
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:34.520] a
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:34.760] Vertcoin
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.120] channel.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:35.420] Alice
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:35.660] also
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:35.880] has
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.540] a
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:36.860] Dogecoin
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:37.140] channel,
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:37.420] as
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:37.620] does
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:37.860] Bob.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:38.560] So
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:38.680] they
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:38.820] need
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:38.900] to
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.220] be
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:39.600] operating
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:39.880] on
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.060] both
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:40.460] networks.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:41.120] There
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:41.480] are
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.100] possibilities
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:42.380] where
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:42.500] if
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:42.600] you
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:42.880] had,
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:43.240] say,
[00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:45.050] this
[00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:45.230] was
[00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.550] Carol,
[00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:46.010] and
[00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:46.250] she
[00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.510] sent
[00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:46.730] to
[00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:47.230] Dave
[00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:48.050] using
[00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.090] Litecoin.
[00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.890] So
[00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:51.050] if
[00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:51.110] you
[00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.230] had
[00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.570] Alice,
[00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:52.030] Bob,
[00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.850] Carol,
[00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.530] Dave,
[00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.590] Doge,
[00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:55.230] Vertcoin,
[00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.830] Litecoin,
[00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:57.210] Alice
[00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:57.490] would
[00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:58.130] not
[00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.730] have
[00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:59.250] to
[00:33:59.250 --> 00:33:59.870] know
[00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.090] about
[00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:00.370] anything
[00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:00.590] but
[00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.930] Dogecoin.
[00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:01.710] So
[00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.870] you
[00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:02.270] actually
[00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:02.650] only
[00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:02.930] have
[00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.130] to
[00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:03.430] worry
[00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.990] about
[00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.910] the
[00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:05.330] networks
[00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.710] that
[00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.490] you
[00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:06.650] have
[00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:06.950] channels
[00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:07.410] in,
[00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:07.930] even
[00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:08.270] though
[00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.550] there
[00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.770] are
[00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:09.110] secrets
[00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:09.470] that
[00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.730] could
[00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:10.150] appear
[00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:10.370] in
[00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:10.610] other.
[00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.790] Well,
[00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:11.910] no,
[00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:12.090] sorry,
[00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:12.330] that's
[00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:12.430] not
[00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:12.590] true.
[00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.870] So
[00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:15.070] if
[00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.410] this
[00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:15.550] is
[00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:15.830] Carol,
[00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.510] Alice
[00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.770] does
[00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:17.930] have
[00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:18.070] to
[00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:18.210] look
[00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:18.330] at
[00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:18.630] Vertcoin,
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:18.870] because
[00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.250] the
[00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.570] Vertcoin
[00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:20.010] network
[00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:20.370] could
[00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.890] show
[00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:23.170] things.
[00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.310] So
[00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.370] you
[00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:23.470] have
[00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.550] to
[00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.710] look
[00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.810] at
[00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:24.070] one
[00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:24.610] additional
[00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:25.050] chain.
[00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:26.470] So
[00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.970] that's
[00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:27.130] one
[00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:27.210] of
[00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:27.310] the
[00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.590] issues
[00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:27.950] with
[00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:28.410] cross
[00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:28.570]-chain
[00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:28.870] swaps,
[00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:29.150] where
[00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.790] you
[00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:31.310] may
[00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.650] be
[00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:33.870] routing
[00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:34.110] through
[00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:34.210] a
[00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:34.390] network
[00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:34.570] that
[00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:34.690] you're
[00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:34.850] not
[00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:35.070] aware
[00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:35.750] of,
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.240] essentially.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:36.800] I
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:36.980] don't
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:37.340] think
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:37.640] that's
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:37.900] that
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.520] likely
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:38.860] in
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.200] practice.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:39.700] So
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.320] it
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:40.500] could
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:40.740] be,
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.420] I'll
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:41.620] send
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:41.740] you
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:41.980] five
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.400] Dogecoins
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:42.800] if
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:42.980] you
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.220] send
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:43.420] her
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:43.980] 20
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.420] Litecoins,
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:45.980] and
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.240] then
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:46.560] you
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:46.760] send
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.060] back
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:47.540] Dogecoins
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:47.740] to
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:47.900] this
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:48.060] other
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.400] place.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.260] But
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:49.420] it's
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:49.680] possible.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.180] I
[00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:50.670] just
[00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:50.790] want
[00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.850] to
[00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:50.990] make
[00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.130] sure
[00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:51.470] that's
[00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:52.050] nice.
[00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:54.270] So
[00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.430] when
[00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.570] they're
[00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:54.890] both
[00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:55.390] Alice,
[00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.010] essentially,
[00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:57.010] that
[00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:57.390] scenario
[00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.650] is
[00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:58.030] Alice
[00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.290] is
[00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.190] exchanging
[00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.150] Dogecoin
[00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.610] for
[00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:01.130] Vertcoin.
[00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:01.590] Yes.
[00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:02.190] And
[00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.370] then
[00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:02.550] if
[00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.570] on
[00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:03.730] the
[00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:03.950] right
[00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:04.190] is
[00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.590] Carol,
[00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:05.010] that's
[00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:05.350] saying
[00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:06.490] Alice
[00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:06.730] is
[00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:06.890] going
[00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:07.110] to
[00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:07.730] pay
[00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:08.930] Carol
[00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:09.550] in
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.180] Dogecoin,
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:11.400] even
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:11.600] though
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:11.920] she's
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.420] receiving
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.580] Vertcoin.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.020] Right.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:14.940] Carol
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:15.560] receives
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.500] Vertcoin.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:17.340] Alice
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:17.820] loses
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.280] Dogecoin.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:18.460] So
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:18.620] there's
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:18.740] an
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.200] exchange.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:19.840] Yeah.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.280] So
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:20.440] it's
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.040] like
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:21.320] you're
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.060] paying
[00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.670] US
[00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:25.090] dollars,
[00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.310] and
[00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.470] then
[00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:25.850] receiving
[00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:26.170] those.
[00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.610] Yeah.
[00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:27.150] So
[00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.490] you
[00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:27.630] go
[00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:27.770] to
[00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.890] some
[00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.050] other
[00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:28.230] country.
[00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.610] You
[00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:28.750] go
[00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:29.070] to
[00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.290] England,
[00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.590] you
[00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:30.770] pay
[00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.930] with
[00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:31.050] your
[00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:31.190] credit
[00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.510] card.
[00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.790] You
[00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:32.090] lose
[00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:32.510] dollars,
[00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:32.770] but
[00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:32.970] they
[00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:33.190] get
[00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.650] pounds.
[00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:34.210] And
[00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:34.450] there's
[00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:34.850] some,
[00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.830] somehow,
[00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:36.850] there's
[00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:36.950] an
[00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:37.290] exchanger
[00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:37.410] in
[00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:37.510] the
[00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.950] middle.
[00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.330] And
[00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:38.510] so
[00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.830] from
[00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:39.110] Bob's
[00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:39.470] perspective,
[00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.790] it
[00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:40.030] works
[00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.170] the
[00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:40.290] same
[00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:40.430] either
[00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.590] way.
[00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:40.830] He's
[00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:41.030] getting
[00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.230] more
[00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.610] Dogecoins
[00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:41.950] and
[00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:42.210] losing
[00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:42.590] Vertcoins.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:43.440] So
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:43.780] Bob
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:43.960] needs
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.120] to
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:44.300] have
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:44.500] a
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:44.720] lot
[00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.950] of,
[00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:46.270] well,
[00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:47.030] he
[00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.230] just
[00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.730] understates
[00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:47.890] how
[00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:48.090] good
[00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:48.250] he
[00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:48.470] needs
[00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:49.070] Vertcoins.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.060] Right,
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:50.340] right.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:50.520] So
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:50.740] it's
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.120] possible
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:51.900] that
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.040] you
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:52.240] set
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:52.380] up
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:52.680] this
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.240] by
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.260] initially
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:54.700] funding
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:54.940] it.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:55.240] So
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:55.560] Alice
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:55.760] says,
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:55.940] I
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.040] have
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.140] a
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:56.240] ton
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:56.320] of
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:56.660] Dogecoins.
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:57.460] Alice
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:57.880] creates
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.100] this
[00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.400] channel,
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:58.580] and
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:58.720] she
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:58.920] has
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.100] like
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:35:59.380] 100
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:35:59.820] Dogecoins,
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:00.160] and
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:00.300] Bob
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:00.480] has
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:00.720] zero.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.120] And
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.520] same
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:02.900] with
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.180] Vertcoin,
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.460] Bob
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:03.600] could
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:03.720] have
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:03.820] a
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:03.940] lot
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:04.040] of
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:04.180] them
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:04.420] and
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:04.540] say,
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:04.700] OK,
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:04.880] I
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.120] have
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:05.540] 20
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.120] Vertcoins,
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:06.340] and
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:06.540] Alice
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:06.720] has
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:06.980] zero.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:07.740] And
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:07.840] then
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:07.960] we
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.060] can
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:08.200] make
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:08.360] those
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:08.600] payments
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:08.760] in
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:08.900] that
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:09.200] direction.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:11.640] You
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:11.840] can
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.100] pay
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:12.420] them.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:13.120] So
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.340] actually,
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:14.540] in
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:14.780] all
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:14.920] the
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.160] software
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:15.520] now,
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:15.720] I
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.140] think
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:16.960] there's
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.440] only
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:17.980] single
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:18.320]-funded
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.780] channels,
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.180] because
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:20.480] having
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:20.800] both
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.160] parties
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:21.480] funded
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:21.640] at
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:21.760] the
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:21.900] same
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.120] time
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:22.240] is
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:22.420] kind
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:22.580] of,
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.520] software
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:24.800]-wise,
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:24.920] a
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.020] little
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:25.300] harder.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:25.860] And
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.020] it's
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:26.220] also
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:26.820] interface
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.140]-wise
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:27.360] going
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:27.560] to
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:27.840] be
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.660] complicated,
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.160] because
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160] how
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:30.320] do
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:30.500] you
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.060] know
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:31.940] when
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.160] to
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.440] match
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.020] someone's
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:33.320] funding?
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:34.600] So
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.180] usually,
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:35.420] what
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:35.520] you
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:35.740] do
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:36.100] is
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:36.200] you
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:36.420] say,
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:36.820] I'm
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.080] Alice.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:37.600] Hey,
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:37.780] Bob,
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.180] what's
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:38.280] your
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:38.500] public
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:38.700] key?
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:39.160] Give
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:39.220] me
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:39.300] a
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:39.400] new
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:39.620] public
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:39.820] key.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:40.680] OK,
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.000] I'm
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.080] going
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:41.160] to
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.440] construct
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:41.680] this
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.000] channel.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:42.400] Here,
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:42.680] sign
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:42.960] this.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:43.320] And
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:43.560] Bob's
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:43.680] like,
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:43.920] OK.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:44.900] And
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:45.080] Bob
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.240] has
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.000] no
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.260] money
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:46.440] at
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:46.600] stake
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:46.780] when
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.160] this
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:47.500] process
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:47.740] happens.
[00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.590] And
[00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:49.030] then
[00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.290] Bob
[00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:49.710] also
[00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:50.270] creates
[00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.390] a
[00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.610] channel
[00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:50.750] with
[00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.930] Alice,
[00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.170] saying,
[00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:51.350] OK,
[00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:51.510] I'm
[00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.570] going
[00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:51.610] to
[00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:51.750] put
[00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.830] a
[00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:51.970] bunch
[00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:52.070] of
[00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:52.310] Vertcoin
[00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.470] in
[00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.610] this
[00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:52.850] channel.
[00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:53.470] And
[00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.630] they
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.870] usually
[00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:54.310] start
[00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.670] with
[00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:55.210] all
[00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:55.310] the
[00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.430] money
[00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.590] on
[00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:55.790] one
[00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:56.050] side,
[00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.550] so
[00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.630] they
[00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.750] can
[00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.890] then
[00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:57.090] trade.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.120] Other
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:00.520] questions?
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.040] Yeah,
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:02.420] so
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.520] they
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:04.960] have
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.080] to
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:05.220] look
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:05.320] at
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:05.500] these
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:05.760] different
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.240] channels
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:06.760] on
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:06.980] different
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:07.500] blockchains
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:07.980] in
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.080] order
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:08.200] to
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:08.320] make
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:08.400] sure
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:08.560] this
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:08.800] works.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:09.900] There's
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:10.120] still
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:10.420] a
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:10.620] lot
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:10.740] of
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:10.980] open
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.320] questions
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.560] here.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:12.220] How
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:12.300] do
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:12.420] you
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:12.660] actually
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:13.080] trade?
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.260] This
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:14.440] is
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:14.620] really
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:14.780] good
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:14.940] for
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:15.140] trade
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.580] execution,
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:16.040] but
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.280] what
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:16.440] about
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:16.840] discovery?
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:17.620] So
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:17.800] the
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:17.980] current
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.460] exchanges,
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.060] they're
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:19.260] not
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:19.980] just
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.060] put
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:21.180] all
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:21.280] your
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:21.460] money
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:21.640] in
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:21.800] here
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.360] and
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:22.600] then
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.080] ask
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:23.200] for
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:23.300] it
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:23.560] back.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:24.140] There's
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:24.320] that
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:24.540] middle
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:24.820] step,
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:25.020] where
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.440] you
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:25.800] find
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:25.960] all
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.060] the
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:26.220] other
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:26.560] parties.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:29.940] So
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:30.300] post
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:30.420] the
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:30.620] orders
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:30.780] on
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:30.880] the
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.220] blockchain,
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:31.860] and
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.960] maybe?
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:34.860] There's
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.160] problems.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:35.300] I
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:35.440] mean,
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:35.980] it's
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:36.180] not
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:36.440] too
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:36.680] crazy
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:36.820] of
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:36.880] an
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.020] idea,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:37.180] but
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:37.400] there's
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:37.540] some
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:37.800] problems
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.000] with
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.140] it.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.040] If
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:39.140] you
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:39.280] just
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:39.420] say,
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:39.620] hey,
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:39.880] I
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.060] want
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.180] to

[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:41.960] and
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.060] I
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:42.180] want
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:42.260] to
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:42.420] buy
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:42.820] Vertcoins,
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:43.140] and
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:43.280] you
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:43.660] put
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:43.880] that
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.000] in
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.100] an
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:44.260] op
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:44.460] return
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:44.680] on
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:44.760] the
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.080] blockchain,
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.040] well,
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:46.340] it's
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:46.540] non
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:46.860]-binding.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:47.400] You
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:47.500] don't
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:47.740] have
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:47.880] to
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.220] actually
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:48.480] do
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:48.860] anything.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:49.400] It
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:49.580] can
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:49.720] be
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:49.960] front
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.220] running,
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:50.580] where
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.580] the
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:51.980] orders
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.400] can
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.280] go
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:53.520] in
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.020] the
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:54.240] wrong
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:54.740] sequence
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:54.880] or
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.000] in
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.380] time.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:56.460] And
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:56.600] it's
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:56.760] not
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.140] scalable,
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.120] because
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:58.980] if
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.600] everyone's
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:37:59.880] posting
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.460] orders
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.780] on
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:01.920] the
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.200] blockchain,
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:02.420] that
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:02.540] can
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:02.680] take
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:02.780] up
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:02.860] a
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:02.960] lot
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:03.040] of
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:03.380] space,
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:04.700] probably
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:04.980] more
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.160] so
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:05.320] than
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:05.580] actual
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.060] transactions.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.280] I
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.420] don't
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:06.700] know
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.020] what,
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:08.020] I
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:08.120] mean,
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:08.240] I'm
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.420] sure
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:08.560] it
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:08.700] may
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:09.000] be,
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:09.860] like
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:10.680] total
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:10.980] number
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.140] of
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.560] orders
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.260] placed
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:12.520] on
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:12.760] a
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.040] order
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.300] book
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:13.620] versus
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.040] total
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.320] number
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:14.540] of
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:14.900] actual
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:15.200] order
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:15.800] executions.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:17.740] Usually,
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.100] there's
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:18.220] a
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:18.380] lot
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:18.600] more
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:18.920] orders
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.140] that
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:19.320] then
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:19.700] end
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:19.840] up
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.060] getting
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.480] canceled.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:21.420] Because
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:21.580] in
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:21.800] most
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.140] exchanges
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:22.360] that
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:22.520] I've
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:22.740] seen,
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:22.980] and
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.080] I
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:23.660] believe
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:23.860] this
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:23.940] is
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:24.040] the
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:24.240] case
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:24.400] in
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.280] regular
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:25.900] New
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.040] York
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.240] Stock
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:26.540] Exchange
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:26.740] kind
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:26.820] of
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.040] things,
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:27.600] you
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:27.700] can
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:27.840] say,
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:27.980] hey,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.120] I
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:28.260] want
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:28.360] to
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:28.500] sell
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:28.700] this
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:28.820] at
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:28.980] this
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.280] price.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.180] And
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:30.480] then
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.380] a
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:31.500] few
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:31.740] minutes
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:31.960] later,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:32.060] you
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.160] say,
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:32.300] yeah,
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:32.400] I
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:32.560] changed
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:32.700] my
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:32.900] mind.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.080] I
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:33.160] don't
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:33.280] want
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:33.340] to
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:33.460] sell
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:33.560] it
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:33.620] at
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:33.760] that
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:33.940] price
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:34.200] anymore.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:34.520] The
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:34.700] price
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:34.820] has
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.100] moved,
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:35.380] and
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:35.680] I've
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:35.840] changed
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:35.980] my
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.140] mind.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:36.940] And
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.100] a
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:37.220] lot
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:37.340] of
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:37.540] times,
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:37.880] yeah?
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:38.680] That
[00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:39.870] exchange
[00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:40.230] runs
[00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.610] about
[00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:41.150] 100
[00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.810] messages

[00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.330] trade.
[00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:43.730] OK,
[00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:44.190] so
[00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.630] about
[00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.930] 1
[00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:45.150]%
[00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.330] of
[00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:45.430] the
[00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.730] actual
[00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:46.370] trades
[00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.850] get
[00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:47.230] executed.
[00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.850] Yeah,
[00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:48.050] that
[00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.350] sounds
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:49.840] probably
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.120] about
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:50.420] the
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:50.680] same
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:50.840] as
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:50.980] in
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:51.100] a
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:51.180] lot
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:51.280] of
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:51.500] Bitcoin
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:51.940] exchanges.
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:53.560] Usually,
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:53.780] in
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:53.880] the
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.080] Bitcoin
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:54.400] exchanges,
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:54.600] they
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:54.820] don't
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.260] charge
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:55.620] you
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.520] to
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.940] post
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:58.100] an
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:58.740] order
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.000] and
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.160] then
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:38:59.380] take
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:38:59.480] it
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:38:59.740] back.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:00.740] That's
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:00.960] free.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:01.520] Whereas
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:01.780] the
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:01.940] trade
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.200] actually
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:02.640] executing,
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.000] usually,
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:03.140] they
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:03.260] have
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:03.400] some
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.560] kind
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:03.640] of
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:03.760] fee.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.200] So
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:06.640] posting
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:06.840] the
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.060] orders
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:07.400] themselves
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:07.680] on
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:07.760] the
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.200] blockchain
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.300] seems
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:09.460] like
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:09.560] a
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:09.700] cool
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:09.920] idea,
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:10.160] but
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.480] you've
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:11.640] gotten
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:11.780] out
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:11.880] of
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:11.980] the
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.420] scalability
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:12.780] problem
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:12.920] of
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.020] all
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:13.160] these
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:13.620] transactions.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:13.940] Now
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:14.060] it's
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:14.260] probably
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:14.460] 100
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:14.720] times
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.100] worse.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:16.740] And
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.200] front
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:17.480] running
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.120] could
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:18.300] also
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:18.480] be
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:18.700] tricky,
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:19.140] because
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.200] the
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:20.440] blockchain
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:20.700] does
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.100] provide
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:21.660] sequence
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.220] and
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:22.560] timing,
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.480] but
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:23.920] it's
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.040] up
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:24.140] to
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:24.280] the
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:24.480] miners.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:24.960] So
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:25.060] if
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:25.140] you
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:25.360] have
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:25.580] a
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:25.840] 10
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.060]-minute
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:26.540] window,
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:27.640] during
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:27.860] that
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.080] 10
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.240]-minute
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:28.540] window,
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:28.760] the
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:29.000] miners
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:29.200] can
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:29.560] basically
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:29.840] shuffle
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.120] things
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.360] around
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:30.600] however
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:30.760] they
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.000] want.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:32.800] And
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:32.940] so
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.060] if
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.160] the
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:33.320] miner
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:33.480] is
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:33.680] also
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.000] trading,
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:34.220] they
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:34.340] can
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:34.520] see,
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:34.680] oh,
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:34.800] I
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:34.940] see
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:35.060] all
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:35.200] these
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:35.400] different
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:35.700] orders.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:36.460] I
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:36.660] will
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.080] match
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:37.660] these
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:37.960] orders
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.560] and
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.360] let
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:39.640] those
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:39.920] happen
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.300] afterwards.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:41.400] So
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:41.580] this
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:41.700] is
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:41.800] an
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.120] issue.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:42.820] So
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.300] there's
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:43.580] a
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:43.820] bunch
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:43.960] of
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.200] different
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:44.520] models
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:44.860] people
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.000] are
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:45.180] looking
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.400] at.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:46.080] And
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.460] to
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:47.580] be
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:47.760] clear
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:47.900] here,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:48.180] this
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:48.340] is
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:48.660] not
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:49.120] something
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.420] that
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:49.780] really,
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.040] I
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:51.100] don't
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:51.180] want
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:51.240] to
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:51.320] say
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:51.400] it
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:51.600] doesn't
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:51.840] exist
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.020] yet.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:52.220] It
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:52.400] sort
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:52.520] of
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:52.720] does.
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.020] There
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.500] are
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.080] these
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:54.580] decentralized
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.200] exchanges
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.020] popping
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:56.400] up,
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.060] mostly
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:57.300] on
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:57.420] the
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:57.700] Ethereum
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.140] network
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:58.360] right
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:58.680] now,
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:39:59.700] because
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.000] then
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.260] it's
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:00.480] not
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:00.780] actually
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.120] cross
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:01.380]-chain.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:01.660] You
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:01.780] can
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:01.900] have
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:02.260] cross
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:02.900]-asset,
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:03.620] because
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:03.880] there's
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.020] all
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:04.280] these
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:04.700] ERC
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:04.920]-20
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.340] tokens.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.120] But
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:07.280] the
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:07.560] cross
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:07.840]-chain
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.120] swaps
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:08.440] themselves
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:08.700] are
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:08.800] a
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:08.880] bit
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.100] more
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:09.660] complicated
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:09.820] to
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.040] program.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:10.380] So
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:10.880] I
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.020] don't
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:11.380] know
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:11.560] of
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:11.860] any
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.460] live,
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:14.820] not
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.340] mainnet
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.100] operation
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:16.360] like
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:16.580] this.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:17.480] So
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:17.700] one
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:17.980] model
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.180] would
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:18.380] be
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:18.660] you
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:18.740] have
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:18.840] a
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.100] central
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:19.280] order
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:19.540] book
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:19.780] and
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:19.900] a
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:20.160] central
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:20.880] counterparty.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:21.520] So
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:21.700] the
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.060] exchange
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:22.320] says,
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:22.640] OK,
[00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.870] we're
[00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:24.090] still
[00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:24.270] the
[00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.710] exchange.
[00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:24.930] We
[00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:25.210] still
[00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:25.450] have
[00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:25.570] a
[00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:25.870] website.
[00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.370] We
[00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:26.630] still
[00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:27.010] have
[00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:28.330] buys
[00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:28.530] and
[00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:28.810] sells
[00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:28.990] and
[00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.150] stuff
[00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.310] like
[00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:29.590] that.
[00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:31.550] And
[00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.950] not
[00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:32.070] only
[00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:32.250] that,
[00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:32.430] but
[00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.590] the
[00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:32.970] exchange
[00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:33.230] is
[00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.490] one
[00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:33.770] side
[00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:33.910] of
[00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:34.150] every
[00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.450] trade.
[00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:35.170] So
[00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:35.330] they
[00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:35.510] say,
[00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:35.750] OK,
[00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:36.070] open
[00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:36.190] a
[00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.370] channel
[00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:36.610] with
[00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:36.870] us.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:37.940] Put
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:38.100] all
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:38.240] your
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:38.420] Vert
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:38.620] coins
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:38.820] in.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:38.980] Put
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.120] all
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:39.240] your
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:39.400] Doge
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:39.560] coins
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:39.740] in.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:40.100] And
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:40.260] then
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:40.440] we'll
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:40.680] open
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:40.800] a
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.000] different
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.260] channel
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:41.460] with
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:41.700] you.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.200] And
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:42.320] we'll
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:42.520] put
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:42.860] Litecoins
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.060] in
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:43.200] it.
[00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:44.430] And
[00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.910] you
[00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:45.550] trade
[00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:45.730] with
[00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:46.010] us.
[00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:46.830] But
[00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:46.990] then
[00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.130] what
[00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:47.270] they
[00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.390] can
[00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.610] do
[00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:47.810] is
[00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:47.910] they
[00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:48.010] can
[00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:48.130] say,
[00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:48.270] well,
[00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.410] we're
[00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:48.590] not
[00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:48.850] actually
[00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:49.010] going
[00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.130] to
[00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:49.550] trade
[00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.270] unless
[00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.130] there's
[00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:51.870] someone
[00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.190] else
[00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.650] performing
[00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:52.950] a
[00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:53.230] similar
[00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.910] opposite
[00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:54.250] trade.
[00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:55.210] And
[00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:55.310] then
[00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:55.430] they
[00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.550] can
[00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.770] keep
[00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:55.910] the
[00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:56.150] spread.
[00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.570] So
[00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:56.690] they
[00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.850] say,
[00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:57.010] OK,
[00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.350] we're
[00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:57.870] selling
[00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:58.130] Vert
[00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.350] coin
[00:40:58.350 --> 00:40:58.610] at
[00:40:58.610 --> 00:40:59.310] this
[00:40:59.310 --> 00:40:59.610] rate
[00:40:59.610 --> 00:40:59.870] and
[00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:00.450] buying
[00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:00.590] it
[00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:00.690] at
[00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:00.830] this
[00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:01.050] other
[00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:01.370] slightly
[00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.610] different
[00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:01.850] rate.
[00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:03.570] So
[00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:03.810] that
[00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:04.450] seems
[00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:04.710] the
[00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.990] most
[00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.670] feasible.
[00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.770] I
[00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:07.030] would
[00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.690] venture
[00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:07.930] that
[00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:08.210] that's
[00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.370] going
[00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:08.510] to
[00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:09.130] happen
[00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:09.630] first
[00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:10.110] because
[00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:10.390] it's
[00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.670] not
[00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.170] too
[00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:11.630] crazy.
[00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:13.490] But
[00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.570] it
[00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:13.710] has
[00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:14.010] similar
[00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:14.670] centralization
[00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.930] to
[00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:15.050] the
[00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.230] current
[00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.630] model.
[00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:16.570] But
[00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:16.830] there
[00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:16.990] is
[00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.230] less
[00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.750] counterparty
[00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.970] risk.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:18.740] So
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.000] if
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:19.320] you
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.060] are
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:20.420] worried
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:20.640] about
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:20.820] an
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.200] exchange
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:21.900] shutting
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.160] down
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:22.320] and
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:22.540] running
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:22.740] off
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:22.860] with
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:22.980] all
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.100] your
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:23.300] Doge
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:23.480] coin,
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.600] this
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:24.760] can
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.060] help.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:25.700] Say,
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:25.860] OK,
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.060] well,
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:26.140] I
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:26.220] have
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:26.320] a
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:26.580] channel
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:26.740] with
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:26.900] my
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:27.080] Doge
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:27.240] coin
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:27.400] in
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:27.520] it
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:27.600] and
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:27.720] a
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:27.940] channel
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:28.120] with
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.280] my
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:28.440] Vert
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:28.560] coin
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:28.780] in
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:28.920] it.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:29.480] And
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:29.580] I
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:29.700] can
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:29.880] sell
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.040] some
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:30.200] Doge
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:30.400] coin,
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:30.620] get
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:30.780] some
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:30.940] Vert
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:31.080] coin
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:31.240] from
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:31.380] the
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:31.720] exchange.
[00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.950] And
[00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:33.030] I
[00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.210] still
[00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:33.390] have
[00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.510] a
[00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.770] nice
[00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:34.070] order
[00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.190] book.
[00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:34.930] It
[00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:35.290] doesn't
[00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:35.710] solve
[00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:36.110] any
[00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:36.350] kind
[00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:36.590] of
[00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:36.930] front
[00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:37.110] running
[00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:37.450] problem.
[00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:37.690] The
[00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:37.990] exchange
[00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.230] can
[00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.530] still
[00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:38.910] order
[00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:39.170] things
[00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.290] how
[00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.390] they
[00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.630] want.
[00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:40.490] And
[00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:40.570] the
[00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:40.850] exchange
[00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:41.030] can
[00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.150] still
[00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.390] shut
[00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.730] down.
[00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:43.090] But
[00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:43.610] it's
[00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.150] much
[00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.410] more
[00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:44.690] difficult
[00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.930] for
[00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:45.030] the
[00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.270] exchange
[00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.430] to
[00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.670] somehow
[00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:46.010] steal
[00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.250] your
[00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.590] coins,
[00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:47.710] which
[00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:48.310] is
[00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:48.390] a
[00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.610] problem
[00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:48.870] now.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:50.720] Another
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.060] model,
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:51.880] you
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.040] say,
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:52.380] well,
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:52.900] we
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:53.020] have
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.140] a
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:53.400] central
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:53.760] order
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.040] book.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:54.360] So
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:54.520] the
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:54.980] exchange
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.300] still
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:55.840] exists
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.240] and
[00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:58.650] aggregates
[00:41:58.650 --> 00:41:58.790] all
[00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.910] the
[00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:59.210] orders
[00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.430] of
[00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.650] everyone
[00:41:59.650 --> 00:41:59.850] who
[00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:00.030] wants
[00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.190] to
[00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.410] buy
[00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.590] and
[00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:00.870] sell.
[00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:02.070] But
[00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:02.590] there's
[00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:02.930] multiple
[00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:03.870] counterparties
[00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:03.990] that
[00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.110] you
[00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:04.490] interact
[00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:04.650] with
[00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:04.990] directly.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.160] So
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:06.860] the
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.180] exchange
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:07.360] says,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:07.560] OK,
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:07.840] I'm
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.080] E.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:08.460] And
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:08.840] I
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.080] will
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:09.680] tell
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:09.980] Alice
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:10.340] about
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:10.640] Bob.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.260] Alice
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:11.480] says,
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:11.660] hey,
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:11.940] I
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:12.240] want
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:12.540] to
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.600] sell
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:13.820] Doge
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:13.960] coin
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:14.180] and
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:14.380] buy
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:14.600] Vert
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:14.800] coin
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.600] at
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:15.820] this
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.060] rate.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:17.400] And
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:17.520] then
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:17.640] the
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:17.980] exchange
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:18.340] tells
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:18.620] Alice
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:18.800] and
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:18.960] Bob,
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:19.300] OK,
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:19.820] you
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:20.020] guys
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:20.380] matched.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.060] Bob,
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:21.220] you
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:21.400] want
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:21.640] to
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.640] sell
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:22.900] Vert
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.120] coin.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:23.400] Alice,
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:23.540] you
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:23.640] want
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:23.720] to
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:23.900] buy
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:24.060] it.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:24.640] Here,
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.040] connect
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:25.220] to
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:25.400] each
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:25.660] other
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:26.620] and
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:26.960] perform
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.140] this
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:27.380] trade.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.020] This
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:29.400] is
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.100] cooler.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.060] But
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:31.340] there's
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:31.840] questions
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.120] in
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:32.300] that
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.000] if
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.140] you're
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:33.420] connecting
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:33.640] to
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:33.820] many
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:34.540] counterparties,
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.020] it's
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:35.360] costly.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.020] You
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.260] have
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:36.360] to
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:36.620] open
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.000] a
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:37.140] new
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:37.460] channel.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:37.720] And
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:37.900] that
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.160] is
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:38.320] on
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:38.540]-chain.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:39.400] Also,
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:39.580] how
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:39.660] do
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:39.800] you
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.280] enforce
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:40.600] trade
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.080] execution?
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.160] If
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:42.440] it's
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.080] a
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:43.380] trade
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:43.640] on
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:43.780] a
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.100] current
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.880] exchange,
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:46.440] and
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:46.520] you
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:46.660] say,
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:46.840] OK,
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:46.940] I
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.060] want
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:47.140] to
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:47.320] buy
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:47.720] bitcoins,
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:48.660] and
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:48.780] you
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.060] click,
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:49.580] OK,
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:49.700] it
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:49.840] just
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.160] happened.
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:50.980] They
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.160] aren't
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:51.360] even
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:51.540] your
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:51.880] bitcoins.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:52.060] You
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:52.220] don't
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:52.420] really
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:52.600] have
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:52.920] control
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.080] of
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:53.220] them.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:53.740] So
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:53.880] when
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.000] you
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.120] say
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:54.220] you
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:54.340] want
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:54.420] to
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:54.540] do
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:54.820] something,
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:55.360] they
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.080] actually
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:56.480] execute
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:56.680] it.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:57.460] In
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:57.680] this
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:57.940] case,
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:58.840] if
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.000] they
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.140] don't
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:42:59.300] have
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:42:59.420] a
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:42:59.620] channel
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:42:59.860] with
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:00.060] you,
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:00.880] they
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.120] just
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.420] are
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:01.980] observing
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.420] the
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:02.640] trade
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:02.920] occur.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:03.880] So
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.260] they're
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:04.720] saying,
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:04.940] OK,
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:05.860] Alice
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.040] and
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:06.180] Bob
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:06.340] do
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:06.700] this.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:08.380] It
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:08.500] might
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.160] not
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:09.300] even
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:09.480] be
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:09.800] possible
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.320] to
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.480] enforce.
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.080] You'd
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:12.200] have
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:12.280] to
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:12.400] have
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:12.520] some
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:12.720] kind
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:12.820] of
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:13.180] penalties
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:13.500] if
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:13.860] Bob
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.080] says,
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:14.320] hey,
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:14.880] Alice
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.120] said
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:15.300] she
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:15.620] was
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:15.860] going
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.040] to
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.260] sell,
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:16.440] but
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:16.620] then
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.280] didn't.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.360] Or
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:18.900] Bob
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:19.320] complains,
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:19.520] things
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:19.700] like
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:19.900] that.
[00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:23.330] So
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:24.220] there's
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:24.320] a
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:24.420] lot
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:24.520] of
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:24.780] ideas
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.020] here.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:25.680] Another
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.080] is,
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:26.320] OK,
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:26.460] if
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:26.980] you're
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.300] building
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.040] channels,
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:29.420] each
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:29.800] channel
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:29.960] that
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.060] you
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:30.320] build
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:30.660] has
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:30.880] these
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.060] on
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:31.180]-chain
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:31.540] costs
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:31.780] and
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:32.060] takes
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:32.380] quite
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:32.480] a
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:32.560] bit
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:32.680] of
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:32.920] time.
[00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.700] So
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.000] maybe
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:34.140] you
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:34.260] could
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:34.400] have
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:34.580] a
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:34.860] multi
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:35.160]-hop
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:35.800] network
[00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:37.010] from
[00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.370] different
[00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.690] coins.
[00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:38.170] So
[00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:38.430] instead
[00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.950] of
[00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:39.690] just
[00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:40.050] Alice,
[00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.270] Bob,
[00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:40.710] Alice,
[00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.450] you've
[00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.750] got
[00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:42.590] Dave
[00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:42.790] and
[00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:43.030] Carol,
[00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:43.430] and
[00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:44.290] as
[00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:44.510] long
[00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.650] as
[00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:44.830] I'm
[00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:45.150] connected
[00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.390] to
[00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.870] someone
[00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:46.190] in
[00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.430] this
[00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.830] network,
[00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.610] I
[00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:47.850] can
[00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:48.110] route
[00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:48.610] payments
[00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:49.190] to
[00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.530] them,
[00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:49.750] and
[00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.930] they
[00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:50.110] can
[00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:50.290] route
[00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:50.610] payments
[00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:50.810] to
[00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:51.010] me
[00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:51.250] via
[00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:51.570] different
[00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:51.890] channels.
[00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:52.530] So
[00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:52.750] I'm
[00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:53.050] connected
[00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:53.210] to
[00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.390] this
[00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.990] multi
[00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.550]-coin
[00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:55.130] network
[00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.470] kind
[00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.610] of
[00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:55.910] mesh.
[00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:56.570] That
[00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:56.670] would
[00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.770] be
[00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:56.970] really
[00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:57.290] cool.
[00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:00.510] It's
[00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:00.870] not
[00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:01.470] implemented.
[00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:02.450] It's
[00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:02.630] not
[00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.810] even
[00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:03.130] really
[00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:03.510] researched
[00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.730] that
[00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:03.870] well
[00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:04.030] yet.
[00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.190] So
[00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.390] these
[00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.810] are
[00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:04.990] sort
[00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.150] of
[00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.930] ideas.
[00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:07.570] But
[00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:07.710] that
[00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:07.830] would
[00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:07.910] be
[00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:08.090] really
[00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:08.250] cool,
[00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:08.430] then
[00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.550] you
[00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.750] wouldn't
[00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.990] need
[00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.130] as
[00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:09.290] much
[00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.630] liquidity.
[00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:09.910] So
[00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:10.130] one
[00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.210] of
[00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:10.470] the
[00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.810] issues
[00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:11.130] with
[00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:11.570] the
[00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:12.350] central
[00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.570] counterparty
[00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:13.730] model
[00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.870] is
[00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.970] the
[00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:14.270] exchange
[00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.490] still
[00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:14.670] needs
[00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:14.770] to
[00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:14.870] have
[00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.970] a
[00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:15.090] bunch
[00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:15.210] of
[00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:15.370] money.
[00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:16.050] They
[00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:16.190] still
[00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.330] need
[00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:16.430] to
[00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.590] have
[00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:16.690] a
[00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:16.850] bunch
[00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:16.970] of
[00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:17.330] Dogecoins
[00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:17.510] and
[00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.910] Vertcoins
[00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.590] in
[00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:18.790] order
[00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:19.030] to
[00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.190] be
[00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.330] a
[00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:19.870] counterparty
[00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.990] to
[00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.210] every
[00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:20.490] trade.
[00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:21.810] And
[00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:21.930] then
[00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:22.070] the
[00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:22.270] question
[00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.410] is,
[00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:22.530] well,
[00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:22.670] where
[00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.750] do
[00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.890] those
[00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:23.050] come
[00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:23.270] from?
[00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.630] And
[00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.850] if
[00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:25.450] you
[00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:25.610] say,
[00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:25.770] oh,
[00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.910] well,
[00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:26.010] it
[00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:26.250] comes
[00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:26.770] from
[00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:27.830] customers,
[00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:29.050] well,
[00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:29.390] now
[00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.750] that's
[00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:30.250] back
[00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:30.750] into
[00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:31.150] the
[00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.590] custodial
[00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:31.890] model,
[00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:32.190] where
[00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.350] they
[00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:32.610] still
[00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:32.910] have
[00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:33.350] coins
[00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:33.850] that
[00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:34.030] aren't
[00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.310] really
[00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:34.690] theirs.
[00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:37.190] You
[00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.290] can
[00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:37.450] say,
[00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:37.750] well,
[00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:38.030] they
[00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:39.230] probably,
[00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.570] and
[00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:39.690] what
[00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:39.890] I'm
[00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:40.150] guessing
[00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.350] is
[00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:40.490] going
[00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:40.590] to
[00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:40.850] happen
[00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:41.590] is
[00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:41.750] they're
[00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.850] going
[00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:41.910] to
[00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:42.050] say,
[00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:42.350] well,
[00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.930] we
[00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:43.190] charge
[00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.310] a
[00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:43.530] spread,
[00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.670] and
[00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:45.110] we'll
[00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:45.430] accept
[00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.930] investors.
[00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.870] And
[00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:47.130] so
[00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:47.530] if
[00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:47.630] you
[00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.770] want
[00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:47.870] to
[00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:48.270] invest
[00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.530] in
[00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:48.710] this
[00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:49.210] exchange,
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:50.640] give
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:50.720] us
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:50.820] a
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:50.960] bunch
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.040] of
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:51.400] Dogecoin,
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:51.680] give
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:51.780] us
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:51.880] a
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.020] bunch
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:52.140] of
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:52.520] Vertcoin.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:53.400] We
[00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:54.710] will
[00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:55.050] then
[00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:55.410] use
[00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:55.550] it
[00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.770] to
[00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:56.110] trade
[00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:56.330] with
[00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:56.670] different
[00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:57.070] parties,
[00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.450] and
[00:44:58.450 --> 00:44:58.630] then
[00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.830] we'll
[00:44:58.830 --> 00:44:59.050] keep
[00:44:59.050 --> 00:44:59.230] some
[00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.410] kind
[00:44:59.410 --> 00:44:59.470] of
[00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.770] spread,
[00:44:59.890 --> 00:44:59.990] and
[00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.150] then,
[00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:00.350] hey,
[00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:00.450] you
[00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:00.690] got
[00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:01.010] a
[00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.610] return
[00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:02.210] on
[00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.470] your
[00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.990] invested
[00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.490] Dogecoin.
[00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.730] You
[00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:03.870] get
[00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:04.070] more
[00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:04.410] Dogecoin
[00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:04.570] at
[00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:04.670] the
[00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.830] end,
[00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:05.210] and
[00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.310] then
[00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:05.390] you
[00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.550] can
[00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:05.850] withdraw
[00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:06.150] it.
[00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.870] I
[00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:08.090] think
[00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:08.290] this
[00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:08.390] is
[00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.570] still
[00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:08.910] better
[00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:09.130] than
[00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:09.270] the
[00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.450] current
[00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:09.710] model,
[00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:10.090] where
[00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:10.370] you
[00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:10.730] leave
[00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.870] a
[00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.970] whole
[00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:11.190] bunch
[00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.330] of
[00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:11.530] coins
[00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:11.710] on
[00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.810] the
[00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:12.010] exchange,
[00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.390] and
[00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.470] you
[00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.610] get
[00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:12.850] nothing.
[00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:14.970] Now
[00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:15.150] you
[00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.310] can
[00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:15.570] choose.
[00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:15.830] OK,
[00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:16.050] do
[00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:16.210] I
[00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:16.470] want
[00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.650] to
[00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:17.010] give
[00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:17.410] them
[00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:17.890] my
[00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:18.290] coins
[00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:18.670] and
[00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.890] take
[00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:19.090] that
[00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:19.550] counterparty
[00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.790] risk,
[00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:19.950] but
[00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.050] I
[00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:20.170] get
[00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:20.390] some
[00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.730] return
[00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:21.230] in
[00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.590] exchange
[00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:21.750] for
[00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.910] that
[00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:22.130] risk?
[00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.830] Or
[00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:22.970] do
[00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:23.070] I
[00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:23.230] just
[00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.370] want
[00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:23.450] to
[00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.650] trade
[00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:23.890] without
[00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:24.390] counterparty?
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:25.560] So
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.180] another
[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:27.800] problem
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:27.940] with
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:28.060] that
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:28.320] model,
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:28.560] but
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:29.640] it's
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:29.880] probably
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.040] what
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:30.120] will
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:30.300] happen.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.100] This
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:31.500] doesn't
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:31.700] have
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:31.900] that
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.200] issue
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:32.480] in
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:32.680] that
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.900] there
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:34.120] is
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:34.300] no
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:34.560] central
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:35.080] counterparty
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:35.220] who
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:35.420] needs
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:35.540] to
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:35.720] have
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:35.840] a
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:35.980] bunch
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:36.120] of
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.420] coins.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:36.880] I'm
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.100] trading
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:37.520] directly
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:37.740] with
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:37.840] the
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.000] people
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:38.480] who
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:38.740] own
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:38.860] the
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.080] coins
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:39.180] and
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:39.300] want
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:39.380] to
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:39.480] sell.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:39.840] Yeah?
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:40.320] My
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:40.560] question
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:40.720] is,
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:40.940] even
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:41.080] if
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:41.200] you
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:41.440] have
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:41.740] this
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.420] central
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:42.740] rope
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:43.080] and
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:43.720] multiple
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.620] counterparties,
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:45.040] would
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:45.260] there
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:45.720] still
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.100] be
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:46.400] these
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.900] trader
[00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:48.950] nodes
[00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:49.470] that
[00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.610] are
[00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:49.810] going
[00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:49.890] to
[00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:50.050] go
[00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:50.230] out
[00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.410] there
[00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:50.530] and
[00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:51.150] essentially
[00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.450] be
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:53.440] kind
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:53.480] of
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:53.620] the
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:53.760] same
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:53.980] thing?
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:54.180] Like,
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:54.340] they're
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:54.440] going
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:54.480] to
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:54.600] be
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:54.800] well
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.020]-funded.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:55.240] They're
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:55.360] going
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:55.420] to
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:55.840] take
[00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:57.190] fees
[00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.390] by
[00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:57.690] doing
[00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:57.950] all
[00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:58.090] these
[00:45:58.090 --> 00:45:58.310] different
[00:45:58.310 --> 00:45:58.790] transactions,
[00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:59.090] and
[00:45:59.090 --> 00:45:59.290] they're
[00:45:59.290 --> 00:45:59.410] going
[00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:00.230] to
[00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:01.050] get
[00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:01.290] bigger
[00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:01.410] and
[00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:01.610] bigger?
[00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:01.970] Yeah,
[00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:02.250] I
[00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:02.390] guess
[00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.550] the
[00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.710] only
[00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:03.090] distinction
[00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:03.410] is.
[00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:03.970] So
[00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:04.490] yes,
[00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.670] over
[00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:07.010] the
[00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:07.410] not
[00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:07.550] even
[00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.790] long
[00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:08.030] term,
[00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:08.490] medium
[00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:08.930] term,
[00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.970] these,
[00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:10.410] as
[00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:10.530] a
[00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:11.290] user
[00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:11.850] interface,
[00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:12.110] they
[00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:12.330] look
[00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:12.570] the
[00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:13.050] same,
[00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:13.290] right?
[00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:13.670] Because
[00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:14.350] whether
[00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:14.590] it's
[00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:14.710] the
[00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:15.110] exchange
[00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:15.430] itself
[00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.710] saying,
[00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:15.950] OK,
[00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.470] I'm
[00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.970] aggregating.
[00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.590] Everyone
[00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.030] deposit.
[00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:18.550] I've
[00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.650] got
[00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.750] a
[00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.850] ton
[00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:18.930] of
[00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:19.230] capital.
[00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.710] I'm
[00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:19.790] going
[00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.830] to
[00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:19.970] be
[00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:20.290] a
[00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:20.750] counterparty
[00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.810] of
[00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:20.910] these
[00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:21.150] trades
[00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.250] and
[00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:21.490] market
[00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:21.750] maker,
[00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.650] versus,
[00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:23.730] oh,
[00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:24.010] there's
[00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:24.310] no
[00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:24.890] defined
[00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:25.210] market
[00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:25.570] maker,
[00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.290] but
[00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:27.010] the
[00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:27.170] people
[00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:27.350] with
[00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:27.430] a
[00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.530] lot
[00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.630] of
[00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.870] money
[00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:28.070] or
[00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:28.250] who
[00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.430] are
[00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.690] really
[00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:28.930] trying
[00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:29.030] to
[00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.130] do
[00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:29.330] this
[00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:29.550] end
[00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:29.750] up
[00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.110] in
[00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:30.310] that
[00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:30.650] position.
[00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:31.370] I
[00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.670] guess
[00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.790] the
[00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.950] only
[00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:32.250] difference
[00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:32.530] is,
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:33.760] in
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:33.940] this
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.240] case,
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:34.920] the
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.480] counterparty
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:35.700] is
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.040] also
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:36.340] running
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:36.500] the
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:36.680] order
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:36.920] book.
[00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.790] And
[00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.930] in
[00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:38.110] this
[00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:38.390] case,
[00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.910] they
[00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:39.230] may
[00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.530] be
[00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.910] different,
[00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:40.250] right?
[00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.690] There's
[00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:41.090] an
[00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:41.370] order
[00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:41.590] book
[00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:41.910] server,
[00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:42.570] and
[00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:42.730] then
[00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:42.950] there's
[00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:43.110] this
[00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:43.310] big
[00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:43.830] counterparty
[00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:43.990] who
[00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.190] has
[00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.450] a
[00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.570] ton
[00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:44.670] of
[00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.870] money
[00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:45.110] who's
[00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:45.270] doing
[00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.410] all
[00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.510] the
[00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.710] trades.
[00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:47.770] So
[00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:48.210] does
[00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:48.450] that
[00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:49.270] difference?
[00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.550] Does
[00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.670] that
[00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.830] make
[00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:50.030] much
[00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.290] difference?
[00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.430] I
[00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.490] don't
[00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:50.610] know.
[00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.850] Yes?
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:51.760] For
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.300] markets,
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:52.660] the
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:52.900] second
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.320] example
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:53.560] is
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:53.660] the
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:53.840] one
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:53.960] that
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.060] you
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:54.220] see
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:54.540] more.
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:54.940] Right.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:55.160] Yeah,
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:55.500] right?
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:55.720] New
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:55.920] York
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.180] Stock
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:56.620] Exchange,

[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.260] Stock
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:57.560] Exchange.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:57.940] So
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.220] the
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:00.700] first
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.040] model
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:01.340] has
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:01.560] the
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.140] centralized
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:03.840] party
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.320] collecting
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:04.740] huge
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:05.200] economic
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.080] rents
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:06.460] because
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:06.680] they're
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.080] centralized,
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:08.060] which
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:08.200] is
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:08.360] kind
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:08.440] of
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:08.840] interesting.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:09.040] We're
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:09.260] big
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:09.480] ones,
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:09.720] so
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:09.780] it
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:09.840] should
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:10.000] be
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:10.500] decentralized.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:11.440] Yeah.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:13.580] Yeah,
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:13.760] so
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.020] this
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.120] probably
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:15.380] ends
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:15.580] up
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:16.380] with
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:16.620] a
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.280] small
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:17.620] number
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:17.900] of

[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:18.720] nodes,
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.840] mostly
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.100] because
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:20.240] the
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:20.640] efficiency,
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:20.920] right?
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:21.020] If
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:21.160] you're
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:21.460] connecting
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:21.800] to
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.440] 100
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:22.720] different
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.400] counterparties
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:23.880] and
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.000] you
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.240] never
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:24.500] actually
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:24.760] trade
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:24.900] with
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:25.100] any
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:25.280] of
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:25.480] them,
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.480] it's
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:26.700] very
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.060] costly
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:27.340] to
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:27.840] build
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.080] those
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.420] channels.
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:28.680] It
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.520] probably
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:29.780] has
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:30.320] analogies
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:30.500] to,
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:30.660] in
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:30.860] real
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:31.100] life,
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:31.660] it's
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:31.960] costly
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.140] to
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:32.500] maintain
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:32.980] these
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.340] relationships
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:34.680] with
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:34.820] all
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:34.960] these
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.180] different
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:35.540] companies
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:35.700] and
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:35.860] stuff.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.040] It's
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.260] much
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:36.500] more
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:36.760] efficient
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:36.920] if
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.000] we
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:37.180] just
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:37.780] all
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:38.000] meet
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:38.320] under
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:38.760] this
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.100] buttonwood
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:39.300] tree.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:41.900] It's
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:41.960] a
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:42.100] different
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:42.400] issue
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:42.700] in
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:42.860] that,
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.480] enforcing
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:43.700] trade
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:44.140] execution,
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:44.800] you
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:44.980] might
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:45.140] not
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:45.420] have
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.040] legal,
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:47.460] you
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:47.620] might
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:47.800] not
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.080] know
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:48.280] who
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:48.380] any
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:48.480] of
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:48.580] these
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:48.780] people
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:48.960] are
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.300] legally,
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:49.880] so
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:49.980] you
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.120] have
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:50.380] some
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:50.700] kind
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:50.920] of
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.400] penalties
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:51.780] or
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:51.960] some
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:52.160] kind
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:52.340] of
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:52.920] proofs
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.160] that
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:53.420] a

[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:53.880] occurred
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.120] the
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:54.400] correct
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:54.720] way,
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:55.220] things
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:55.380] like
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:55.680] that.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.320] Yeah?
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:57.320] So
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:57.320] I
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:57.440] just
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:57.540] want
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:57.620] to
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:57.720] say,
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.220] enforcing,
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:58.420] maybe
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:58.480] I
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:58.940] don't
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.860] fully
[00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:00.200] follow,
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:00.500] but
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.160] the
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:01.480] way
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.720] the
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:03.400] trades
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:03.560] are
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:03.860] set
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:04.120] up,
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:04.820] do
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.220] you
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:06.440] need
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:06.540] to
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:06.840] enforce
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:06.980] them?
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:07.100] Or
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:07.380] before
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:07.580] you
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:07.860] enter
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:08.060] into
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:08.240] them,
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:08.420] do
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:08.500] you
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:08.700] already
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:09.060] know
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.440] what
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:10.740] kind
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:10.840] of
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.000] scheme
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:11.200] it
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:11.200] is?
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:11.240] So
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:11.380] the
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:11.720] example
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.140] is,
[00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.330] Alice
[00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:18.490] goes
[00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:18.890] to
[00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:19.290] a
[00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:19.510] server,
[00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:19.790] right?
[00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:19.970] So
[00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:20.350] you
[00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:20.490] have
[00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:20.590] an
[00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:20.990] exchange.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:22.720] But
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:22.880] this
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.220] exchange
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:23.800] is
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.160] only
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:24.360] the
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:24.580] order
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:24.820] book,
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.120] right?
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:25.240] So
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:25.440] there's
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:25.500] a
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:25.680] little
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.080] buy
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:26.280] and
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:26.600] sell
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.040] kind
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:27.120] of
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:27.340] things.
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:27.780] And
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.260] then
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:28.580] Alice
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:28.860] says,
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:29.160] OK,
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:29.440] I
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:29.720] want
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:30.100] to
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.900] buy
[00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:33.810] VTC.
[00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.070] And
[00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:35.310] then
[00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:35.530] this
[00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:35.650] is
[00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:35.930] Alice.
[00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:36.550] Bob
[00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:36.910] says,
[00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:37.210] OK,
[00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:37.410] I
[00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:37.570] want
[00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:37.670] to
[00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:38.190] buy,
[00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:39.870] what
[00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:40.030] was
[00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.190] it,
[00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:40.870] Dogecoin.
[00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:43.970] Then
[00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:44.150] the
[00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.470] exchange
[00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.670] says,
[00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.870] oh,
[00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:45.050] you
[00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.250] guys
[00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:45.630] crossed,
[00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:46.030] right?
[00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:46.250] You
[00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:46.490] want
[00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.610] to
[00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:46.890] buy
[00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:47.350] Vertcoin
[00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:47.790] at
[00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.930] a
[00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:48.070] rate
[00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:48.270] that
[00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.510] he's
[00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:48.710] willing
[00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.890] to
[00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:49.090] sell
[00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:49.310] at,
[00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:49.570] or
[00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.030] slightly
[00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.390] higher,
[00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:50.530] or
[00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:50.750] whatever.
[00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:53.150] So
[00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.590] trade,
[00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.210] right?
[00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.330] So
[00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:54.470] the
[00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:55.010] exchange
[00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.330] tells
[00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:55.590] both
[00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:55.890] people,
[00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:56.190] hey,
[00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:56.410] you
[00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:56.790] matched.
[00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:57.550] Now
[00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:57.810] you
[00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:58.070] have
[00:48:58.070 --> 00:48:58.410] to
[00:48:58.410 --> 00:48:59.250] trade.
[00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.390] And
[00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.510] then
[00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:00.670] as
[00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.850] soon
[00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:01.030] as
[00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.230] A
[00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:01.610] sees,
[00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:02.090] oh,
[00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:02.250] you
[00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:02.550] matched,
[00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:02.690] you
[00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.770] have
[00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:02.850] to
[00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:03.050] trade,
[00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.370] Alice
[00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:03.750] disappears
[00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:04.630] and
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.100] says,
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:05.320] oh,
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:05.840] I
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.000] didn't
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:06.120] mean
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:06.340] to,
[00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.970] right?
[00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:08.330] So
[00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:09.410] the
[00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.950] exchange
[00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:10.410] only
[00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:10.670] can
[00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:11.050] provide
[00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:11.690] information.
[00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.670] They
[00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.970] can't
[00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:13.290] actually
[00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:13.830] force
[00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:14.110] Alice
[00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:14.270] and
[00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.450] Bob
[00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.610] to
[00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:14.890] do
[00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:15.050] the
[00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.330] trade,
[00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:16.230] is
[00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.330] the
[00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:16.590] problem.
[00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:20.810] In
[00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:21.370] broadcasting,
[00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:21.910] there's
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:23.640] information
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.020] for

[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:24.780] in
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:25.120] at
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:25.360] those.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:25.640] So
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:25.800] if
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:25.800] you
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:25.960] do
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:26.360] a,
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:27.260] if
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:27.400] it's
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:27.500] at
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:27.600] a
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:27.920] specific
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.420] price,
[00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:30.390] you're
[00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.630] actually
[00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:31.190] publishing
[00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.590] what
[00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:32.490] you
[00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:32.690] would
[00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:32.970] need
[00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:33.170] to
[00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.570] actually
[00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:33.850] keep
[00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:33.970] the
[00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:34.250] trade.
[00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:34.950] So
[00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:35.570] that,
[00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:35.830] yeah.
[00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.630] In

[00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.850] fill
[00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:01.970] it
[00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:02.370] without
[00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:03.270] additional
[00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.890] interactivity
[00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:04.130] from
[00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.430] Alice.
[00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:06.390] There
[00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.610] might
[00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:06.770] be,
[00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:07.030] I
[00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.250] think
[00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.470] there's
[00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.670] ways
[00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.810] to
[00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:07.910] do
[00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:08.070] that
[00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:08.190] in
[00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:08.490] Ethereum
[00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:09.550] for
[00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:09.930] Ethereum
[00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:10.270] tokens.
[00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.730] And
[00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:11.130] there
[00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:11.330] are
[00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:11.790] people
[00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:11.970] who
[00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:12.090] have
[00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:12.230] written
[00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.550] software
[00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:12.790] like
[00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:13.050] that.
[00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:13.950] But
[00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:14.090] in
[00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:14.190] the
[00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.410] Bitcoin
[00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:14.810] model,
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:16.340] there
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:16.460] might
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:16.580] be
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:16.640] a
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:16.700] way
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:16.780] to
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:16.900] do
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.020] it.
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:17.320] We
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:17.500] haven't
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:17.680] figured
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:17.840] it
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.000] out.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.340] So
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:20.860] it's
[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:20.980] sort
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:21.340] of,
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.080] you
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:22.280] put
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:22.380] in
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:22.500] your
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:22.780] orders,
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:23.360] they
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:23.740] return
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:23.920] and
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.020] say,
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:24.300] OK,
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:24.780] trade.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:25.140] And
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:25.600] now,
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:27.820] yeah,
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:28.060] now
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:28.180] they
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:28.320] have
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:28.460] to
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:28.760] continue
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:28.940] to
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:29.320] interact.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:29.580] So
[00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:30.300] it's
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:30.600] pretty
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.100] straightforward
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:31.360] for
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:31.660] Bob
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:31.880] or
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.560] Alice
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:32.720] to
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:32.900] just
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:33.260] unplug
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:33.380] her
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:33.640] computer
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:33.840] right
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:33.940] at
[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:34.080] that
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:34.260] point.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:35.720] And
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:35.980] that
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:36.760] introduces
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.300] timing
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:37.840] sort
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.000] of
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:38.300] issues
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:38.700] where
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:39.900] Alice
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:40.180] just
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:40.820] puts
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:40.980] in
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:41.140] all
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:41.420] these
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:41.900] fake
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:42.320] trades.
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:43.380] Maybe
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:43.600] they're
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:43.780] kind
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:43.980] of
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.380] out
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:44.660] there.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:45.380] But
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:45.740] sometimes
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:45.940] the
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:46.120] market
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:46.460] moves
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:46.720] during
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:46.900] the
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:47.220] time
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:47.580] between
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:48.440] I
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:48.640] put
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:48.840] my
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.100] trade
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:49.320] in
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:49.880] and
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.720] the
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.300] execution
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:51.680] comes
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:51.980] back.
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:52.800] And
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.000] so
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:53.200] I
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.040] unplug
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:54.380] most
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:54.540] of
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:54.640] them.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:54.920] I
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:55.360] ignore
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:55.660] most
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:55.780] of
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:55.880] them.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.020] But
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:56.120] the
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:56.280] ones
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:56.400] that
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:56.480] are
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:56.820] beneficial,
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:57.100] I
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:57.300] actually
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:57.440] go
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:57.600] through
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:57.780] with.
[00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:01.490] Well,
[00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:02.230] yeah.
[00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:04.190] So
[00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.670] yeah,
[00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.930] so
[00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:05.310] it's,
[00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:05.570] I
[00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:05.770] don't,
[00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:06.110] yeah.
[00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.470] The
[00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.890] difference
[00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:07.070] is
[00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:07.270] you're
[00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.470] saying
[00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:07.670] these
[00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.770] are
[00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:08.050] not
[00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:08.450] live
[00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.810] hot
[00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:09.130] bids
[00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:09.290] and
[00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.570] hot
[00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:09.950] offers,
[00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.410] meaning
[00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:11.690] executable.
[00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.490] They
[00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.730] had
[00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:14.490] another
[00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:14.950] step
[00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:15.290] where
[00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:15.470] they're
[00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:16.110] executable.
[00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:16.890] So
[00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:17.830] this
[00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:17.950] is
[00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:18.090] a
[00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:18.270] new
[00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.570] form
[00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:18.750] of
[00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:19.350] spoofing.
[00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:19.790] This
[00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:20.210] spoofing
[00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.410] goes
[00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:20.630] on
[00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.770] in
[00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:21.110] the
[00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:21.670] US
[00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:22.450] swaps
[00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:22.770] market
[00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:22.970] all
[00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:23.090] the
[00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:23.490] time
[00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:24.210] because
[00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:24.350] they're
[00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:24.510] not
[00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.890] live
[00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:25.330] bids
[00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:25.490] and
[00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.850] offers.
[00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:26.870] But
[00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:27.350] in
[00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:27.490] the
[00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:27.730] market
[00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:27.930] where
[00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:28.110] there's
[00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:28.810] executable
[00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:29.110] bids
[00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:29.290] and
[00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:29.710] offers,
[00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:30.650] that's
[00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.790] the
[00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:31.250] distinction.
[00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:32.010] This
[00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:32.130] is
[00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:32.290] not
[00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:32.690] hot.
[00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:33.490] It's
[00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:33.970] usually
[00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:34.530] canceled.
[00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:36.010] Right,
[00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.350] I
[00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:36.530] guess
[00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.830] so
[00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:37.190] hot
[00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.350] in
[00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:37.510] this
[00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.710] case
[00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:37.870] would
[00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:38.370] be
[00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:38.690] if
[00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:39.250] Bob
[00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:40.230] gets,
[00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.890] if
[00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.390] Alice's
[00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.750] offer
[00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:43.390] contains
[00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.770] all
[00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:43.950] the
[00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:44.430] information
[00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.870] needed
[00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:45.130] by
[00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:45.470] Bob
[00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.630] to
[00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:45.990] execute
[00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.230] the
[00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.570] trade,
[00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:47.090] then
[00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:47.170] it
[00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:47.270] would
[00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.450] be
[00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.590] sort
[00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:47.710] of
[00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.910] hot
[00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:48.050] in
[00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:48.210] that
[00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:48.470] sense.
[00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:48.570] And
[00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:48.710] that
[00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.890] Bob
[00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:49.250] doesn't
[00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.450] have
[00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:49.610] to
[00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:50.050] interact
[00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:50.270] with
[00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.450] Alice
[00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.810] anymore
[00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:51.250] to
[00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:51.730] execute.
[00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:53.230] With
[00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.430] these
[00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.850] construction,
[00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.250] with
[00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:54.550] the
[00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:55.030] cross
[00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.250]-chain
[00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.730] swaps
[00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:56.210] using
[00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.430] these
[00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:56.810] channels,
[00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.850] you
[00:51:57.850 --> 00:51:58.090] still
[00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:58.250] have
[00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.350] to
[00:51:58.350 --> 00:51:58.530] talk
[00:51:58.530 --> 00:51:58.650] to
[00:51:58.650 --> 00:51:58.790] each
[00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:59.030] other.
[00:51:59.550 --> 00:51:59.950] Bob
[00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:00.150] needs
[00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.330] to,
[00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.030] Alice,
[00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:01.390] Bob
[00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:01.910] generates,
[00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:02.130] no,
[00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.490] Alice
[00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:02.870] generates
[00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:03.030] the
[00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.170] r
[00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.470] value,
[00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:03.790] shares
[00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:03.950] the
[00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:04.130] hash
[00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.290] with
[00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:04.590] Bob.
[00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:05.250] They're
[00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:05.510] talking
[00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.630] to
[00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.770] each
[00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:05.970] other.
[00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:06.990] So
[00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.090] we
[00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:07.250] don't
[00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.650] know.
[00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:08.130] If
[00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:08.390] someone
[00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.670] figures
[00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:08.850] out
[00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:08.950] a
[00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:09.070] cool
[00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:09.210] way
[00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:09.330] to
[00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:09.430] do
[00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.610] it,
[00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.370] then
[00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:10.790] great.
[00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:11.030] That
[00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.130] will
[00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:11.330] solve
[00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:11.490] this
[00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:11.690] issue.
[00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:13.370] But
[00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.770] yeah.
[00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:14.450] Is
[00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:15.310] 0x
[00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:15.930] and
[00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:17.070] radar
[00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:17.530] relay,
[00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:18.070] are
[00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:18.250] they
[00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:18.610] hot?
[00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:19.550] I
[00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:19.750] believe
[00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:20.330] 0x
[00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:21.170] is,
[00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:21.710] from
[00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.950] what
[00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:22.230] I've
[00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.370] read.
[00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.530] I
[00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:23.010] don't
[00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:23.290] know
[00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:23.470] about
[00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:23.650] how
[00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:23.950] radar
[00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:26.950] relay
[00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:27.330] works.
[00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.750] But
[00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:28.170] 0x,
[00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.310] yeah,
[00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.750] you
[00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:30.710] basically,
[00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.390] your
[00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.770] order
[00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:32.410] is
[00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:32.970] executable
[00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:33.190] by
[00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.410] any
[00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.690] party
[00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:34.390] without
[00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.870] further
[00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:35.530] input
[00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:35.730] from
[00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:35.910] you.
[00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:37.630] But
[00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:37.750] it
[00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.950] also
[00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:38.230] has
[00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.550] scaling
[00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:38.830] issues.
[00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.190] So
[00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.750] that's
[00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.810] a
[00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:39.930] good
[00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:40.150] segue
[00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.370] to
[00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.490] the
[00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.670] next
[00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.930] part,
[00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:41.610] which
[00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:41.930] is
[00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:42.630] having
[00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.890] some
[00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:43.110] kind
[00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:43.250] of
[00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:43.650] distributed
[00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:44.010] order
[00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:44.250] book,
[00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:44.490] where
[00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:44.930] there
[00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:45.210] is
[00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:45.410] no
[00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.730] central
[00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:45.970] order
[00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:46.290] book.
[00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.910] There
[00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:47.130] is
[00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:47.330] no
[00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:47.610] central
[00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:48.250] counterparty.
[00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:48.670] The
[00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:48.930] whole
[00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:49.210] thing
[00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:49.350] is
[00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:49.450] a
[00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:49.690] big
[00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:50.330] mesh
[00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:50.890] network
[00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:51.090] kind
[00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:51.190] of
[00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.410] thing.
[00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:52.090] That
[00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:52.250] would
[00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:52.510] be
[00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.830] really
[00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:53.210] cool.
[00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:53.890] That
[00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:54.150] seems
[00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.370] the
[00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:54.710] furthest
[00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.990] out
[00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.290] in
[00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:55.550] terms
[00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:55.890] of,
[00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:56.550] how
[00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:56.650] do
[00:52:56.650 --> 00:52:56.710] you
[00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.830] do
[00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:57.170] this?
[00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.730] I
[00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:57.890] mean,
[00:52:57.970 --> 00:52:58.270] people
[00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:58.390] are
[00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.630] working
[00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.810] on
[00:52:58.810 --> 00:52:58.910] it.
[00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.170] But
[00:52:59.170 --> 00:52:59.770] it
[00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:00.210] seems
[00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:00.830] hard
[00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:01.010] to
[00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.190] make
[00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.650] practical
[00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:02.110] in
[00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:02.270] that,
[00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:02.410] how
[00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:02.510] do
[00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.590] you
[00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:02.810] ensure
[00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:03.190] fairness?
[00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.510] Who's
[00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.990] ordering
[00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.290] these
[00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:05.570] things?
[00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:06.110] And
[00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:06.190] you
[00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.290] could
[00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.430] say,
[00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.550] well,
[00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:06.690] the
[00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:06.970] blockchain
[00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:07.170] is
[00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:07.410] ordering
[00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:07.990] these
[00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.250] things.
[00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:08.450] But
[00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.690] that
[00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:09.070] ends
[00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:09.270] up
[00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.450] being
[00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:09.610] that
[00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:09.790] the
[00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:10.110] miners
[00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:10.430] order
[00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.670] it.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:11.530] So
[00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:11.910] if
[00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:13.390] Alice
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:13.600] is
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:13.820] buy
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:14.320] Vertcoin,
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:14.700] she's
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:14.860] like,
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:15.080] OK,
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:15.240] I'm
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:15.460] buying
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:15.800] Vertcoin
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:15.980] at
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:16.080] a
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:16.280] price
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:16.520] of
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.020] 5.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:18.260] And
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:18.400] then
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:18.560] he
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:18.760] says,
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:18.960] OK,
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:19.160] I'll
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:19.380] buy
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:19.740] Doge
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:19.920] at
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.040] a
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:20.280] price
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:20.560] of
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:21.780] whatever.
[00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:22.910] Basically,
[00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.190] you
[00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.690] cross.
[00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.910] And
[00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:24.030] you
[00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.170] have
[00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.290] an
[00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.490] order
[00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:25.370] where
[00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.670] there's
[00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.930] some
[00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:26.190] kind
[00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.450] of
[00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.970] overlap.
[00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:28.190] The
[00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.450] miner
[00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:28.690] can
[00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:28.850] say,
[00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:29.070] OK,
[00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:29.250] well,
[00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:29.510] I'll
[00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.850] instead
[00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:30.330] ignore
[00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:30.610] this
[00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:30.890] order,
[00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:31.630] execute
[00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.870] my
[00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:32.210] own,
[00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:33.090] and
[00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:33.270] then
[00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.730] execute
[00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:34.290] with
[00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:34.510] this
[00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.750] guy
[00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:35.930] and
[00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:36.170] take
[00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.330] the
[00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:36.570] spread.
[00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:37.870] Because
[00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:38.070] the
[00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:38.290] miner
[00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:38.710] really
[00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.950] gets
[00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:39.130] to
[00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:39.470] sequence
[00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.890] things
[00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:40.170] however
[00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:40.350] they
[00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:40.590] want.
[00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:41.330] The
[00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:41.610] blockchain
[00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:41.970] does
[00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:42.530] provide
[00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:43.730] ordering,
[00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:44.030] but
[00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.150] at
[00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.270] the
[00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.470] block
[00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.710] level.
[00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:45.350] Within
[00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:45.530] a
[00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:45.810] block,
[00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:46.090] it's
[00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:46.290] totally
[00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:46.450] up
[00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:46.530] to
[00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:46.590] the
[00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:46.770] miner.
[00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:47.490] So
[00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:47.630] the
[00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.830] miners
[00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:48.110] could
[00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:48.930] swap
[00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:49.150] things
[00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.450] around.
[00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.950] But
[00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:51.110] yeah,
[00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.290] how
[00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:51.370] do
[00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:51.450] you
[00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:51.650] ensure
[00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.990] fairness
[00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.290] in
[00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:52.510] terms
[00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:52.710] of
[00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:53.030] timing?
[00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:53.510] How
[00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.610] do
[00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:53.710] you
[00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:54.250] enforce
[00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:54.530] trade
[00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.950] execution?
[00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.970] And
[00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:56.310] probably
[00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:56.530] the
[00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:56.970] biggest
[00:53:56.970 --> 00:53:57.390] for
[00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.530] a
[00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:57.830] distributed
[00:53:57.830 --> 00:53:58.070] order
[00:53:58.070 --> 00:53:58.290] book
[00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:58.490] is
[00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.690] just
[00:53:58.690 --> 00:53:59.250] the
[00:53:59.250 --> 00:53:59.810] scalability
[00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:00.010] of
[00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:00.110] the
[00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:00.350] orders.
[00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:01.330] You
[00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:01.970] probably
[00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:02.490] don't
[00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:02.830] want
[00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:03.090] to
[00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:03.330] put
[00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:03.610] all
[00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:03.750] the
[00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:04.010] orders
[00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:04.210] on
[00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:04.310] a
[00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:04.570] blockchain.
[00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:05.550] Because
[00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:06.010] it
[00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:06.250] just
[00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:06.510] ends
[00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.630] up
[00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.770] being
[00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:07.010] a
[00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.130] ton
[00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.230] of
[00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.430] data.
[00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:09.030] So
[00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.630] you
[00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.850] have
[00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:09.970] to
[00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:10.130] have
[00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.310] some
[00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:10.530] kind
[00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:10.770] of
[00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:11.690] broadcast
[00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:12.270] network
[00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:13.050] where
[00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:13.290] you've
[00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:13.430] got
[00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.610] these
[00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:13.890] orders.
[00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:14.570] They
[00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:15.050] probably
[00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:15.550] should
[00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:15.730] have
[00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:15.930] some
[00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:16.070] way
[00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:16.250] to
[00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:16.690] expire.
[00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.910] But
[00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:18.090] an
[00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:18.670] expiry
[00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.990] is
[00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.190] also
[00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.370] an
[00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:19.630] issue
[00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.930] in
[00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:20.270] that
[00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:22.090] how
[00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:22.670] do
[00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.850] you
[00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:23.070] make,
[00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:23.330] how
[00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:23.430] do
[00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.550] you
[00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:23.970] ensure
[00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:24.430] that,
[00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:24.950] hey,
[00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.150] I'm
[00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.570] canceling
[00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:25.730] this
[00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.930] order.
[00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.370] How
[00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:26.470] do
[00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.550] you
[00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:26.730] ensure
[00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:26.870] that
[00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.990] the
[00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.350] cancellation
[00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:27.870] actually
[00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:28.430] propagates?
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.160] If
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:30.600] someone
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:30.800] can
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.040] say,
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:31.280] OK,
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:31.500] I've
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:31.680] got
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.160] pretty
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:32.320] good
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:32.600] control
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:32.720] of
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:32.780] the
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.100] network.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:33.620] And
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:33.740] I
[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:33.900] can
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:34.140] just
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.060] block
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:35.400] these
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:35.700] order
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:36.420] cancellations
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:36.660] and
[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:36.980] wait
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:37.240] and
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:37.580] then
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:38.480] execute.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:39.220] So
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:39.520] this
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:39.700] is
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:39.920] sort
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.080] of,
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:40.680] there's
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.020] papers,
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:41.880] there's
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.300] ideas,
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:43.100] but
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.060] it's
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:44.680] kind
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:44.760] of
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:44.900] out
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:45.080] there.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:48.240] So
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:48.520] that's
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:48.940] basically,
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:49.780] that
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:49.960] was
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:50.140] it,
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:51.600] a
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:51.780] little
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.560] earlier.
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:52.820] But
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:52.960] yeah,
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:53.140] this
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:53.260] is
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:53.680] basically
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.540] the
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:55.180] stuff
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:55.300] for
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:55.560] today.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:56.920] The
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:57.180] idea
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:57.620] works,
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:57.980] the
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:58.220] cross
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:58.340]-chain
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:58.620] swaps.
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:58.900] But
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:54:59.140] there's
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:54:59.420] still
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:54:59.760] a
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.000] lot
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:00.140] of
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:00.500] issues
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:00.960] in
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.280] terms
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:01.500] of,
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:01.680] OK,
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:01.880] how
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:02.000] do
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.100] you
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:02.320] actually
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:02.480] get
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:02.620] these
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:02.760] to
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:02.920] work?
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:03.900] How
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:04.020] do
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:04.140] you
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:04.480] build
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:04.680] a
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:04.960] scalable
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:05.660] trading
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:06.100] platform?
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:06.800] And
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:06.940] there
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:07.420] aren't
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:07.660] really
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:07.880] any
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:08.140] yet.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:08.500] There
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:08.680] are
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.020] some
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.060] things
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:10.180] on
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:10.440] Ethereum
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.040] that
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:11.340] work
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:11.660] OK.
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:12.580] The
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:12.800] fees
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:12.960] end
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:13.080] up
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:13.260] being
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:13.440] kind
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:13.520] of
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:13.740] high.
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:14.540] And
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:14.700] it's
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:14.880] also
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.300] Ethereum,
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:15.620] where
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:16.380] it's
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:16.560] not
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.040] between
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:17.420] different
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:17.920] blockchains.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:18.660] It's
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:18.840] all
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:19.060] running
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:19.220] on
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:19.340] the
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:19.600] Ethereum
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:19.960] network.
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:20.140] And
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:20.260] the
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:20.500] Ethereum
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:20.840] network
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.380] allows
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:21.620] you
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:21.860] to
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.260] specify,
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:22.980] well,
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:23.280] this
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:23.440] is
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:23.760] actually
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.060] something
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:24.320] else.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:24.560] This
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:24.680] is
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:24.800] an
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:24.960] ether.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:25.980] You
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:26.140] can
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:26.280] do
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:26.440] that
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:26.580] in
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:26.820] Bitcoin.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.160] So
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:28.480] there
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:28.660] are
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:29.200] protocols
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:29.400] in
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:29.620] Bitcoin
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:30.040] like
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.740] Omni
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:32.400] and
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.140] MasterCoin
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:33.280] and
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:33.460] things
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:33.620] where
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:33.740] you
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:33.860] could
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:34.000] sort
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.120] of
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:34.400] create
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:34.760] different
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.240] assets
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:36.340] by
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:36.580] using
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:36.820] op
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:37.160]-return.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:37.860] And
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.040] basically,
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:39.300] all
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:39.400] of
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:39.580] those
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:39.720] have
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:39.900] moved
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:40.040] to
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:40.340] Ethereum
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:40.580] now,
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:40.900] because
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.100] Ethereum's
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:42.920] a
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:43.100] much
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:43.400] nicer
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:43.780] design
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:43.920] for
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.140] those
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:44.440] things.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:44.820] And
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.020] most
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:45.120] of
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:45.200] the
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:45.440] Bitcoin
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:45.860] developers
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:46.040] are
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:46.180] sort
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:46.220] of
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:46.360] like,
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:46.560] great,
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:47.180] now
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:47.520] all
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:47.820] these
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:48.640] non
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:49.020]-Bitcoin
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:49.600] transaction
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.180] data
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.420] have
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:51.740] left.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:52.720] And
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:52.980] Bitcoin
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.160] is
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:53.340] just
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:53.620] focused
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:53.800] on
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:54.000] moving
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:54.300] Bitcoin
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:54.540] around.
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:55.640] Yeah,
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:55.820] so
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:55.920] the
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.060] basic
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:56.220] idea
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:56.600] works.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.220] There's
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:57.380] still
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:57.540] a
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:57.620] lot
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:57.740] of
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:58.060] unsolved
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:58.500] questions,
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.120] further
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:55:59.500] research
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:55:59.840] required,
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.080] which
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:00.260] is
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:00.580] great
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:00.740] to
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:00.960] hear
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.260] when
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:01.480] you're
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:01.700] a
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:01.980] researcher.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:03.940] And
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:04.140] there's
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:04.340] people
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:04.600] working
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:04.760] on
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:04.900] this
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:05.100] here.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:05.760] I'm
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:05.960] working
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:06.180] with
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:06.520] a
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:06.780] MN
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.060] student
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:07.560] on
[00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:07.820] cross
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:07.940]-chain
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:08.320] swaps
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:08.900] this
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:09.180] semester.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:09.640] There's
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:09.860] other
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:10.140] people
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:10.400] working
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:10.580] on
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:10.720] all
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:10.920] sorts
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:11.140] of
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:11.580] decentralized
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:12.000] exchange
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:12.440] things.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:13.360] Neha's
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:13.560] also
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:13.840] very
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:14.100] interested
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:14.340] in
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:14.440] it.
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:14.580] So
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:14.720] if
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:14.940] you
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:15.700] want
[00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:15.900] to
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:16.480] work
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:16.620] with
[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:16.880] Neha,
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:17.500] that's
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:17.580] a
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:17.800] chance.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:19.800] And
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.080] yeah,
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:20.220] I
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:20.380] think
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:20.580] it'll
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:20.700] be
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:20.940] big,
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.260] because
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:21.640] if
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:21.760] you
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.280] look
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:22.360] at
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:22.500] these
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:22.920] exchanges,
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:23.720] there's
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:23.860] a
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:24.120] lot
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:24.340] of
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.540] profit.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:26.160] So
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:26.440] like,
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:27.300] I
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:27.380] don't
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:27.600] know,
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:27.820] a
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:27.920] year
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.040] or
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:28.120] two
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:28.340] ago,
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:28.500] you
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:28.640] look
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:28.720] at
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.440] Poloniex.
[00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:29.900] They
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:29.980] were
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:30.200] making
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:30.360] like
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:30.440] a
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:30.600] million
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:30.880] dollars
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.000] a
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:31.220] day.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:32.400] Just
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:32.920] there's
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:33.080] so
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:33.260] much
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:33.680] volume.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.000] And
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:34.460] they
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:34.680] have
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.320] very
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:35.520] few
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.100] employees.
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:38.260] So
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:38.860] and
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:39.200] they're
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:39.400] like,
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:39.820] I
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.240] think
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:40.480] that
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:40.720] the
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:40.960] market
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.220] is
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:41.560] getting
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:41.840] sort
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:41.980] of
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:42.480] more
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.080] established
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:43.460] now
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:43.620] in
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:43.780] terms
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:43.900] of
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.040] it's
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.140] going
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:44.180] to
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:44.300] be
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:44.520] larger
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:44.980] players
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:45.520] and
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:45.980] stuff
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:46.120] like
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:46.300] that.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:46.480] But
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:46.620] it
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:46.760] was
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:46.980] pretty
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:47.360] much
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:47.740] like
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:48.000] Wild
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:48.200] Wild
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:48.460] West
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:48.600] a
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:48.700] few
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:48.880] years
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.120] ago,
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:49.760] where
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:49.920] it's
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.060] like,
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:50.240] I'm
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:50.340] going
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:50.360] to
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:50.500] open
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:50.620] an
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:50.920] exchange,
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:51.720] and
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:52.760] I
[00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:52.890] don't
[00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:53.030] even
[00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.170] need
[00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:53.250] a
[00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:53.410] bank
[00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:53.710] account.
[00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:55.010] The
[00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:55.410] big
[00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:55.810] exchanges
[00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:56.050] that
[00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:56.270] have
[00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.510] bank
[00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.890] accounts,
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:57.700] I
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:58.020] feel
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:58.160] like,
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:58.300] are
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:56:58.620] less
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.040] profitable.
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:56:59.940] So
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:00.120] like,
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:00.420] Coinbase
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:00.900] makes
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:01.040] a
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:01.140] lot
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:01.260] of
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:01.520] revenue,
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:01.780] but
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:01.960] they
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.280] have
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:02.620] a
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:02.760] lot
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:02.920] of
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.260] fees.
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:03.640] A
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.300] lot
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:04.400] of
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:04.760] costs.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:05.220] They
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:05.320] have
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:05.440] a
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:05.560] ton
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:05.660] of
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.120] employees.
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:06.640] They
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:06.700] have
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:06.780] a
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:06.840] ton
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:06.980] of
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:07.320] lawyers.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.240] They
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:08.400] have
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:08.500] to
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:08.680] worry
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:08.880] about
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.380] banks.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:10.520] Whereas
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:10.700] if
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:10.860] you're
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.060] like
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:11.460] Poloniex,
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:11.620] well,
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.060] Poloniex
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:12.200] is
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:12.480] now,
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.160] it
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:14.320] lasted
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:14.520] for
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:14.680] like
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:14.740] a
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:14.860] year
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:14.940] or
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:15.040] two,
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:15.180] where
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:15.280] they
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:15.380] could
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:15.480] do
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:15.680] that.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:17.520] But
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:17.620] if
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:17.720] you're
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:17.820] just
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:18.000] some
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:18.300] random
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:18.740] altcoin
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:19.140] exchange,
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:19.780] you
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:19.980] don't
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:20.260] need
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:20.360] a
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:20.520] bank
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:20.800] account.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:21.160] You
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:21.340] say,
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:21.580] look,
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:22.540] I'm
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:22.640] an
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:22.940] exchange
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:23.140] where
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:23.260] you
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:23.380] can
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:23.560] trade
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:23.940] Dogecoin
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:24.080] and
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:24.360] Vertcoin,
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:24.700] and
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:24.900] that's
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.080] it.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:26.680] There's
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:26.800] no
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.100] dollars
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:27.460] involved.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:28.260] So
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:28.720] those
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:28.920] kind
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.000] of
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:29.260] places,
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:29.520] they
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:29.660] can
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:29.900] open

[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:31.720] the

[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:33.420] They
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:33.860] don't
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:34.100] even

[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:34.520] be
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:34.920] companies.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:35.280] They
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:35.440] can
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:35.600] just
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:35.980] be
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:36.780] someone's
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.020] server.
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:40.020] And
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:40.480] the
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.500] fact
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:41.640] that
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:41.740] they

[00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:42.240] custody
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:42.540] means

[00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.630] Cryptsy

[00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:52.710] wallet
[00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.990] as
[00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:53.670] one
[00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.830] of
[00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:53.910] his
[00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:54.110] own
[00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:54.510] possible
[00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.810] bank
[00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:55.190] accounts.
[00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.370] Yeah.
[00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:55.990] Spend
[00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.130] all
[00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:56.250] the
[00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:56.470] money
[00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.670] with
[00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.870] it.
[00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.430] Right.
[00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.910] So
[00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:00.210] and
[00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:00.350] then
[00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:00.490] he
[00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:01.550] said,
[00:58:01.650 --> 00:58:01.750] I
[00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.990] remember
[00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.190] there
[00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.290] was
[00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:02.430] a
[00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:02.650] blog
[00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:03.010] post
[00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:03.210] where
[00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:03.330] he
[00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:03.510] just
[00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.690] sort
[00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:03.810] of
[00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:04.170] said
[00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:04.290] he
[00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:04.490] did
[00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:04.770] that.
[00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.930] And
[00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:04.990] it
[00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.110] was
[00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:05.230] just
[00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.450] like,
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:07.500] yeah,
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:07.740] we
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:07.880] were
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:08.800] making
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:09.260] fees
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:09.460] and
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:09.780] stuff.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:09.960] So
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.140] it
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:10.140] was
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:10.500] OK.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:10.720] We
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:10.900] thought
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:11.040] we
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:11.140] could
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:11.320] just
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:11.680] top
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:11.820] it
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:12.080] up.
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:12.780] And
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:13.160] then
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.540] it's
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:14.720] like
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:14.860] where
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:15.000] the
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:15.160] two
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:15.640] graphs
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.040] just
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:16.740] diverge,
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.260] unfortunately.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:17.600] And
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:17.740] it
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:17.900] just
[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:18.080] went
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:18.240] to
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:18.580] zero.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:20.660] But
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:20.800] it
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:20.920] was
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:21.080] just
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:21.220] an
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:21.520] amazing
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:21.880] blog
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.100] post
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:22.280] where
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:22.400] it's
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:22.580] like,
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:22.740] wait,
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:22.940] you're
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:23.100] just
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:23.400] admitting
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:23.660] to
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:23.900] a
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.080] whole
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:24.300] bunch
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:24.440] of
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:24.680] crimes
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:24.920] here.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:25.220] You
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:25.480] probably
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:25.720] shouldn't
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:25.820] have
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:25.960] written
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:26.260] this.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:27.380] And
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:27.520] then
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:27.700] he
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:28.640] fled
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:28.820] to
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:29.100] China.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:29.340] But
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:29.440] I
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:29.560] think
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:29.660] they
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:29.840] got
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.060] him.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:30.440] He's
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:30.560] in
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:30.700] jail
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:30.880] now
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:30.980] or
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:31.260] something.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:33.700] Anyway,
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:34.320] so
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.440] there's
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:35.580] a
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:35.720] lot
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.120] of
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:36.760] pretty
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.440] bad
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:37.820] actors
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:38.100] in
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:38.200] the
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:38.500] exchange
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:38.900] space.
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:40.740] It's
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:41.260] not
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:42.040] well
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:42.380]-run,
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:42.740] generally.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:43.140] But
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:43.500] there's
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:43.800] enormous
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:44.120] amounts
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:44.260] of
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:44.540] profit,
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.220] which
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:45.860] to
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:46.040] me
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:46.440] seems
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:46.760] like
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.080] an
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:47.500] inefficiency,
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:47.840] right?
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:48.020] Wait,
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:48.220] why
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:48.360] are
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:48.500] these
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:48.700] people
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:49.000] making
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:49.140] $1
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:49.320] million
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:49.620] a
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:49.740] day
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:49.900] for
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.160] something
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:50.400] that
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.480] is
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:51.660] sort
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:51.860] of
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:52.180] just
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:52.460] running
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:52.940] automatically
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:53.200] on
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:53.340] this
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:53.640] computer?
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:54.100] That
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:54.640] seems
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.800] like
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.340] right
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:56.540] poor
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:57.000] disruption.
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:57.640] And
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:57.780] so
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:57.980] there's
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:58.080] a
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:58.160] lot
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:58.280] of
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:58.480] people
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:58.820] interested
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:58:59.300] in,
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:58:59.560] OK,
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:58:59.700] how
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:58:59.820] do
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:58:59.960] we
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:00.500] decentralize
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:00.660] the
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:01.000] exchanges,
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:01.340] make
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:01.580] them
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:02.860] less
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:03.920] trust
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:04.240]-involved,
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:04.460] less
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:04.700] risk
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:05.120]-involved,
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:06.720] and
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.060] probably
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:07.380] make
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:07.960] less
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.300] money
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:08.960] than
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:09.640] Poloniex
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:10.040] or
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:10.560] OKCoin
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:10.700] or
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:10.940] whatever.
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:11.860] But
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.680] that's
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:13.840] sort
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:13.980] of
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:14.220] better
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:14.520] because
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:14.680] an
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:15.000] exchange
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:15.340] where
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:15.780] there's
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:15.940] less
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:16.320] profitability
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:16.820] means
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:17.160] more
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:17.360] people
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:17.480] are
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:17.720] going
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:17.800] to
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:17.900] want
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.000] to
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:18.140] trade
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:18.280] on
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:18.680] it
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.260] because
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:19.460] there's
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:19.640] lower
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:19.840] fees.
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:20.520] So
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.960] there's
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.020] a
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:22.100] lot
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.160] of
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.380] research
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:22.600] into
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:22.900] this.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:23.580] I
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:23.680] think
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:23.780] it's
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:23.920] pretty
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.220] cool.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:26.420] So
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:26.880] next
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.020] class
[00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:28.200] on
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:28.480] Wednesday,
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:28.720] I'll
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:28.900] talk
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:29.160] about
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:29.660] discrete
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:29.880] log
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:30.280] contracts,
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:30.620] which
[00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:32.190] share
[00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.750] some
[00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.970] of
[00:59:32.970 --> 00:59:33.210] these
[00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:33.590] issues
[00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:34.070] in
[00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:34.310] that
[00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:35.410] it's
[00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:35.550] a
[00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:35.750] different
[00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.950] way
[00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:36.130] to
[00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:36.510] execute
[00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.710] a
[00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.930] trade,
[00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:37.510] but
[00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.650] it
[00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:37.970] doesn't
[00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:38.170] really
[00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:38.530] define
[00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:38.890] how
[00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:39.150] you
[00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:39.670] find
[00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:40.010] people
[00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:40.210] to
[00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:40.530] execute
[00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:40.770] that
[00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:40.990] trade.
[00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:42.130] I
[00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:42.750] personally
[00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.990] am
[00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.190] more
[00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.510] interested
[00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.790] in
[00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:43.950] the
[00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:44.170] discrete
[00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:44.350] log
[00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:44.630] contract
[00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.970] stuff,
[00:59:45.330 --> 00:59:45.630] probably
[00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.830] because
[00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:46.210] I
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.000] came
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.140] up
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:47.280] with
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:47.540] it,
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:47.900] but
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:48.340] also
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:49.020] because
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:49.900] I'm
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:50.260] not
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:50.720] that
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.020] excited
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:51.300] about
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:51.680] altcoins
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:52.080] in
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:52.340] general.
[00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:54.190] I
[00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.290] don't
[00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:54.450] know.
[00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.830] People
[00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:55.010] like
[00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.350] altcoins.
[00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:55.550] But
[00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:56.250] I
[00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:56.450] don't
[00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.950] really
[00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:57.230] feel
[00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.450] like,
[00:59:57.550 --> 00:59:57.710] oh,
[00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.910] we
[00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:58.050] need
[00:59:58.050 --> 00:59:58.170] to
[00:59:58.170 --> 00:59:58.430] have
[00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.810] all
[00:59:58.810 --> 00:59:58.990] these
[00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.310] different
[00:59:59.310 --> 00:59:59.790] altcoins
[00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:00.030] that
[01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:00.250] act
[01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:00.710] like
[01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:01.070] money.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:02.440] I
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:02.520] don't
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:02.740] know,
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:03.960] which
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.140] is
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:04.460] mostly
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:04.640] what
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:04.880] cross
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:04.980]-chain
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.220] swaps
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:05.380] let
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:05.460] you
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:05.600] do.
[01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.970] So
[01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:07.090] the
[01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:07.310] discrete
[01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:07.490] log
[01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.790] contract
[01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:08.090] has
[01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:08.350] the
[01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:08.710] same
[01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:09.130] issues
[01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:09.490] with
[01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:11.010] how
[01:00:11.010 --> 01:00:11.110] do
[01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:11.190] you
[01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.370] find
[01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:11.530] each
[01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:11.730] other.
[01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:12.290] And
[01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:13.350] it's
[01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:13.990] mostly
[01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.170] a
[01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:14.550] scalability
[01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:14.770] thing.
[01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:15.030] You
[01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.170] can
[01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:15.310] do
[01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:15.510] this
[01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:16.150] OTC,
[01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.590] where
[01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:16.730] you
[01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:17.190] talk
[01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.270] in
[01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.370] a
[01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:17.530] chat
[01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:17.810] room,
[01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.230] and
[01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.350] you
[01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:18.690] know
[01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:18.890] each
[01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:19.150] other,
[01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:19.650] and
[01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:19.750] you
[01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.950] trade
[01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:20.150] that
[01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.350] way.
[01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:21.130] And
[01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:21.350] that's
[01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:21.490] the
[01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:21.670] level
[01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.870] it
[01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:22.010] is
[01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:22.150] right
[01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.450] now,
[01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:22.710] but
[01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.930] how
[01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:23.050] to
[01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:23.250] scale
[01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:23.350] it
[01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:23.510] up.
