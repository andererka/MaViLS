[00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.770] I
[00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.890] think

[00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.090] take
[00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.210] a

[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.840] we've
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.000] talked

[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.460] but
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.680] not
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.060] fully.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.980] You've

[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.560] not
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.800] there
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.940] on
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.120] the

[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.240] or
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.060] it's
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.260] something
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.460] that
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.580] you
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.760] think

[00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.310] So
[00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.750] two
[00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.970] independent
[00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.350] developers
[00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.490] in
[00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.590] the
[00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.750] area
[00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.890] are
[00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.950] going
[00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.030] to
[00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.190] come
[00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.310] by
[00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.430] and
[00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.610] talk
[00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.950] about
[00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.650] how
[00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.790] they
[00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.990] started
[00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.150] their
[00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.490] companies,
[00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.770] what
[00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.850] do
[00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.970] they
[00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.290] do,
[00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.970] what's
[00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.070] their
[00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.290] daily
[00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.610] life,
[00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.850] things
[00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.050] like
[00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.310] that.
[00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.890] And
[00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.030] then
[00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.330] another
[00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.690] one
[00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.130] following
[00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.530] that
[00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.070] is
[00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.710] the
[00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.150] community
[00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.630] manager
[00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.010] for
[00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.730] Firehose
[00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.170] Games.
[00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.770] Sean
[00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.170] Baptiste
[00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.310] is
[00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.430] going
[00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.510] to
[00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.670] talk
[00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.790] to
[00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.950] us
[00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.270] about
[00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.930] how
[00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.090] do
[00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.950] they
[00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.110] get
[00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.270] their
[00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.630] games
[00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.970] out
[00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.130] in
[00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.250] the
[00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.430] world
[00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.550] and
[00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.650] how
[00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.750] they
[00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.870] get
[00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.050] people
[00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.150] to
[00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.290] play
[00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.450] their
[00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.750] games.
[00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.350] And
[00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.570] how
[00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.670] do
[00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.810] they
[00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.210] engage
[00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.710] their
[00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.530] fan
[00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.850] base.
[00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.330] And
[00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.670] how
[00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.770] do
[00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.870] they
[00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.010] even
[00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.290] just
[00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.550] create
[00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.650] a
[00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.810] fan
[00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.990] base
[00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.130] in
[00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.350] general.
[00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.230] So
[00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.410] that's
[00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.590] not
[00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.690] on
[00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.790] the
[00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.030] syllabus,
[00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.250] but
[00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.290] we
[00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.430] will
[00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.550] be
[00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.690] doing
[00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.950] that.
[00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.910] Any
[00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.050] other
[00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.330] topics?
[00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.490] I'm
[00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.550] going
[00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.550] to
[00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.710] ask
[00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.830] this
[00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.090] again
[00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.250] in
[00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.330] a
[00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.450] couple
[00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.750] weeks
[00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.150] in
[00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.290] case
[00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.510] something
[00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.770] pops
[00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.950] up,
[00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.070] because
[00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.170] you
[00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.370] probably
[00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.670] haven't
[00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.890] done
[00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.450] a
[00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.590] lot
[00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.710] of
[00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.990] technical
[00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.370] things
[00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.590] with
[00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.410] your
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.720] game
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.960] engines
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.220] yet.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.160] So
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.320] if
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.500] there's
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.820] anything
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.100] gaming
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.500] specific
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.760] that
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.860] you
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.000] might
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.240] want
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.360] to
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.500] know
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.800] about,
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.660] either
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.040] let
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.180] us
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.400] know
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.660] through
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.380] the
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.540] video
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.760] game
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.020] bosses
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.760] email
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.160] address,
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.040] or
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.620] let
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.740] us
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.840] know
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.920] a
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.200] class.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.360] Yeah?
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.320] I
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.520] can
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.700] get
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.960] people.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.160] So
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.280] I
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.700] can
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.840] get
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.120] people
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.320] who
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.640] are
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.420] local.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.800] We've
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.920] got
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.240] connections
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.480] to
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.700] local
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.120] industry.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.060] We've
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.200] got
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.620] connections
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.180] to
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.440] the
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.620] people
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.760] who
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.940] make
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.080] the
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.340] tools,
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.580] in
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.780] some
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.080] cases,
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.400] depending
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.540] on
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.660] the
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.820] tool.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.520] That's
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.620] kind
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.660] of
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.760] why
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.880] I'm
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.060] asking
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.260] now,
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.360] because
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.460] it
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.600] gives
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.700] me
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.980] time
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.660] to
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.920] fill
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.080] new
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.340] gaps.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.800] Also,
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.160] it
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.280] might
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.420] be
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.620] something
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.820] that
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.980] we
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.080] can
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.260] talk
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.420] to.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.600] So
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.680] if
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.820] there's
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.000] anything
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.380] design
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.680] related
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.040] that
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.280] you
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.420] think
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.540] is
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.820] useful
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.060] for
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.620] your
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.980] games
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.120] that
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.200] we
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.380] haven't
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.580] talked
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.780] about
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.020] yet,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.080] and
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.140] you
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.260] don't
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.420] see
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.500] it
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.580] on
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.680] the
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.920] schedule,
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.120] let

[00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.850] to
[00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.930] be
[00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.010] a
[00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.090] little
[00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.230] bit
[00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.310] of
[00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.130] interactivity
[00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.410] in
[00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.490] the
[00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.750] talk.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.720] I've
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.880] given
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.100] this
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.320] talk
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.780] before.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.480] I
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.800] rewrote
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.960] the
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.280] lectures,
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.420] and
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.520] I
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.680] haven't
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.840] given
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.000] it
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.180] since
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.300] I
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.500] rewrote
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.620] the
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.860] lecture.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.080] So
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.220] we'll
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.360] see
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.480] how
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.600] it
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.920] goes.
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.600] They're
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.740] my
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.040] backup
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.280] to
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.400] let
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.500] me
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.620] know
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.760] if
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.860] I
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.060] forgot
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.460] anything.
[00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.890] There
[00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.070] will
[00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.210] be
[00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.370] some
[00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.590] reading
[00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.810] on
[00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.970] this
[00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.090] that
[00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.210] I'm
[00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.250] going
[00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.330] to
[00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.510] put
[00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.730] into
[00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.070] Stellar.
[00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.290] So
[00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.450] if
[00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.570] you
[00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.770] are
[00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.990] interested
[00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.210] in
[00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.330] the
[00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.590] topic,
[00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.810] if
[00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.210] you
[00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.390] have
[00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.550] more
[00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.790] interest
[00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.870] in
[00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.970] the
[00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.150] topic
[00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.290] and
[00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.370] you
[00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.530] want
[00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.650] to
[00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.750] read
[00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.850] the
[00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.090] reading,
[00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.610] I
[00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.790] highly
[00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.130] recommend
[00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.430] it,
[00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.910] especially
[00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:03.070] if
[00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.150] you
[00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.290] think
[00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.430] you're
[00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.510] going
[00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.570] to
[00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.710] be
[00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.810] in
[00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.890] a
[00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:04.110] leadership
[00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.510] position
[00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.690] in
[00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.790] the
[00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:05.050] future,
[00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.610] or
[00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.750] any
[00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.870] kind
[00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.970] of
[00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.430] managerial
[00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.810] position,
[00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.350] or
[00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.570] you're
[00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.870] interested
[00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.070] in
[00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.270] just
[00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.690] psychology
[00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.010] and
[00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.150] how
[00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.370] people
[00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.870] talk
[00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.990] to
[00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.090] each
[00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.230] other
[00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.370] and
[00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.530] work
[00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.750] together.
[00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.230] So
[00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.470] our
[00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.710] three
[00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.910] main
[00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.290] topics.
[00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.450] This
[00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.570] will
[00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.770] actually
[00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.930] be
[00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:15.290] pretty
[00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.630] quick
[00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.050] on
[00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.190] this
[00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.490] lecture.
[00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.670] We're
[00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.730] going
[00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.770] to
[00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.390] do
[00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.510] a
[00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.630] really
[00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.850] quick
[00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:19.050] review
[00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.210] of
[00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.450] Agile.
[00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.690] We're
[00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.770] going
[00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.790] to
[00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.930] talk
[00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.090] about
[00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.230] team
[00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.630] dynamics.
[00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.230] And
[00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.350] then
[00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.470] we're
[00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.530] going
[00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.590] to
[00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.810] talk
[00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.170] about
[00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.970] how
[00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.170] do
[00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.590] distributed
[00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.950] Agile
[00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.390] teams
[00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.890] perform.
[00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.210] So
[00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.430] what
[00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.510] are
[00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.690] some
[00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.810] of
[00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.110] the
[00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.430] best
[00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.850] practices
[00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.090] they
[00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.430] have
[00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.050] for
[00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.410] performing.
[00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.250] And
[00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.350] then
[00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.490] you're
[00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.550] going
[00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.550] to
[00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.690] work
[00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.790] in
[00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.090] class.
[00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.830] You'll
[00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.970] have
[00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.110] at
[00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.230] least
[00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.370] two
[00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.570] hours
[00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.690] to
[00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.830] work
[00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.910] in
[00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.150] class
[00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.330] today,
[00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.470] if
[00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.570] not
[00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.670] a
[00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.770] little
[00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.890] bit
[00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.010] more
[00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.110] than
[00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.310] that.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.860] So
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.220] Agile
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.720] processes.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.100] If
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.380] you
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.100] forget
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.680] everything
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.000] in
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.140] this
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.600] class,
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.440] you
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.560] end
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.700] the
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.980] class,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.100] you
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.260] got
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.420] into
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.880] the
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.040] real
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.280] world.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.400] And
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.840] somebody
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.160] asks
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.360] you,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.020] what
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.180] is
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.660] Agile?
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.460] I
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.680] hope
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.800] you
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.080] remember
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.360] this
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.680] part.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.000] Iterative
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.360] development.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.800] Does
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.140] anybody
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.920] consider
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.100] what
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.200] they're
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.440] doing
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.860] iterative
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.540] development
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.780] on
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.880] their
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.180] projects
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.380] right
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.620] now?
[00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.270] Are
[00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.650] you
[00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.650] working
[00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.230] in
[00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.570] short
[00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.890] periods
[00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.030] of
[00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.310] time?
[00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.530] So
[00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.730] you've
[00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.910] broken
[00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.050] up
[00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.170] your
[00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.390] time
[00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.550] into
[00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.950] small
[00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:02.530] sprints.
[00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.430] Are
[00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.690] you
[00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.130] doing
[00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.570] all?
[00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.770] You
[00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.950] can't
[00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.090] really
[00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.270] read
[00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.390] it
[00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.650] that
[00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.810] well
[00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.910] on
[00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:06.010] the
[00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.270] slide.
[00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.150] But
[00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.390] are
[00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.610] you,
[00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.970] within
[00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.330] that
[00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.590] short
[00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.790] period
[00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.930] of
[00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.210] time,
[00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.990] designing
[00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.230] what
[00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.390] you're
[00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.490] going
[00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.550] to
[00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.770] work
[00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.010] on,
[00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.510] planning
[00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.950] how
[00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.130] it's
[00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.210] going
[00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.310] to
[00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.570] work,
[00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.950] doing
[00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.210] it,
[00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.430] and
[00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.610] then
[00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.030] testing
[00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.350] it,
[00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.490] evaluating
[00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.730] the
[00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.970] test,
[00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.090] and
[00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.350] changing
[00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.450] it?
[00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.530] Are
[00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.590] you
[00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.750] doing
[00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.990] all
[00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.090] of
[00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.210] that
[00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.450] within
[00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.690] one
[00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.890] week
[00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.030] or
[00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.510] two
[00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.650] week
[00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.930] cycle?
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.920] Raise
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.020] your
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.260] hands,
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.460] yay.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.080] So
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.720] yes,
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.960] raise
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.060] your
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.360] hands.
[00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.190] No,
[00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.450] raise
[00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.570] your
[00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.930] hands.
[00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.050] It's
[00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.230] OK
[00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.350] if
[00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.450] you
[00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.570] say
[00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.850] no?
[00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.310] OK.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.000] If
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.500] you're
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.760] doing
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.040] something
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.300] that
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.500] looks
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.680] like
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.980] this,
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.240] then
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.480] great.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.820] And
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.200] as
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.320] we
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.600] remember,
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.220] Agile,
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.340] in
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.580] particular,
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.960] scrum
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.500] processes,
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.520] they're
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.740] based
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.860] on
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.980] these
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.180] three
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.440] pillars
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.740] that
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.380] Sarah
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.660] talked
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.880] about
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.000] when
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.120] we
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.280] first
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.440] brought
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.600] this
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.820] up.
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.260] So
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.660] the
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.860] pillar
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.980] of
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.480] transparency,
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.340] and
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.460] when
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.580] we
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.720] mean
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.860] by
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.260] transparency
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.560] there,
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.760] we
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.920] really
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.060] just
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.160] mean
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.280] a
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.540] common
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.160] nomenclature.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.740] To
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.880] be
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.040] honest,
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.280] I
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.440] don't
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.680] care
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.900] what
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.040] you
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.300] call
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.480] the
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.740] things
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.360] that
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.520] you
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.580] use
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.720] as
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.860] part
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.940] of
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:58.020] your
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.380] process
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.560] in
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.720] your
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.380] team.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.940] So
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.160] long
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.300] as
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.780] everyone
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.220] within
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.380] the
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.660] team
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.400] knows
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.620] what
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.740] it
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.100] is,
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.740] so
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.260] long
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.700] as
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.080] whoever
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.440] you're
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:05.720] submitting
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.280] those
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.460] processes
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.820] to
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.140] also
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.040] know
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.180] who
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.300] it
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.520] is.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.960] So
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.060] we're
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.200] not
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.460] acting
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.600] as
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.700] your
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.940] product
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.160] owners
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.300] in
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.380] the
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.600] class.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.740] But
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.840] if
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:11.920] you
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.100] had
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.220] a
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.440] product
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.680] owner,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.400] they
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.540] should
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.800] also
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.060] know
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.240] what
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.380] you're
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.600] calling
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.840] things,
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.060] what
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.200] you're
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.380] calling
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.520] your
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.700] product
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.080] backlog,
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.840] what
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:16.980] you're
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.180] calling
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.320] a
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.720] task,
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.820] how
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.020] you're
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.420] estimating,
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.580] and
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:19.740] how
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.880] you're
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.040] doing
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.180] your
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.560] processes.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.200] So
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.520] everyone
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.680] on
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.760] the
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.880] team
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.020] should
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.140] know
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.260] it,
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:22.460] not
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.860] just
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:23.460] in
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.620] a
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.800] more
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.120] traditional
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.500] manner,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.760] a
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:24.960] project
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.220] manager
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.480] knowing
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.680] what
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.040] all
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.140] the
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.500] processes
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.800] are.
[00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.150] There's
[00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.390] a
[00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.530] number
[00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:28.670] of
[00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.050] inspection
[00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.310] that's
[00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.510] going
[00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.850] on.
[00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.230] So
[00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.330] through
[00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.490] the
[00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.890] process,
[00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.130] you
[00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.230] are
[00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.550] taking
[00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.730] a
[00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.850] look
[00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:32.950] at
[00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:33.110] all
[00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.250] the
[00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.670] artifacts
[00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.890] that
[00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.930] you
[00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.230] created.
[00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.510] So
[00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.890] those
[00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:35.630] backlog
[00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.190] items,
[00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.050] task
[00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.390] lists,
[00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.690] things
[00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:37.870] like
[00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:38.030] that
[00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.170] that
[00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.330] you're
[00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.570] creating
[00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.730] during
[00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:38.870] the
[00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.330] process.
[00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.790] You're
[00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.190] inspecting
[00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:41.310] it,
[00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:41.650] and
[00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:41.750] in
[00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:41.990] particular,
[00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.190] you're
[00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.550] inspecting
[00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.630] it
[00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:42.870] during
[00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.250] meetings.
[00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.570] So
[00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:43.690] you're
[00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:43.910] taking
[00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.050] a
[00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:44.170] look
[00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:44.270] at
[00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.410] what
[00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:44.590] you've
[00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:44.870] done
[00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.650] in
[00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.750] a
[00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:45.990] meeting
[00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.350] and
[00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.690] talking
[00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:46.970] about
[00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.170] it.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:47.920] So
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.020] you're
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.160] not
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.280] just
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.460] doing
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:48.580] a
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:48.840] process,
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.120] you're
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.240] doing
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.380] a
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:49.800] process,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:50.580] and
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:50.680] you're
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:50.900] talking
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.180] about
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.320] it,
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.460] and
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.600] you're
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:51.920] actively
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.260] thinking
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.500] about
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.640] the
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.020] process.
[00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.450] And
[00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:54.590] then
[00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:54.710] you're
[00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.050] adapting.
[00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.610] So
[00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.170] based
[00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:56.350] on
[00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.830] evidence,
[00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:57.790] based
[00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.810] on
[00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.710] needs,
[00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:00.690] changes
[00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:00.850] in
[00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:01.010] needs,
[00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.110] you
[00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.210] are
[00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:01.570] changing
[00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:01.770] that
[00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.110] process.
[00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:02.930] Again,
[00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.050] if
[00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.170] you're
[00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.350] doing
[00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.590] any
[00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:03.750] one
[00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:03.830] of
[00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.970] these
[00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:04.150] three
[00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.450] things,
[00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:04.630] you're
[00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:04.770] doing
[00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.110] process
[00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.310] as
[00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.590] well,
[00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.970] and
[00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:06.050] you're
[00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.210] doing
[00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:06.450] Agile.
[00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.150] You're
[00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:07.310] doing
[00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:07.670] some
[00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:08.030] form
[00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.210] of
[00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.730] Agile
[00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.410]-like
[00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.070] process.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:10.910] That's
[00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.390] another
[00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.550] thing
[00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.630] I
[00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:11.750] hope
[00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:11.830] you
[00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.210] take
[00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:12.350] from
[00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.430] the
[00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.690] class.
[00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.070] The
[00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.450] Agile
[00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.310] manifesto,
[00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:16.630] it
[00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.610] is
[00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:17.710] a
[00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.230] manifesto.
[00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:18.370] It
[00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:18.510] is
[00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.650] an
[00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:19.010] idea.
[00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:21.450] It
[00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:21.530] is
[00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:21.710] something
[00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:21.870] that
[00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:21.950] has
[00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.050] some
[00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:22.290] political
[00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:22.470] weight
[00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:22.730] behind
[00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:22.850] it.
[00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:22.970] It
[00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:23.010] is
[00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:23.270] saying,
[00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:23.470] this
[00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:23.610] is
[00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:23.730] the
[00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:23.850] way
[00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:23.970] to
[00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:24.130] do
[00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.390] things.
[00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.590] This
[00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:24.650] is
[00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:24.770] the
[00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:24.930] right
[00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:25.070] way
[00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.190] to
[00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:25.330] do
[00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:25.730] things.
[00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:26.510] But
[00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.650] it's
[00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:26.890] actually
[00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:27.110] more
[00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.390] vague
[00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:27.570] than
[00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:27.810] that.
[00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.370] It's
[00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:28.530] really
[00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:28.770] just
[00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.110] saying,
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.240] here
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.500] are
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:30.720] some
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.100] four
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.440] key
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:31.920] things
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.180] that
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:32.360] we
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:32.680] feel
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:32.880] are
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.080] more
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.460] important
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:33.780] than
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.040] other
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.300] four
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:34.520] key
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:34.940] things.
[00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.110] And
[00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.570] today,
[00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:37.190] we're
[00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.290] going
[00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:37.370] to
[00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.730] focus.
[00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.030] So
[00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:38.210] the
[00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:38.410] first
[00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:39.190] item
[00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.550] is
[00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.410] individuals
[00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:40.690] and
[00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.190] interactions
[00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.650] over
[00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.210] processes
[00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:42.610] and
[00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:42.950] tools.
[00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.710] So
[00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:43.830] we've
[00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:43.910] been
[00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.110] talking
[00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.210] to
[00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:44.230] you
[00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.330] a
[00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:44.410] lot
[00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:44.570] about
[00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.910] process
[00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.090] and
[00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.390] tools
[00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.230] for
[00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.590] the
[00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.070] first
[00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.230] part
[00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:47.290] of
[00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:47.370] the
[00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:47.650] semester.
[00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:47.810] And
[00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:47.910] now
[00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.030] we're
[00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.090] going
[00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:48.130] to
[00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:48.310] talk
[00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.510] about
[00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.070] individuals
[00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.070] and
[00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.730] interactions
[00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.090] between
[00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:51.530] individuals.
[00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.290] So
[00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:52.410] you're
[00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:52.550] team
[00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.790] members.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:54.480] All
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:54.620] right,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.780] what's
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:55.860] a
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.100] team?
[00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.610] Anybody
[00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:57.830] give
[00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:57.950] me
[00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:58.090] a
[00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:58.310] working
[00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.730] definition
[00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.950] for
[00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:59.090] what
[00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.250] you'd
[00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.370] call
[00:08:59.370 --> 00:08:59.490] a
[00:08:59.490 --> 00:08:59.650] team?
[00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:03.230] What'd
[00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.270] you
[00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:03.450] say?
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.380] A
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:05.520] bunch
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:05.640] of
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:05.900] puppies?
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:06.500] Is
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:06.560] it
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:06.660] a
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:06.780] group
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:06.900] of
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.140] people?
[00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.790] Is
[00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.890] it
[00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:09.070] just
[00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:09.190] a
[00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.310] group
[00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.410] of
[00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.670] people?
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.300] Anything
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:14.640] else?
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.240] So
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.340] it's
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:17.420] a
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:17.640] collection
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:17.800] of
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.240] individuals.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:18.660] So
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:18.760] it's
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:18.820] a
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:18.940] group
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.040] of
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.300] people.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:19.940] They're
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.180] working
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:20.400] toward
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:20.500] a
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:20.680] common
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.040] purpose.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.820] They
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.060] have
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:22.420] shared
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:22.960] responsibility
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.340] for
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:23.660] common
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.060] outcomes.
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:24.340] If
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:24.460] one
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:24.540] of
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:24.700] those
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:24.980] puppies
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.320] trips,
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.020] that
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.220] stick
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.440] goes
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:26.540] in
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:26.760] another
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.120] puppy's
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.340] mouth,
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:27.480] and
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:27.580] it
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:27.820] hurts
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:27.980] a
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.160] lot.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.120] So
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.360] I
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:31.860] want
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:31.940] you
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.180] to
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.020] keep
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.200] that
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.320] in
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:33.520] mind.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:33.960] Shared
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.720] responsibility,
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:35.660] common
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.060] purpose,
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:36.440] common
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:36.780] outcome.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:38.800] All
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:38.920] right,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.180] so
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.320] teams
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.620] evolve
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:40.840] over
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.140] time.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.380] And
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:43.820] the
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.200] little
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:44.320] bit
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.400] of
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:44.600] research
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:44.780] I'm
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:44.820] going
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:44.880] to
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.080] talk
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.280] about
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:45.540] actually
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.020] comes
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.660] from
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.460] studying
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:48.860] group
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.480] behaviors.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:50.740] But
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.100] this
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.240] is
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.380] all
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:51.540] from
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:51.760] about
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:51.860] the
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.920] 1960s
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.100] and
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.400] on
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:53.640] up.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:53.960] And
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.140] around
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.300] the
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:54.900] 2000s,
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:54.980] and
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.100] I'll
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.360] post
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:55.500] this
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:55.700] reading
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:55.900] up,
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:56.660] it
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:56.800] was
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.140] proven,
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:57.400] or
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.720] there
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:57.800] were
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:57.920] some
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.200] studies
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.420] showing
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:58.560] that
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:58.760] this
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.020] actually
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.200] works
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.360] for
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:09:59.620] teams.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:09:59.820] This
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.240] does
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.460] work
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:00.780] for
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.380] people
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:01.540] who
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:01.640] have
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:01.740] a
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:01.900] common
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.100] goal.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:02.880] But
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.040] as
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.120] you
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.220] get
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:03.320] a
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:03.440] bunch
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:03.540] of
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:03.700] people
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.000] together,
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.120] and
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.240] you
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.320] get
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:04.420] a
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:04.680] small
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:04.860] group
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:04.980] of
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.140] people
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.440] together,
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:05.600] and
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:05.700] in
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:05.820] our
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.080] terms
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.260] we're
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:06.420] calling
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:06.800] a
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.000] small
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.180] group
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:07.280] of
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:07.540] people
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.600] 8
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:08.720] to
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:08.920] 10
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.280] people.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:10.600] Maybe
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:10.740] a
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:10.820] little
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:10.980] bit
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.160] bigger,
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.320] but
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:11.500] about
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:11.720] 10
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.020] people
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:12.520] total.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.560] They're
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:14.680] going
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:14.780] to
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.120] evolve
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.500] based
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:15.820] on
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.040] those
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.480] interpersonal
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.080] relationships.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:17.540] So
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:17.780] how
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:17.980] they
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.160] know
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.340] each
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:18.540] other,
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:18.760] what
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:18.900] they
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.160] talk
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.460] about,
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.000] how
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.160] they
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.400] talk
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:20.680] about,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.500] and
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:21.900] their
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.260] task
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:22.840] behaviors.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:23.520] So
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.220] we're
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:24.280] going
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:24.320] to
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.380] be
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:24.600] talking
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:24.740] about
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:24.900] not
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.060] the
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.540] tasks
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:25.840] that
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.360] you
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.500] are
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:26.760] doing
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.000] in
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.120] your
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.540] teams,
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.180] but
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.360] the
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:28.800] behaviors
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.280] surrounding
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:29.480] the

[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:29.960] that
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.080] you're
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.260] doing.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:30.600] So
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.620] if
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:31.780] you're
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.020] working
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.180] on
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:32.260] a
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:32.540] task,
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:32.720] if
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:32.840] you
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.040] are
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.740] doing
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:33.980] some
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.240] coding,
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:35.520] how
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:35.700] are
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:35.840] you
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.300] coding,
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:36.720] or
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:36.880] who
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.040] are
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.160] you
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.420] coding
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:37.860] with,
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:38.340] how
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:38.460] are
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:38.560] you
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:38.800] talking
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:38.920] to
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.080] other
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.340] people
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:39.580] about
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:39.720] what
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:39.860] you're
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.100] coding?
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.620] And
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:40.700] you
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:40.800] can
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.000] apply
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.120] that
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.220] to
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:41.380] any
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.540] task
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:42.700] that
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:42.820] you're
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.020] doing
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:43.740] in
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:43.860] your
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.120] teams.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.100] There's
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.180] a
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:45.320] lot
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:45.400] of
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:45.580] different
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:45.920] theories.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.220] Actually,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.600] Wikipedia
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:47.960] is
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.080] a
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.220] pretty
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:48.700] good,
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.000] just
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.180] a
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:49.420] good
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.520] nutshell
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:50.880] of
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.360] what
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:51.480] are
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:51.580] all
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:51.660] the
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:51.840] different
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.020] kinds
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.140] of
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:52.400] theories,
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:52.980] and
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.120] how
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.460] different
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.620] kind
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:53.680] of
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:53.940] models
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.480] we
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:54.580] can
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:54.720] use
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:54.860] to
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.300] describe
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:55.520] how
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:55.740] groups
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:55.960] talk
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.080] to
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.200] each
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:56.320] other,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:56.420] and
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:56.540] how
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:56.800] groups
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.620] evolve.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.340] But
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:58.460] they
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:58.620] all
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:58.820] come
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:58.960] down
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.020] to
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.180] these
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:10:59.420] common
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:10:59.800] things.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.340] There's
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:00.420] a
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:00.600] period
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:00.720] of
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:00.880] getting
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.040] to
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.180] know
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:01.340] each
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.540] other.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:02.560] There's
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:02.660] a
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:02.900] period
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.020] of
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.400] experiencing
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:03.900] conflict,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.100] and
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.260] there's
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:04.460] both
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:04.840] positive
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.000] and
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.200] negative
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.640] conflict
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:05.860] when
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:05.960] you're
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.160] talking
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.320] with
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:06.440] each
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:06.600] other.
[00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.830] Your
[00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.290] roles
[00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:08.750] shift
[00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.330] based
[00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:09.590] on
[00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.950] changing
[00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:10.290] knowledge
[00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:10.450] and
[00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:10.710] changing
[00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.290] experience.
[00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:12.110] And
[00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.410] hopefully,
[00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:12.610] at
[00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:12.790] some
[00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.070] point,
[00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:13.590] there's
[00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.730] some
[00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.910] kind
[00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.970] of
[00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:14.390] consensus,
[00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.790] there's
[00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.930] some
[00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:15.090] kind
[00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:15.150] of
[00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.350] moving
[00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.750] forward.
[00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.010] Decisions
[00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:17.350] happen
[00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.770] here.
[00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:18.650] The
[00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.930] point
[00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:19.210] is,
[00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:19.450] though,
[00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.230] what
[00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.430] kind
[00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.530] of
[00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:20.830] decisions
[00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:21.070] get
[00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:21.350] made?
[00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:21.550] Are
[00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:21.690] they
[00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.070] effective
[00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:22.610] decisions?
[00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:23.690] Or
[00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:23.830] are
[00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.070] they
[00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:24.730] ineffective,
[00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.030] unproven?
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.100] They
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.280] get
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.480] made
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:27.720] because
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:27.840] you
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.000] just
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.140] have
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.500] to
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:28.660] make
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:28.760] them,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:28.860] and
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:28.940] you
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.120] have
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.240] to
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:29.420] move
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:29.680] on.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:30.300] And
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.420] what
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:30.500] we're
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:30.740] hoping
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:30.900] is
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.040] that
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.240] by
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.880] analyzing
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.480] how
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:32.660] your
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:32.900] teams
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.220] work,
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.340] you
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:33.480] can
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.640] then
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:33.860] move
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.200] towards
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.480] having
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:34.660] some
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:34.980] effective
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.160] decision
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.080] making.
[00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:38.530] So
[00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:38.930] the
[00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:39.130] model
[00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:39.230] that
[00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.350] we're
[00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.490] going
[00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:39.550] to
[00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.770] talk
[00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.110] about
[00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.790] is
[00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:41.270] Tuckman's
[00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:41.530] model
[00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:41.730] from
[00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:42.090] 65.
[00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.930] It's
[00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.070] got
[00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.370] four
[00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.770] phases.
[00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:45.910] Forming,
[00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.270] norming,
[00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:46.630] storming,
[00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:47.030] performing.
[00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:47.290] It's
[00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:47.470] very
[00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.930] cutesy.
[00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.570] It
[00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:48.830] gets
[00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:49.070] used
[00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:49.250] in
[00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.490] training
[00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.810] sessions
[00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.010] a
[00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:50.210] lot.
[00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:51.590] It
[00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.730] can
[00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:51.870] just
[00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:52.030] be
[00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.250] something
[00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.450] that
[00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:52.550] you
[00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.650] can
[00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:52.790] just
[00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.090] spit
[00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:53.230] out
[00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.370] and
[00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:53.610] say,
[00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.110] and
[00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.290] someone
[00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:54.450] says,
[00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:54.590] oh,
[00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.790] you're
[00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:55.010] smart.
[00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:55.190] You
[00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.350] know
[00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.630] that
[00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.450] model.
[00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.730] But
[00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:56.890] maybe
[00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:56.990] you
[00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.090] don't
[00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:57.210] know
[00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:57.410] everything
[00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:57.690] behind
[00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:57.890] it.
[00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.690] I
[00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:58.890] might
[00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:59.050] be
[00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.230] more
[00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.370] in
[00:11:59.370 --> 00:11:59.590] the,
[00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.210] you're
[00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:00.410] smart,
[00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.550] but
[00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.690] maybe
[00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:00.810] you
[00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:00.930] don't
[00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.070] know
[00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:01.230] more
[00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.630] everything
[00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:01.930] behind
[00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.090] it.
[00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.470] I'm
[00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.630] still
[00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.870] learning
[00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:03.050] about
[00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.450] how
[00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:03.710] this
[00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:04.010] works.
[00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.010] But
[00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:05.230] each
[00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.450] phase
[00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:05.630] has
[00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.830] items
[00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:05.970] you
[00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:06.370] can
[00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:06.870] identify.
[00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:07.930] And
[00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.230] more
[00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.970] useful
[00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:09.230] for
[00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.630] us
[00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.130] is
[00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.330] this
[00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:10.430] is
[00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.530] a
[00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:10.690] model
[00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:10.830] you
[00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:10.950] can
[00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:11.090] use
[00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.230] to
[00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.410] figure
[00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:11.610] out
[00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:11.770] where
[00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:11.950] your
[00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:12.250] team
[00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:12.430] is
[00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.670] right
[00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.970] now.
[00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:14.370] What
[00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:14.730] phase
[00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:14.870] are
[00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.010] you
[00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:15.350] in?
[00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.870] So
[00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.990] you
[00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.090] can
[00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:16.310] then
[00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.690] make
[00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:17.030] decisions
[00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.290] about
[00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:17.510] where
[00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:17.630] you
[00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:17.750] need
[00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.870] to
[00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:18.130] go
[00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:18.370] and
[00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:18.550] how
[00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.690] you
[00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:18.790] need
[00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.870] to
[00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:19.010] work
[00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:19.310] together
[00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.570] better.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:23.580] So
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:23.980] the
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.300] forming
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.520] phase
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:25.640] of
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:25.740] it,
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:25.940] this
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.000] is
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.100] when
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.180] you
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:26.360] first
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:26.520] start
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:26.680] getting
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:26.960] together.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:27.560] Everyone
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:27.820] wants
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:27.920] to
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.060] be
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.360] friendly.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.480] Everyone
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:29.700] wants
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:29.820] to
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:29.940] get
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.320] along
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:30.520] and
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:30.640] be
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:30.980] accepted
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.160] with
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:31.300] each
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:31.500] other.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.000] There
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.180] might
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.320] be
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:33.460] some
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:33.740] serious
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.240] problems
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:34.800] from
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:34.940] the
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:35.060] get
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:35.280] go,
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:35.740] but
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:35.880] they're
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.100] usually
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.500] avoided.
[00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:38.790] And
[00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.010] the
[00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:39.230] team
[00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.510] learns
[00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:39.730] about
[00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:40.150] challenges
[00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.370] and
[00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.670] goals.
[00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.310] But
[00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.510] not
[00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:41.710] much
[00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.890] gets
[00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.170] done.
[00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.070] There's
[00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:43.390] no
[00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.050] real
[00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:44.410] task
[00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:44.810] completion
[00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:45.110] going
[00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.310] on
[00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.410] in
[00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.530] this
[00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.850] stage.
[00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:47.770] Has
[00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:48.010] everybody
[00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:48.430] seen
[00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.670] this?
[00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:49.690] When
[00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:49.770] you
[00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:49.910] think
[00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.030] about
[00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.150] your
[00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.350] previous
[00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:50.550] teams,
[00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:50.750] you've
[00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.870] been
[00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.990] in
[00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.090] this
[00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:51.310] stage,
[00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:51.510] right,
[00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:51.890] when
[00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:51.970] you
[00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:52.150] first
[00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.290] got
[00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:52.590] together?
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:54.200] So
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.720] project
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:54.940] two,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.140] project
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.340] three,
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:55.460] I
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:55.540] want
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.060] to
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.240] ask
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:56.320] you
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:56.420] some
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:56.620] questions
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:56.820] about
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.020] projects
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:57.180] two
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.280] and
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.500] three
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:57.860] as
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:57.960] we
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.060] go
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.300] forward.
[00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.590] All
[00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.770] right.
[00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.390] That's
[00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:01.470] a
[00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:01.670] happy
[00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.030] stage.
[00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:02.270] Then
[00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:02.650] storming
[00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.010] happens.
[00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.210] People
[00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:04.470] are
[00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.670] able
[00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.910] to
[00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.490] express
[00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.270] discontent.
[00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:06.670] There
[00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.890] actually
[00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.090] might
[00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.190] have
[00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.330] been
[00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:07.790] discontent
[00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.090] in
[00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.430] phase
[00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.630] one,
[00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.810] but
[00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:08.910] it
[00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.170] actually
[00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.450] wasn't
[00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:09.710] being
[00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:10.830] expressed
[00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:11.170] in
[00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:11.330] some
[00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:11.610] form.
[00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.110] In
[00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.310] phase
[00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.490] two,
[00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.650] it's
[00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.870] being
[00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.310] expressed.
[00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.570] But
[00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:14.870] how
[00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.070] it's
[00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:15.230] being
[00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.770] expressed
[00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.010] can
[00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:16.130] be
[00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:16.310] kind
[00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.390] of
[00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:16.650] different.
[00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:16.950] So
[00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:17.130] it
[00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:17.290] could
[00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:17.750] be
[00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.230] someone
[00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.690] actively
[00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.130] saying,
[00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.390] no,
[00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:19.670] you're
[00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.930] wrong,
[00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.210] that's
[00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.450] stupid.
[00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.470] It
[00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.650] could
[00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.830] be
[00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:22.030] someone
[00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.270] not
[00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:22.610] talking,
[00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.750] but
[00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.910] they're
[00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.170] feeling
[00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.350] the
[00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.510] same
[00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:24.730] thing
[00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:24.810] and
[00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:24.930] they're
[00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.170] thinking
[00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:25.350] about
[00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.530] the
[00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:25.730] same
[00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.010] thing.
[00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.410] It's
[00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:26.510] the
[00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:26.670] same
[00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:26.830] kind
[00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:26.910] of
[00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:27.350] discontent
[00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.350] that
[00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.630] can
[00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:27.930] happen.
[00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:29.370] Opinions
[00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:29.570] tend
[00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:29.670] to
[00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.770] get
[00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.210] challenged.
[00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:31.010] It
[00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.170] can
[00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:31.310] be
[00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.810] contentious.
[00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.930] It
[00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:32.090] can
[00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.230] be
[00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.570] unpleasant.
[00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.330] In
[00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.030] order
[00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:35.370] to
[00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:35.650] advance
[00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.010] past
[00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:36.190] this
[00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:36.610] stage,
[00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:37.790] what
[00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.890] your
[00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:38.050] team
[00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:38.210] really
[00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.390] needs
[00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:38.510] is
[00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:38.890] tolerance
[00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.150] and
[00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.590] patience,
[00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:40.310] just
[00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.450] to
[00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:40.550] kind
[00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.550] of
[00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.670] get
[00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.850] through
[00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:41.070] it.
[00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.410] But
[00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:41.550] even
[00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.750] more
[00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.070] important,
[00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.230] you
[00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.310] need
[00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.390] to
[00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:42.730] establish
[00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.050] lines
[00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:43.190] of
[00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.510] trust
[00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:43.750] and
[00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.030] open
[00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.590] communication
[00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.810] to
[00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:44.930] get
[00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:45.050] through
[00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.210] this
[00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:45.490] stage.
[00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:46.030] And
[00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.130] this
[00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:46.230] is
[00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.410] what
[00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.030] we've
[00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.110] been
[00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.310] doing
[00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.450] for
[00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:47.570] the
[00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:47.910] past
[00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:48.770] first
[00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:48.870] of
[00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.990] the
[00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.290] semester,
[00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.730] is
[00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.650] creating
[00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:51.170] processes.
[00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.510] We've
[00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:51.610] been
[00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:51.770] giving
[00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:51.930] you
[00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:52.050] some
[00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:52.310] tools
[00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.450] that
[00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:52.530] you
[00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:52.650] can
[00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:52.910] use,
[00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.110] then
[00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.230] you
[00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.330] can
[00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:53.490] then
[00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:53.710] create
[00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.910] those
[00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:54.290] processes
[00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.550] in
[00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.670] your
[00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.030] teams.
[00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:56.010] So
[00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:56.150] just
[00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.270] a
[00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:56.530] quick
[00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:57.870] hand
[00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.250] raise
[00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.490] from
[00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.950] teams.
[00:13:59.730 --> 00:13:59.970] Does
[00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:00.230] anybody
[00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.570] think
[00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:00.730] that
[00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:00.850] they
[00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:00.990] are
[00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.170] in
[00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:01.430] this
[00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.710] stage
[00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:01.950] right
[00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:02.230] now?
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:04.340] Do
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:04.420] you
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:04.500] think
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.500] that
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.500] they
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.500] are
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.500] in
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.500] this
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.500] stage
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.500] right
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.500] now?
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.600] Do
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:04.600] you
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:04.600] think
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:04.680] in
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:04.800] your
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.000] team
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.160] you
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:05.440] are
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.220] currently
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.940] expressing
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.720] discontent,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.120] you
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.500] are
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:09.900] creating
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.380] processes,
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:10.660] you
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:10.820] don't
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.000] have
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.380] processes
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:11.660] yet,
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:11.820] but
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:11.940] you're
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.160] figuring
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:12.340] out
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:12.460] what
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:12.560] your
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:12.880] processes
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.100] might
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.320] be?
[00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.430] Maybe?
[00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.030] What
[00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.050] do
[00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.090] you
[00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:21.270] say?
[00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:21.990] You're
[00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.070] not
[00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:22.230] sure?
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.420] OK.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:24.200] All
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:24.320] right.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.120] Next
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:28.320] up,
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:28.640] norming.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:28.800] So
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:28.920] this
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.000] is
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.100] where
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.180] you
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:29.400] have
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:29.580] those
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:29.980] processes.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.340] Individuals
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:31.460] start
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:31.720] giving
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:31.860] up
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:31.960] their
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.120] own
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.460] ideas
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:32.640] and
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:32.920] goals.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.140] You're
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.840] actually
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.120] moving
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.360] towards
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:34.480] a
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:34.640] team
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:34.800] goal
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:34.980] right
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.240] now.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:35.800] And
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:35.980] people
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.120] are
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.360] starting
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:36.520] to
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:36.680] take
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.160] responsibility
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:37.540] and
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:37.760] rules
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:37.880] are
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.280] established.

[00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:42.330] if
[00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:42.390] you
[00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:42.590] think

[00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:44.230] now.
[00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:49.970] All
[00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:50.130] right,
[00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.270] now
[00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:50.490] raise

[00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.870] you
[00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.010] think
[00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:51.130] your
[00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:51.250] team
[00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:51.370] is

[00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:51.830] storming
[00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:51.970] right
[00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:52.190] now.
[00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.010] OK.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.340] All
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.080] right,
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.300] so
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:03.800] is
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.020] anybody
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.480] performing?

[00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:07.770] Are
[00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:07.930] your
[00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:08.110] team
[00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.330] members
[00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:08.750] already
[00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.190] autonomous?
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:10.960] Is
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.340] dissent
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:11.960] expected
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.580] and
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:12.900] addressed
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.140] right
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:13.360] now?
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:13.580] This
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:13.680] is
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:13.780] where
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:13.880] you
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.040] want
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:14.120] to
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.240] get
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:14.460] to.
[00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.470] You
[00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.710] probably
[00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.930] aren't
[00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:17.130] this
[00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:17.310] far
[00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.550] yet.
[00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.670] My
[00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.870] bets
[00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.950] are
[00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:19.170] probably
[00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:19.470] somewhere
[00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:19.710] in
[00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:20.170] the
[00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:20.510] storming
[00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:20.710] area
[00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.990] things,
[00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:21.250] maybe
[00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:21.730] getting
[00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:21.970] close
[00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:22.090] to
[00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:22.170] the

[00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.550] area
[00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.850] things.
[00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:23.790] Basically,
[00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:24.010] you're
[00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:24.170] still
[00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.130] talking
[00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:25.290] to
[00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:25.390] each
[00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:25.490] other.
[00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:25.650] You're
[00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:25.770] still
[00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:25.990] trying
[00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.090] to
[00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.250] figure
[00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:26.570] out
[00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:27.350] what
[00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.690] are
[00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:27.990] the
[00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.350] different
[00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.570] ways
[00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:28.670] of
[00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.950] communicating
[00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:29.210] with
[00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.350] each
[00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.550] other.
[00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:30.550] What
[00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.690] are
[00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:30.990] the
[00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.450] different
[00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.290] processes
[00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.470] and
[00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.690] rules
[00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:33.810] you
[00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:33.950] might
[00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:34.230] have.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:37.480] And
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:37.580] you
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:37.720] might
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:37.860] not
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:37.980] get
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.140] this
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:38.420] far
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:38.980] in
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.720] class.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:39.940] By
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.020] the
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.120] end
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:40.180] of
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:40.260] the
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:40.440] semester,
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:40.600] you
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:40.760] might
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:40.940] not
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.420] be
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.300] fully
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:42.700] efficient
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:42.900] by
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.020] the
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.880] end
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:43.960] of
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.020] the
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:44.220] class.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:44.320] And
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:44.460] that's
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:44.660] OK.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.360] But
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.460] if
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:46.560] you
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:46.680] are,
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:46.900] it's
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.040] kind
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.140] of
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:47.280] cool.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:50.900] So
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:51.240] the
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:51.500] model
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:51.640] in
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.100] practice
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.520] tends
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:52.680] to
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:52.960] be
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.700] nonlinear.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.300] It
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:54.620] gets
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:54.880] talked
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.080] about.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.260] And
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:55.340] it
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:55.420] was
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:55.780] originally
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.580] established
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:56.940] as
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:57.200] you
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.380] go
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:57.580] from
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:57.800] here,
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:57.960] to
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.180] here,
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:58.320] to
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:58.520] here,
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:58.660] to
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:58.900] here.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.420] You
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:15:59.580] go
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:15:59.740] through
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:15:59.880] the
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.120] phases.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.280] At
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:00.400] the
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:00.480] end
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:00.560] of
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:00.660] the
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:00.880] thing,
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.080] you're
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.300] done.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:01.820] Your
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.080] team's
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.440] awesome.
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:02.840] Go
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:02.980] you.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:03.960] What
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.060] we
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:04.260] actually
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:04.480] see
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:04.600] in
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:04.940] process
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.380] is
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:05.740] that
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.340] teams
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:06.640] tend
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.080] to
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.580] get
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:07.720] in
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:07.820] the
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.120] forming.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:08.900] They
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.060] go
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:09.180] in
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:09.280] the
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:09.660] circle
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.300] where
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:10.440] they
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:10.680] go
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.140] from
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.020] having
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:12.280] some
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:12.860] issues,
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.480] figuring
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:13.740] out
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:13.900] how
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.340] to
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:14.660] deal
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:14.820] with
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.000] those
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.460] issues,
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.380] establish
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:16.620] some
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:16.980] rules.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:17.380] All
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:17.480] right,
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:17.640] we're
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:17.740] doing
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:17.980] really
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.200] well
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:18.460] again.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.040] New
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.400] challenge
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.680] comes
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:19.940] up.
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:20.560] We're
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:20.800] back
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.740] into
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.120] storming.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:23.720] We've
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:23.940] put
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.200] ourselves
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.340] in
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:24.420] a
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:24.680] position
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:24.920] where
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.080] we
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.240] don't
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:25.360] know
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:25.480] how
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:25.580] to
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:25.740] talk
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:25.860] to
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:25.980] each
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.120] other
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.400] or
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:26.600] we
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:26.760] don't
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:26.880] know
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.060] how
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:27.320] to
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:27.680] communicate
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:27.860] with
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:27.980] each
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.100] other.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:32.560] So
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:32.780] there's
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:32.900] some
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.240] problems
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:33.460] with
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:33.540] the
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.100] model.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:34.560] This
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:34.700] is
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:34.940] really
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.280] a
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:35.720] descriptive
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.140] model.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:36.760] It's
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:36.880] a
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.560] tool
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:37.820] for
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.000] us
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.160] to
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.420] use
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:38.640] to
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:38.920] see
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.140] how
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.320] things
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:39.440] are
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:39.660] going.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.140] It's
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:40.380] basically
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:40.520] a
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:40.580] way
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:40.720] to
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.060] evaluate
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:41.560] symptoms.
[00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:44.310] But
[00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.470] there's
[00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.610] no
[00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:44.910] triggers
[00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.090] in
[00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:45.190] the
[00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:45.370] model.
[00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:45.690] We
[00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:45.790] don't
[00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.930] know
[00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:46.090] when
[00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:46.250] those
[00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:46.470] things
[00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.750] happen.
[00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:47.030] When
[00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.650] does
[00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:47.750] your
[00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:47.950] team
[00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:48.250] switch
[00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:48.470] from
[00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.810] storming
[00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:48.910] to
[00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.150] norming?
[00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.950] So
[00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:50.050] this
[00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:50.110] is
[00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.210] what
[00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.330] I'd
[00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:50.470] like
[00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.590] you
[00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.690] to
[00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:50.810] do
[00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.170] in
[00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.290] your
[00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.510] teams.
[00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:51.710] Just
[00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.890] take
[00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:52.010] a
[00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:52.150] couple
[00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.550] minutes.
[00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:53.710] Talk
[00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:54.090] about
[00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.370] your
[00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.850] previous
[00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:56.330] teams
[00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:56.530] you've
[00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:56.670] been
[00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.870] on.
[00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.270] Talk
[00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:57.430] about
[00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.570] the
[00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:57.730] team
[00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:57.870] you're
[00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.970] on
[00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:58.250] now.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:16:59.920] When
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.060] do
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:00.140] you
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:00.320] think
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:00.460] your
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:00.640] team
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:00.760] would
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:00.960] move
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.140] from
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:01.380] stage
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:01.560] to
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:01.920] stage?
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:02.700] And
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:02.900] how
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.080] could
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.180] a
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:03.360] team
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:03.620] move
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.080] intentionally?
[00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:05.730] So
[00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:06.310] and
[00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:06.410] in
[00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:06.650] particular,
[00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.910] think
[00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:07.110] about
[00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.310] that
[00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:07.650] storming
[00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:07.750] to
[00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.970] norming
[00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:08.190] part
[00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:08.290] of
[00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:08.370] it.
[00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:08.590] So
[00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.850] what
[00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:09.010] is
[00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:09.090] it
[00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:09.190] going
[00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:09.310] to
[00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:09.510] take
[00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.650] for
[00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:09.810] your
[00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:10.070] team
[00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:10.250] right
[00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:10.550] now
[00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:10.990] or
[00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.190] what
[00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:11.490] happened
[00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:11.610] in
[00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:11.710] your
[00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.910] team
[00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:12.090] right
[00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:12.290] now
[00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:12.450] to
[00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:12.690] go
[00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.130] from
[00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.030] we
[00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.150] are
[00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.450] having
[00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:14.830] some
[00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:15.270] difficulty
[00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.610] talking
[00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:15.790] with
[00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:15.890] each
[00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.070] other,
[00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.910] we
[00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.130] have
[00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:17.230] a
[00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.330] bunch
[00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:17.430] of
[00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:17.750] opinions,
[00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:18.110] to
[00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.950] we're
[00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:19.090] on
[00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:19.470] the
[00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.670] same
[00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:20.030] page?
[00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.370] Take
[00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:21.550] three
[00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:21.810] minutes.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.020] Just
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.460] one
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:23.560] thing
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:23.640] I
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:23.760] want
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:23.900] to
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.260] chime
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:24.420] in.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:24.720] There's
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:24.800] a
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.000] very,
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:25.180] very
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:25.500] good
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:25.900] chance
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:26.140] that
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:26.280] your
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:26.520] team
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.020] actually
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:27.360] is
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.580] still
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:27.740] in
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:27.980] forming
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.400] stage.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:28.920] And
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.080] one
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:29.180] of
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:29.300] the
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:29.600] reasons
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:29.920] why
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.380] no
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:30.660] one,
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:31.540] like
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.020] a
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:32.260] very
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:32.440] few
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:32.540] of
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:32.660] you,
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:32.780] might
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:32.880] have
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.000] put
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.120] up
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.240] your
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:33.460] hands
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:33.640] that
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:33.800] you
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:33.980] don't
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:34.380] actually
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:34.780] want
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.420] to
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:35.740] express
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.200] dissent,
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:36.640] which
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:36.800] is
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.240] exactly
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:37.580] the
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:37.980] situation
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.180] that
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:38.260] you
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:38.400] get
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:38.520] in
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:38.580] the
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:38.780] forming
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.120] stage.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.320] It
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:41.760] is
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.640] uncomfortable,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.200] but
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.140] hopefully
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.880] you
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.060] can
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:45.400] logically
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:45.900] see
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.560] the
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.080] benefits
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:47.380] of
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:47.660] being
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:47.820] in
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:47.940] a
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:48.160] team
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.380] where
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:48.540] you
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:48.900] can
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.200] talk
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.420] about
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:49.580] the
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:49.900] things
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.160] that
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.740] you
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.040] disagree
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:51.340] with.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.240] So
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.600] it's
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:53.860] possible
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:54.040] that
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:54.140] you
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.320] are
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:54.520] still
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:54.660] in
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:54.920] forming
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.580] and
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.100] it's
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.220] good
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.340] to
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:56.740] identify
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:56.960] your
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.120] team
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:57.280] as,
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:57.580] OK,
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:57.900] this
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.060] is
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:58.440] a
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:58.780] normal
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.580] evolution
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:17:59.780] of
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:17:59.880] a
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.060] team
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.180] and
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:00.380] that's
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:00.580] where
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.040] our
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.200] team
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.300] is
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:01.440] at
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:01.620] right
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:01.840] now.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.420] So
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:02.700] talk
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:02.920] about
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.180] it
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:03.440] among
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:03.580] your
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:03.700] team.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.060] So
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.220] take
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:05.380] three
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:05.640] minutes.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.000] Just
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.180] talk
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.260] in
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:06.360] your
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:06.640] teams.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.300] And
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:07.480] I'm
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:07.500] going
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:07.500] to
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:07.660] ask
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:07.740] you
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:07.880] some
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.180] questions
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:08.380] when
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:08.480] we're
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:08.640] done.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.100] OK.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.400] Each
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:26.740] group,
[00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:28.090] give
[00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:28.250] me
[00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.930] something
[00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:30.090] you
[00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.310] talked
[00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.670] about
[00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:31.010] about
[00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.670] what
[00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:31.770] are
[00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.230] the
[00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.570] triggers,
[00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:32.870] what
[00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.950] are
[00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:33.070] the
[00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.270] things
[00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.410] you
[00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:33.770] saw
[00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:34.110] as
[00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.190] you
[00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.570] moved.
[00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.490] Just
[00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:35.630] let
[00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.710] me
[00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.850] know
[00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:36.090] which
[00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.410] phases
[00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:36.590] you're
[00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.810] talking
[00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:37.070] about.
[00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.270] So
[00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.410] go
[00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:38.510] ahead.
[00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.510] Go
[00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.550] ahead.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.640] So
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:41.920] we
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.160] have
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.140] two
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.400] subunits
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:45.960] there
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.200] to
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.660] catch
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:46.860] up.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:48.320] OK.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:56.580] How
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:56.700] do
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:56.760] you
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:56.940] know?
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:57.880] What
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.240] caused
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:58.480] that?
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:18:59.700] What
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:18:59.900] caused
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:18:59.980] you
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.080] to
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.220] get
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:00.400] there,
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:00.500] do
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:00.580] you
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:00.740] think?
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:01.740] The
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:09.540] reason
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:09.800] that
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.160] we're
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:11.200] in
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:11.260] a
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:11.480] group
[00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:12.590] closer
[00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.750] to
[00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:13.010] forming
[00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.270] now
[00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.410] is
[00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:13.710] because
[00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.890] we
[00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:14.070] could
[00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.310] just
[00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.930] assign
[00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:15.290] tasks
[00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:15.610] and
[00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:15.870] then
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.490] pick
[00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:17.650] up
[00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:17.910] on
[00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:18.350] the
[00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.710] information
[00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:19.170] and
[00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:19.770] mark
[00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:19.930] that
[00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:20.030] it
[00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:20.110] was
[00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.390] done
[00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.450] much
[00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.830] faster.
[00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.090] Yeah.
[00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.570] Because
[00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.050] we're
[00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:36.190] still
[00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.530] working
[00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.310] on
[00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.670] design
[00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:39.470] decisions.
[00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.130] All
[00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.610] right.
[00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:41.750] So
[00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.870] it's
[00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.030] big
[00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:42.390] decisions.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:44.840] How
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.020] big
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.100] are
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:45.240] those
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:45.400] two
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:45.700] teams?
[00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:47.770] Four
[00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:47.890] and
[00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:48.050] four?
[00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:48.850] OK.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.160] So
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.400] somebody
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:50.680] else,
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.080] next.
[00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.870] A
[00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:54.110] trigger
[00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.290] that
[00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:54.390] you
[00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.610] saw
[00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:54.830] that
[00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.230] made
[00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.350] you
[00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.470] go
[00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.650] from
[00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:55.830] one
[00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.030] stage
[00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:56.170] to
[00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:56.330] the
[00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.490] other.
[00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.070] I
[00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.310] think
[00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.910] we're
[00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:00.170] also
[00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:00.370] in
[00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:00.450] the
[00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:00.730] phase,
[00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:01.150] as
[00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:01.290] a
[00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:01.510] team,
[00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.670] where
[00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:01.770] we're
[00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:01.950] moving
[00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:02.130] from
[00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:02.370] sorting
[00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:02.630] to
[00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.910] learning.
[00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.830] And
[00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.310] part
[00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.410] of
[00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:06.810] that,
[00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:07.430] I
[00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.790] figure,
[00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.430] was
[00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.830] working
[00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.230] on
[00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.710] solidifying
[00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.930] our
[00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:12.130] game
[00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:12.330] idea.
[00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.830] Because
[00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:13.990] at
[00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.210] this
[00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.570] point,
[00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.050] while
[00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:15.250] we
[00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:15.450] all
[00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:15.870] recognize
[00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:16.030] our
[00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:16.370] vulnerability
[00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.790] as
[00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:16.930] a
[00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:17.330] team,
[00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:18.270] we
[00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.750] all
[00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:18.850] have
[00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:19.070] different
[00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.390] ideas.
[00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:19.750] Whether
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:21.700] we
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:21.840] are
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.300] solidifying
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:22.520] our
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:22.820] game,
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.000] we're
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.260] also
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:23.500] getting
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:23.920] ourselves
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.160] in
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.380] line
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:24.560] with
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:24.800] what
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:24.960] we're
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.240] actually
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:25.540] doing
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:25.720] and
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:25.880] how
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.000] we're
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.180] going
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:26.200] to
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:26.300] do
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:26.500] that.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.160] OK.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:28.300] Do
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:28.820] you
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.100] think
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:29.540] that
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.180] the
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:30.660] task
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:30.980] of
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.360] solidifying
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:31.520] the
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:31.680] game
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:31.880] idea
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.040] is
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:32.340] helping
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:32.720] you,
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:33.500] because
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:33.700] there's
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:33.820] this
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.060] big
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.440] decision
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:34.600] you
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:34.700] have
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:34.800] to
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:34.980] make,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.080] is
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.180] that
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:35.500] helping
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:35.820] you
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.680] work
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:37.860] as
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:37.980] a
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.160] team?
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:38.700] It's
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:38.840] not
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.000] getting
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.120] in
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.220] your
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:39.320] way?
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.080] I
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.340] think
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:40.540] it's
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:40.660] the
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:40.920] fact
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.120] that,
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:41.460] as
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:41.640] we're
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:41.840] doing
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.040] this,
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:42.200] we
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:42.340] have
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:42.460] a
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:42.740] lot
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:42.940] of,
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.440] we
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.600] don't
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:43.820] have
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.120] this
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:44.700] conflict
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.760] in
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:46.880] our
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.180] team
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:47.500] where
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.240] people
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:48.540] are
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.120] chatting
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:49.280] out
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:49.500] different
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:49.940] ideas
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:50.100] and
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:50.440] trying
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:50.580] to
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:50.720] work
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:50.920] through
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.160] it.
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:51.700] And
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:51.860] at
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.060] first,
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:52.240] we
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:52.420] weren't
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:52.560] doing
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:52.720] the
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:52.940] best
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:53.300] job
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:53.480] of
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:53.820] getting
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.100] those
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.460] ideas
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:54.620] and
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:54.820] working
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.080] through
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.380] them.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:55.960] But
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.140] I
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:56.300] see
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:56.540] that
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:56.880] now
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.120] we're
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.300] doing
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:57.420] a
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:57.580] much
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:57.780] better
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.100] job
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.260] of
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:58.600] understanding
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:58.840] each
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.040] other
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.240] and
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:20:59.640] seeing
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:20:59.900] how
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:20:59.960] it
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.080] fits
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.240] into
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:00.360] the
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:00.500] bigger
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:00.820] picture.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.440] OK.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.100] Next
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.340] team.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:04.820] A
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.120] triggering
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.460] moment
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:05.640] that
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:05.780] you
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.120] saw
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:06.500] in
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.580] this
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:07.800] team
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:07.900] or
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.200] previous
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:08.500] teams.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:09.520] So
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.360] we
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.200] had
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:11.500] a
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:11.760] bigger
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.100]-collar
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:12.340] team
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:12.480] at
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:12.800] first.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.300] And
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.500] I
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:13.720] think
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:13.960] that
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.520] having
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.260] the
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:15.560] size
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.000] split
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.500] up
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.040] was
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:17.220] the
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.020] way
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.180] that
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:18.340] helped
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:18.520] us
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:18.820] jump
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.260] from
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:19.800] forming
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:19.980] to
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.400] storming.
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.420] Because
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:22.620] we
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:22.840] needed
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.020] to
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.320] sort
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:23.440] of
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:23.900] storm
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.160] to
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:24.400] get
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.120] our
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:25.560] team
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:25.780] to
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:25.960] get
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.160] two
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.360] different
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:26.840] ideas.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:27.880] So
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.060] there
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:28.240] are
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:28.760] conflicting
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.060] ideas
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:30.220] in
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:30.380] terms
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:30.520] of
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:30.680] where
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:30.820] our
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:30.980] games
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.240] go
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:31.440] in
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:31.540] the
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:31.860] brainstorm
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:32.220] session.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.200] So
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:33.420] it's
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:33.660] basically
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:33.840] just,
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.120] it's
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:34.500] reducing
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.000] the
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.300] number
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:35.440] of
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:35.740] opinions,
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.220] really,
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:36.500] right?
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:42.920] My
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.120] math
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.380] is
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.200] killing
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:44.400] three
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:44.660] people.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:48.700] So
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.180] with
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:49.380] our
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:49.760] game,
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:50.260] I
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:50.520] think
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:50.960] getting
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.180] us
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:51.300] to
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:51.640] storming
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:51.780] was
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:52.080] really,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.480] they
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:52.700] talked
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:52.920] about
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.400] assigning
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.280] tasks,
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:54.880] but
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.100] also
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.360] just
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:55.520] the
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:55.980] accountability
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.560] aspect.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.420] Because
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.140] instead
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:58.300] of
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:58.560] spending
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.060] time
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.980] arguing,
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:00.240] we
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:00.360] already
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:00.560] had
[00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:01.110] a
[00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.390] designated
[00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.870] person
[00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:02.070] or
[00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.210] a
[00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.310] couple
[00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.790] people
[00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:03.590] who
[00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.890] are
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.360] things.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:06.160] Which
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:06.380] allows
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:06.580] us
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:06.720] to
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:06.920] just
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.240] kind
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:07.460] of
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:07.980] not
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.700] argue.
[00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:11.630] So
[00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.050] that's,
[00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:12.490] like,
[00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.830] certain
[00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:13.170] people
[00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:13.390] have
[00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.730] different,
[00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.230] like,
[00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.890] they
[00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:15.230] own
[00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.710] sub
[00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.010]-tasks
[00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.110] or
[00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.230] they
[00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.350] own
[00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.570] sub
[00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:16.790]-roles?
[00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.270] Yes.
[00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:17.570] OK.
[00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.390] Cool.
[00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:19.210] In
[00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:19.310] the
[00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.590] back?
[00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:20.730] What
[00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:20.750] do
[00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.770] you
[00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:20.990] think?
[00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:22.230] So
[00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.350] I
[00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.550] guess
[00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.050] what
[00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:23.330] got
[00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.690] us
[00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:24.250] over
[00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:24.570] to
[00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.150] storming
[00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:25.710] was
[00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.530] meeting
[00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:26.910] together
[00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:27.090] as
[00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:27.170] a
[00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:27.350] team
[00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.490] to
[00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:27.710] make
[00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.150] design
[00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:28.590] decisions.
[00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.890] Sort
[00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:29.050] of
[00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:29.630] what
[00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.790] has
[00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:29.930] been
[00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:30.150] said
[00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:30.350] there.
[00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:31.170] And
[00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:31.310] I
[00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.510] think
[00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.710] that
[00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.970] the
[00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:32.310] next
[00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.690] step
[00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:33.010] for
[00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:33.610] bringing
[00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:33.790] us
[00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:33.990] over
[00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.190] to
[00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.670] storming
[00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:35.230] would
[00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:35.410] be,
[00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.630] like,
[00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.970] actually
[00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:36.370] getting
[00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:36.950] everyone
[00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:37.310] to
[00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.010] participate
[00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:38.390] in
[00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.670] design
[00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:39.050] decisions.
[00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.370] Because,
[00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.630] like,
[00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.270] people
[00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.510] have
[00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.750] both
[00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.110] not
[00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.370] shown
[00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:42.630] up
[00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.830] and
[00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:43.030] not
[00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:43.430] particularly
[00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.850] shown
[00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:44.310] interest
[00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.650] in
[00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:44.890] getting
[00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:45.190] things
[00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.490] going.
[00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:46.050] So
[00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:46.290] getting
[00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:46.770] everyone
[00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:46.970] on
[00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:47.370] board,
[00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.710] even,
[00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.270] is
[00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:48.450] the
[00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:48.610] goal.
[00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.170] All
[00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:49.410] right.
[00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:50.330] So
[00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.510] that's
[00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.590] a
[00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.750] big
[00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.910] one.
[00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:51.270] That's
[00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.690] a
[00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:51.930] huge
[00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:52.370] difficulty,
[00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:53.770] especially
[00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:53.930] with
[00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:54.170] student
[00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:54.590] projects.
[00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:55.270] You've
[00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.410] got
[00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:55.790] all
[00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:55.930] these
[00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.070] other
[00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.390] things
[00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.630] going
[00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.910] on
[00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:57.170] around
[00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:57.410] you.
[00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:58.470] Do
[00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.650] you
[00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:58.970] think
[00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:59.150] you
[00:22:59.150 --> 00:22:59.390] need
[00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.170] everyone
[00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:00.710] to
[00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:01.210] contribute
[00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:01.410] to
[00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:01.530] the
[00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:01.930] design?
[00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:02.570] Or
[00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.710] do
[00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.810] you
[00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.970] need
[00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:03.390] everyone
[00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.730] to
[00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:03.910] be
[00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:04.070] on
[00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.290] board
[00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:04.450] with
[00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:04.570] the
[00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:04.850] design?
[00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.750] So
[00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:08.270] I
[00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.750] understand,
[00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:09.010] like,
[00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:09.210] some
[00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:09.450] people
[00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:09.730] just
[00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.190] are
[00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.010] less
[00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:11.490] interested
[00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:11.710] in
[00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:11.970] having
[00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:12.410] deep
[00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:12.870] discussions
[00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:13.130] about
[00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.330] the
[00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:13.670] design
[00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:13.830] of
[00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.930] the
[00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:14.190] game.
[00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.990] But
[00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.490] getting
[00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:15.890] everyone
[00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:16.130] to
[00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.370] both
[00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.670] be
[00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:17.170] aware
[00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:17.610] and
[00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:18.170] willing
[00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:18.450] to
[00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:18.910] participate
[00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:19.210] when
[00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:19.370] they
[00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.650] need
[00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:19.890] to.
[00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.210] OK.
[00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:20.910] Because,
[00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:21.030] yeah,
[00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:21.550] there's
[00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:21.890] important
[00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:22.410] conversations
[00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.030] being
[00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:23.350] done.
[00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.930] That
[00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:24.050] if
[00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:24.150] they're
[00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:24.270] not
[00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:24.830] there
[00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:25.010] when
[00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.130] it
[00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.470] happens,
[00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.670] they're
[00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:25.810] not
[00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:25.910] going
[00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:26.010] to
[00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:26.250] know
[00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:26.530] where
[00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:26.710] the
[00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.950] status
[00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:27.070] of
[00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.150] the
[00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:27.310] game
[00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.590] is.
[00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:28.190] Yeah.
[00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.510] And
[00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.730] they
[00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.890] just
[00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:29.030] need
[00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:29.110] to
[00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.250] be,
[00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:29.390] like,
[00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.750] willing
[00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.010] to
[00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:30.390] participate.
[00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:30.710] Like,
[00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.970] if
[00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:31.090] they're
[00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:31.270] not
[00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.570] there,
[00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.890] take
[00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:32.070] the
[00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.330] step
[00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.530] of,
[00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:32.750] oh,
[00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:32.950] why
[00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.990] don't
[00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.070] you
[00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.250] guys
[00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:33.510] talk
[00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.710] about,
[00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.930] I'm
[00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:34.250] interested
[00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.490] in
[00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.670] knowing
[00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:34.870] I
[00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:35.130] want
[00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:35.250] to.
[00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.990] OK.
[00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:36.310] Cool.
[00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.370] Thank
[00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.510] you
[00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.650] for
[00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:37.930] that
[00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:38.330] lead,
[00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:38.650] because
[00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:38.790] that
[00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:38.990] gets
[00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.130] us
[00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:39.270] to
[00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.410] our
[00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:39.710] next
[00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.630] stage.
[00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:41.050] So
[00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:41.850] we're
[00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.150] talking,
[00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.370] like,
[00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.510] we're
[00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.770] talking
[00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:43.070] kind
[00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.330] of,
[00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:44.570] I
[00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.710] think
[00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.810] we
[00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:45.030] find
[00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:45.250] ourselves
[00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:45.590] talking
[00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.750] a
[00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.890] lot
[00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:46.170] about
[00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:46.530] the
[00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:47.950] product
[00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:48.170] that
[00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:48.290] we're
[00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:48.630] making.
[00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.350] It's
[00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.490] just
[00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.830] easier.
[00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:50.430] It's
[00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.530] the
[00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:50.730] thing.
[00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:50.950] It's
[00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.430] that
[00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.770] hard,
[00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:52.330] evident,
[00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.750] like,
[00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.210] that
[00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.410] hard
[00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:53.590] thing
[00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.690] you
[00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.830] can
[00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:54.010] see.
[00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:54.210] Like,
[00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:54.510] it's
[00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.770] being
[00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.030] made.
[00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:55.230] It's
[00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.430] being
[00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.750] done.
[00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:57.410] We
[00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:57.570] can
[00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:57.830] play
[00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:58.050] it.
[00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.650] It
[00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:58.830] means
[00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.110] we're
[00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.310] probably
[00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.490] doing
[00:23:59.490 --> 00:23:59.750] something
[00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.030] right.
[00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:00.830] But
[00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.990] it's
[00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.130] still
[00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.310] very
[00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.610] difficult,
[00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.930] still,
[00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:02.070] to
[00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.250] talk
[00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:02.490] about
[00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:02.690] the
[00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:02.970] people.
[00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:03.730] Although
[00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:03.870] I
[00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:04.010] saw
[00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.530] being
[00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:04.850] talking
[00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:04.970] about
[00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:05.050] the
[00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:05.230] people
[00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.370] a
[00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:05.470] little
[00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.610] bit
[00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:05.750] here,
[00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:06.030] especially
[00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:06.290] with
[00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.210] accountability.
[00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:08.010] And
[00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:08.430] this
[00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.610] one
[00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:09.230] was
[00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.450] good.
[00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.850] Cool.
[00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:12.950] So
[00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:13.350] that
[00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.730] brings
[00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.810] me
[00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:13.870] to
[00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.990] the
[00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.150] next
[00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:14.470] topic.
[00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:15.310] Teams
[00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.530] are
[00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:15.850] composed
[00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:16.070] of
[00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.490] individuals.
[00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:16.810] And
[00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.090] each
[00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.510] person
[00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.650] on
[00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:17.770] your
[00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:17.990] team
[00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.150] is
[00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:18.230] going
[00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.310] to
[00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.490] have
[00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:18.670] a
[00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:18.830] lot
[00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.930] of
[00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:19.170] different
[00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:19.590] factors
[00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.070] affecting
[00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.750] what
[00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.910] they
[00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:21.150] do,
[00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:21.390] how
[00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.570] they
[00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:21.730] do
[00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:21.870] it,
[00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:22.090] when
[00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:22.230] they
[00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.410] do
[00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:22.570] it.
[00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.390] I
[00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.690] can't
[00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.870] give
[00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:24.010] you
[00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:24.410] the
[00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:24.870] magic
[00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:25.290] formula
[00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:25.630] to
[00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.070] get
[00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.270] them
[00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.670] motivated.
[00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:27.450] What
[00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:27.570] I
[00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:27.850] can
[00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:28.130] do
[00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.490] is
[00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:28.790] show
[00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.110] you
[00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.890] some
[00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:29.990] of
[00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.070] the
[00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.290] different
[00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:30.670] ways
[00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:30.810] that
[00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:30.890] you
[00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:31.050] can
[00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:31.390] then
[00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:31.750] try
[00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:32.030] to
[00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:32.710] either
[00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:33.530] understand
[00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:33.730] the
[00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:33.930] people
[00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:34.130] you're
[00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.410] with,
[00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:35.210] understand
[00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.390] the
[00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.570] people
[00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.710] on
[00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:35.810] your
[00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:36.050] team,
[00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.210] or
[00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:36.770] find
[00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:37.050] things
[00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:37.190] to
[00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.330] talk
[00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:37.450] to
[00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:37.570] them
[00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:37.770] about.
[00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:38.290] You
[00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:38.490] might
[00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:39.090] notice
[00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:39.210] a
[00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:39.350] number
[00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.490] of
[00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:39.630] these
[00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.930] things.
[00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:41.070] So
[00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.170] to
[00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:41.310] get
[00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.530] someone
[00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:41.690] who's
[00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.050] motivated,
[00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:42.370] someone
[00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:42.510] who's
[00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.610] going
[00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:42.650] to
[00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:42.890] be
[00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:43.390] able
[00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:43.530] to
[00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:43.910] participate,
[00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:45.670] think
[00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:45.830] about
[00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.950] all
[00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:46.150] these
[00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:46.370] things.
[00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:46.590] Think
[00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.790] about
[00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.130] personal
[00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:47.550] development.
[00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.750] So
[00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.150] you're
[00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:50.270] in
[00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.390] a
[00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.750] class.
[00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.010] You're
[00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:51.250] here,
[00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.870] hopefully,
[00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.130] because
[00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.270] you
[00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:52.390] want
[00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.490] to
[00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.690] learn.
[00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.370] You
[00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:53.510] want
[00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.590] to
[00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.730] learn
[00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:53.830] a
[00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.950] new
[00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:54.210] skill.
[00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:54.390] You
[00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.490] want
[00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:54.590] to
[00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.870] try
[00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.990] a
[00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.130] new
[00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.390] skill.
[00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:56.190] Everyone
[00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.510] wants
[00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.670] to
[00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:56.790] learn
[00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:56.890] a
[00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:57.010] new
[00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:57.230] skill.
[00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:57.430] There
[00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.690] might
[00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:57.870] be
[00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:58.010] a
[00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.230] skill
[00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.410] that
[00:24:58.410 --> 00:24:58.550] they
[00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:58.710] want
[00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.810] to
[00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:58.970] work
[00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:59.150] on
[00:24:59.150 --> 00:24:59.290] on
[00:24:59.290 --> 00:24:59.410] your
[00:24:59.410 --> 00:24:59.630] team.
[00:24:59.670 --> 00:24:59.730] And
[00:24:59.730 --> 00:24:59.810] I
[00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.910] think
[00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:00.050] we've
[00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:00.190] talked
[00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.390] about
[00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.530] that
[00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:00.630] in
[00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.710] the
[00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.010] past
[00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.530] when
[00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:01.610] we
[00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.630] were
[00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:01.870] talking
[00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:02.090] about
[00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.270] the
[00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.470] vision
[00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.830] statement
[00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:03.510] and
[00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.730] people
[00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:03.970] putting
[00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:04.270] down
[00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:04.790] why
[00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:05.130] they're
[00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:05.470] involved
[00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.630] on
[00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.730] the
[00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:05.930] team
[00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:06.050] and
[00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:06.230] why
[00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.430] they're
[00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.670] involved
[00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:06.790] in
[00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:06.910] this
[00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:07.330] project.
[00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.930] So
[00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:08.130] being
[00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:08.330] aware
[00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.430] of
[00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.530] that
[00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:08.710] and
[00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:09.090] constantly
[00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:09.390] coming
[00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:09.590] back
[00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.710] to
[00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.850] that
[00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:09.990] for
[00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.110] each
[00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.430] person,
[00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:11.150] especially
[00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:11.410] if
[00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:11.770] you
[00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:12.010] have
[00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:12.330] someone
[00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:12.490] on
[00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:12.570] your
[00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:12.710] team
[00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:13.390] who
[00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:13.530] is
[00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:13.750] just
[00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.930] not
[00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:14.290] participating
[00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:14.530] and
[00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:14.610] you
[00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:14.710] need
[00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.810] to
[00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.950] figure
[00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:15.270] out
[00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.670] how
[00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:16.810] to
[00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:17.090] engage
[00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.370] them.
[00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:18.510] Think
[00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.690] about
[00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:18.830] the
[00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:19.030] skills
[00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:19.150] that
[00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:19.270] they
[00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:19.410] want
[00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:19.510] to
[00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.630] bring
[00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.730] to
[00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.850] the
[00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:20.050] table,
[00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:20.210] the
[00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.430] skills
[00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.550] they're
[00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:20.710] trying
[00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.830] to
[00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.190] practice.
[00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.630] When
[00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.690] it
[00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:22.830] comes
[00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.930] to
[00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:23.370] motivation,
[00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.150] it
[00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:25.410] largely
[00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:25.710] comes
[00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.890] down
[00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:26.050] to
[00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:26.550] intrinsic
[00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:26.810] or
[00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:27.310] extrinsic.
[00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.990] The
[00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.830] extrinsic
[00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:29.050] might
[00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:29.190] be
[00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.310] the
[00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.550] grade
[00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:29.770] they're
[00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:29.870] going
[00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.930] to
[00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:30.150] get,
[00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:30.850] but
[00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:31.030] it's
[00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:31.430] really
[00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.830] difficult
[00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.410] to
[00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.730] really
[00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.950] hone
[00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.050] in
[00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:35.170] on
[00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:35.370] that
[00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:35.730] because
[00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:35.970] the
[00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:36.170] grades
[00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:36.510] shared
[00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.970] between
[00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:37.130] your
[00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.350] groups.
[00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.470] So
[00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.570] that
[00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:37.750] might
[00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.090] not
[00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.250] be
[00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:38.370] the
[00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:38.550] place
[00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:38.670] to
[00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:38.810] look
[00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:38.990] at.
[00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.830] Try
[00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.930] to
[00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:40.050] take
[00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:40.150] a
[00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:40.230] look
[00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.310] at
[00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.430] the
[00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.750] intrinsic
[00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:41.170] things.
[00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:41.830] What
[00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.970] are
[00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:42.070] the
[00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.290] things
[00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:42.410] that,
[00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.590] if
[00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.410] they
[00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:44.590] had
[00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:45.450] enthusiasms
[00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.110] about
[00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.270] the
[00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:46.590] project
[00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.850] at
[00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:47.110] some
[00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.450] point,
[00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:48.950] try
[00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:49.390] to
[00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:49.670] remember
[00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:49.910] what
[00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:50.090] that
[00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.530] was.
[00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.790] Ask
[00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.010] somebody
[00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.170] else
[00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:52.250] on
[00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.330] your
[00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:52.510] team
[00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.730] what
[00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:53.110] that
[00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.270] might
[00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:53.390] have
[00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.630] been.
[00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.210] See
[00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:54.330] if
[00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:54.410] you
[00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:54.530] can
[00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:54.770] bring
[00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:55.470] that
[00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.890] enthusiasm
[00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:56.210] back
[00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.370] into
[00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:56.470] the

[00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.970] self
[00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:59.310]-worth.
[00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.770] There's
[00:25:59.770 --> 00:25:59.870] been
[00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:00.090] some
[00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.410] research
[00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:00.610] that
[00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:00.950] shows
[00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.670] that
[00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:01.890] the
[00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:02.110] reason
[00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.490] why
[00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:02.870] people
[00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.170] work
[00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:03.350] well
[00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.510] on
[00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.710] teams
[00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.870] and
[00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:03.990] the
[00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.130] reason
[00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.290] why
[00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:04.410] we
[00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:04.590] want
[00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.710] to
[00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.870] work

[00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.690] So
[00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:26.010] it's
[00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:26.250] good

[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:29.520] run
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:29.640] a
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:29.680] rule
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:29.820] to

[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:34.560] this.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.140] It's
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:35.420] kind
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:35.460] of

[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:35.640] a
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:35.860] hybrid.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:37.460] So
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:37.620] where
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:37.780] does
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:37.960] ownership

[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.060] Absolutely.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:48.360] So
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:48.560] there's
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:48.720] some.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.000] So
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.220] at
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:04.340] the
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:04.640] beginning,
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:05.540] everybody
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:05.820] takes
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:05.960] on
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.260] tasks.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:06.380] And
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:06.480] at
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:06.580] the
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:06.760] end,
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:06.960] when
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.040] you
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.160] have
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.280] the
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:07.640] leftovers,
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:08.560] they
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:08.660] get
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:08.920] assigned.
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:09.560] Yeah,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:09.740] Matt?
[00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:28.290] So
[00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:28.610] you
[00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:29.310] might
[00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.410] not
[00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:29.630] actually
[00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.810] have
[00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:30.050] ownership.
[00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:30.230] It
[00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.350] might
[00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.550] look
[00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:30.710] like
[00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.790] you
[00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:30.910] had
[00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:31.150] ownership.
[00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:31.990] There
[00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.110] is
[00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.290] the
[00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:32.550] evidence
[00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:32.710] of
[00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.950] ownership
[00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:33.130] in
[00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:33.270] that
[00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:33.550] someone
[00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:33.850] said,
[00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:34.050] OK,
[00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.170] I'll
[00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:34.330] take
[00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:34.490] that
[00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.890] task.
[00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.570] But
[00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:35.810] there's
[00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:36.130] no
[00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:36.930] follow
[00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:37.110] through.
[00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:37.870] There's
[00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.990] no
[00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.270] commitment.
[00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:39.030] And
[00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.130] that
[00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:39.270] gets
[00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:39.390] to
[00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:39.490] the
[00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:39.670] next
[00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:39.970] one,
[00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.430] commitment.
[00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:42.530] The
[00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:42.990] best
[00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.350] way
[00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.690] to
[00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:44.010] have
[00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:44.430] commitment
[00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.670] on
[00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:44.810] your
[00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:45.070] team
[00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.250] is
[00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:45.390] for
[00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:45.630] one
[00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.870] person
[00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:46.010] to
[00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.170] be
[00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:46.450] committed
[00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.370] to
[00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:47.770] express
[00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:48.010] that
[00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:48.370] commitment,
[00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.970] to
[00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:49.230] express
[00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.470] that
[00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.810] loyalty,
[00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:50.390] for
[00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:50.650] everyone
[00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:50.830] else
[00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.990] to
[00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.250] see
[00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:51.510] that
[00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.810] loyalty
[00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:52.090] and
[00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:52.230] see
[00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.430] that
[00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.730] commitment.
[00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:53.710] And
[00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.890] then
[00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:54.230] hopefully,
[00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:54.510] they
[00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:54.690] pick
[00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:54.810] up
[00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:54.910] the
[00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:55.050] ball.
[00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.150] And
[00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:55.270] they're
[00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:55.450] like,
[00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.630] OK,
[00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:55.790] I'm
[00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:55.830] going
[00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.830] to
[00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.950] be
[00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:56.170] committed
[00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:56.390] too.
[00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:57.270] If
[00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:57.470] that
[00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.730] second
[00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:58.030] person
[00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:58.310] doesn't
[00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.490] do
[00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:58.750] that,
[00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.470] pick
[00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.570] it
[00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.770] up.
[00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.090] Then
[00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:00.550] it
[00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:00.830] doesn't
[00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:01.190] travel
[00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.390] through
[00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:01.530] the
[00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:01.770] chain.
[00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:02.230] It
[00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.350] just
[00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:02.570] doesn't
[00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:02.890] happen.
[00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:03.970] Even
[00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:04.150] though
[00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:04.290] that
[00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:04.430] one
[00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.670] person
[00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:04.830] went
[00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.970] out
[00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:05.070] of
[00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.130] their
[00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:05.330] way
[00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.630] to
[00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.930] show
[00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:06.070] that
[00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.210] kind
[00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:06.270] of
[00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:06.670] sacrifice,
[00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:06.810] it
[00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:06.950] just
[00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.110] didn't
[00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.250] get
[00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.450] picked
[00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:07.630] up.
[00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:08.590] So
[00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:08.790] maybe
[00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.010] think
[00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:09.270] about,
[00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.710] do
[00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.990] you
[00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.170] see
[00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:11.350] that
[00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.590] chain
[00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.950] happening
[00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:12.150] on
[00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:12.290] your
[00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.010] teams?
[00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:13.650] Do
[00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:13.750] you
[00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.890] see
[00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:14.010] it
[00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:14.270] breaking?
[00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.990] Can
[00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.090] you
[00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:15.470] identify
[00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.770] where
[00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:15.970] that
[00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:16.210] breaking
[00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:16.470] point
[00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.650] is?
[00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.750] And
[00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.930] can
[00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:17.030] you
[00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:17.510] think
[00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.770] about
[00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:18.130] ways
[00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:18.550] to
[00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:18.930] fix
[00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:19.130] that?
[00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:21.230] Trust
[00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.550] is
[00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:21.650] a
[00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:21.790] big
[00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:22.050] one.
[00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.110] So
[00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.370] raise
[00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:24.530] your
[00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:24.930] hands
[00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:25.290] if
[00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:25.790] you
[00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:26.250] have
[00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:26.630] worked
[00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.850] with
[00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:26.950] the
[00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:27.230] majority
[00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.430] of
[00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.530] the
[00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:27.950] people
[00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:28.270] on
[00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:28.430] your
[00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.710] team
[00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:29.090] before
[00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.830] in
[00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.110] some
[00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.550] fashion,
[00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:31.650] this
[00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:31.930] class
[00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:32.010] or
[00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:32.170] other
[00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:32.430] classes.
[00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.570] You
[00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:33.170] feel
[00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:33.290] like
[00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:33.390] you
[00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:33.550] know
[00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:33.730] your
[00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:34.210] teammates.
[00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.230] Raise
[00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.350] your
[00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.510] hands
[00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.590] if
[00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.690] you
[00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.830] feel
[00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.930] like
[00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:36.030] you
[00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:36.210] really
[00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:36.350] know
[00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.490] your
[00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:36.730] teammates,
[00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:36.930] you've
[00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:37.070] worked
[00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.190] with
[00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.290] them
[00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:37.570] before.
[00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.590] High
[00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.750] if
[00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.850] you
[00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:39.070] really
[00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.270] think
[00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:39.450] so.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:40.840] So
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.100] one,
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:41.660] two,
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:42.420] maybe,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:43.860] one,
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.200] two,
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:44.900] three.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.320] So
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:47.680] think
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:47.880] about
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.040] how
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:48.180] well
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:48.280] you
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:48.440] know
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:48.620] each
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:48.820] other.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:49.500] Think
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:49.680] about
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:49.940] ways
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:50.060] you
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:50.180] can
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:50.400] figure
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:50.660] out
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:50.920] how
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.060] you
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:51.160] can
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.280] know
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:51.400] each
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:51.540] other
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:51.860] better.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.080] Social
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.440] interactions,
[00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.330] going
[00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.450] out
[00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.550] to
[00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:56.850] coffee,
[00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:57.150] going
[00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:57.250] out
[00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:57.390] for
[00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:57.630] lunch,
[00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.870] things
[00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:58.070] like
[00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.310] that.
[00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.470] Is
[00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.570] there
[00:29:58.570 --> 00:29:58.830] something
[00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.010] that
[00:29:59.010 --> 00:29:59.110] you
[00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.270] can
[00:29:59.270 --> 00:29:59.570] do
[00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.350] that
[00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.650] will
[00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:01.150] help
[00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:01.290] that
[00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:01.870] kind
[00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.950] of
[00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:02.050] thing
[00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:02.530] happen?
[00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:02.870] And
[00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:03.330] then
[00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:03.530] here's
[00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:03.610] the
[00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:03.770] big
[00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:03.990] one.
[00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.250] This
[00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.430] is
[00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.590] the
[00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.870] MIT
[00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.130] one,
[00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:05.610] stress.
[00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:06.530] And
[00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:06.730] stress
[00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:06.930] tends
[00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:07.090] to
[00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:07.250] be
[00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.430] the
[00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:08.130] negative.
[00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.350] It
[00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.450] can
[00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.590] be
[00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.050] positive
[00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:09.650] in
[00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:09.850] that
[00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:10.170] it's
[00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:10.350] the
[00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.550] end
[00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:10.630] of
[00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.710] the
[00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:11.130] project
[00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:11.690] and
[00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.850] it's
[00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:12.070] due
[00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.730] and
[00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:12.810] you
[00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:12.890] just
[00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:13.050] need
[00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:13.130] to
[00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.230] get
[00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.470] things
[00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.790] done.
[00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.550] And
[00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:14.650] that
[00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:14.750] can
[00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.310] lead
[00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.430] to
[00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.770] crunch.
[00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.150] But
[00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:16.250] then
[00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.410] there's
[00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:16.570] also
[00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:16.730] the
[00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.890] huge
[00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:17.150] negative
[00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:17.470] aspect
[00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.650] of
[00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:17.930] stress.
[00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:18.070] And
[00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.270] that's
[00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:18.990] very
[00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.170] much
[00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:19.270] an
[00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:19.510] external
[00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.890] factor
[00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:20.070] for
[00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.170] the
[00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:20.290] most
[00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.010] part.
[00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:21.510] It
[00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.710] could
[00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.850] be
[00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:21.930] an
[00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:22.210] internal
[00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:22.670] factor.
[00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:24.070] If
[00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.450] there's
[00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:24.610] some
[00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.190] stress
[00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.430] being
[00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.710] caused
[00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.870] by
[00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:26.250] internal
[00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.290] things
[00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:27.490] going
[00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:27.650] on
[00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:27.770] with
[00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:27.850] your
[00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:28.090] team,
[00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.370] it's
[00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.650] likely
[00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:29.090] related
[00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.310] to
[00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.430] one
[00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.510] of
[00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.610] the
[00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:29.750] ones
[00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.950] above
[00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:30.150] it.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:33.720] So
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:33.820] yeah,
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:33.900] so
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.040] one
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:34.140] way
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:34.240] to
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:34.400] think
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:34.640] about
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.180] these
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:35.780] three,
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.100] one,
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:37.220] two,
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:37.420] three,
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:37.720] seven
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.180] things,
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:38.920] you
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.020] can
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.200] think
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:39.320] of
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:39.420] them
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:39.600] as
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:39.760] in
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.040] terms
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:40.360] of
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:40.800] the
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.100] desired
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:41.380] ability
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:41.540] to
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:41.700] learn
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:41.880] new
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.200] skills
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:42.520] or
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:42.680] the
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:42.980] desired
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:43.520] ability
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:43.700] to
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:43.880] take
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:43.980] on
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:44.100] a
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:44.480] task.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:45.640] So
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:45.720] if
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:45.820] you're
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:45.920] trying
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.000] to
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.120] come
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.220] up
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:46.320] with
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:46.600] strategies
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:46.780] with
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:46.860] your
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:47.120] team
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:47.240] on
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:47.400] how
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:47.580] to
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.100] solve
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.260] some
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:48.340] of
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:48.440] these
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:48.800] problems,
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.420] think
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:49.520] of
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:49.580] it
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:49.660] in
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:49.820] those
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.000] two
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:50.260] terms.
[00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:53.890] All
[00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:54.110] right.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:56.420] So
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:56.780] how
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.000] do
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:57.400] distributed
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:57.840] teams
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.420] perform?
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:30:59.540] So
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:30:59.680] what
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:30:59.740] do
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:30:59.840] I
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:30:59.960] mean
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.100] by
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:00.440] distributed?
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:02.120] What
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:02.240] is
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:02.360] a
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:02.620] distributed
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.000] team?
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:10.460] Yeah,
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:10.940] or
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.500] just
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:11.960] everyone's
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.180] all
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:12.340] over
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:12.460] the
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:12.680] place.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:12.820] It
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:12.960] could
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.240] mean
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:13.440] that
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:13.640] you
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:13.940] are
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.680] in
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.140] Singapore
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:15.520] and
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:15.720] someone
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:15.980] else
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.240] is
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:16.780] in
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.300] Ohio.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:18.600] You
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:18.700] could
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:18.860] be
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:19.140] separated
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:19.340] by
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:19.620] time
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:19.920] zones,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.120] by
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:20.600] oceans,
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.080] by,
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:22.480] and
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:22.700] really
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:22.900] I
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:23.060] think
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:23.260] that
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:23.400] might
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:23.580] be
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:23.780] East
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:24.180] Campus
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:24.340] in
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:24.700] McGregor
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:24.960] maybe.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.240] It
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:27.340] could
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:27.460] just
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:27.560] be
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:27.700] through
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.040] distance.
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:28.200] It
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:28.300] could
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:28.560] be
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:28.820] through
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.040] your
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.360] schools.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:29.660] It
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:29.780] could
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:29.940] be
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.100] through
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:30.220] your
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:30.560] departments,
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:30.760] your
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.000] majors,
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:31.240] whatnot.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:32.860] There's
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:33.120] some
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:33.460] kind
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:33.620] of
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.000] boundaries
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.320] going
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:34.600] on
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:34.880] between
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.320] people.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:36.480] In
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:36.600] this
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:36.780] case,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.320] it's
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:37.540] largely
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:37.940] time.
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:39.180] It's
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:39.500] basically
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:39.900] some
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.060] people
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:40.220] can
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:40.400] work
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:40.600] during
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:40.840] some
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.060] hours.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:41.260] Some
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:41.460] people
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.060] can't
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:42.200] work
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:42.380] during
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:42.540] those
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:43.200] other
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.520] hours.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.400] So
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:44.660] what
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:44.760] have
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:44.860] you
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:45.020] done
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.240] so
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:45.580] far
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.140] to
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.860] fix
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.080] that?
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.000] Think
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.260] back
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:48.380] on
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:48.480] some
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:48.540] of
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:48.640] the
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.060] postmortems
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:49.240] you've
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:49.380] given
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:49.660] us.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.200] What
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:50.300] are
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:50.440] some
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:50.520] of
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:50.620] the
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:50.980] strategies
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.360] you've
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:51.680] already
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.180] used
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.340] and
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:52.600] seen
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.060] used
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:53.960] to
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.020] figure
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.120] out
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:55.220] how
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:55.320] to
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:55.520] work
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.720] across
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.000] different
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:57.280] time
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:57.820] periods?
[00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:10.370] What's
[00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:10.410] it
[00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:10.550] called?
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.320] It's
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:13.440] like
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:13.580] what?
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:15.500] What's
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:15.700] that?
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:17.500] Yay.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:23.280] Cool.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:23.660] Anybody
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:23.900] else
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:24.080] using
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.220] a
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:24.360] group
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:24.600] IM
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:24.980] or
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:25.100] an
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:25.400] IRC
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:25.680] chat?
[00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:28.370] Yeah?
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.000] It's
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.180] great
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:42.300] when
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:42.960] it
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.060] can
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:43.200] hook
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:43.320] up
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:43.420] to
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:43.600] things
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:43.720] and
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:43.800] it
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:43.940] works
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.040] with
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:44.120] your
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:44.400] workflow.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:44.960] It's
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.120] also
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:45.280] just
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:45.420] great
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:45.540] to
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:45.760] have
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:45.980] this
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.240] period.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:46.580] If
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:46.660] you
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:46.800] don't
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:46.940] use
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.060] any
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.160] of
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:47.300] those,
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:47.500] maybe
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:47.720] think
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:47.900] about
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.120] Skype.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:48.320] Any
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:48.600] other
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.440] things
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:49.640] people
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:49.840] use?
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:50.020] Yeah?
[00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.650] So
[00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:12.030] reporting.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:16.340] I
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:16.520] remember
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:16.760] some
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:16.940] people
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.100] had
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:17.300] issues
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:17.480] with
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.860] email
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:18.220] on
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:18.520] previous
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:18.860] teams.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:19.440] Is
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.580] anybody
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:19.880] still
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.180] using
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:20.500] email
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:20.640] as
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:20.740] a
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.000] primary
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.300] means
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:21.420] of
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:21.820] communication
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:22.020] on
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:22.120] your
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:22.300] team?
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:24.640] How's
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:24.720] it
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:24.940] working
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:25.100] for
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.200] you
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:25.320] all
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:25.860] so
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:26.080] far?
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:34.300] Yep.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:35.520] Are
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:35.820] those
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.160] emails
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.320] going
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:36.340] to
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:36.480] be
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:36.960] archived
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.140] and
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:37.440] viewable
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:37.640] by
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:37.960] everyone
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.140] at
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:38.240] a
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:38.360] later
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:38.640] date?
[00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:44.050] I
[00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:44.230] think
[00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.510] that's
[00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:44.750] why
[00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.930] we
[00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:45.130] tend
[00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:45.430] to
[00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.970] think
[00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:46.270] about
[00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:47.710] group
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.280] IMs,
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:48.360] and
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:48.720] particularly,
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:49.300] Philip
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:49.520] likes
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:49.880] IRC.
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:50.460] For
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:50.580] that
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:50.760] very
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.000] reason,
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:51.300] certain
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:51.660] IRC
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.060] servers
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:52.280] will
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:52.640] keep
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:52.740] an
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:52.960] archive
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.260] for
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:53.420] you.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.240] Other
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:54.460] kinds
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:54.580] of
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:54.900] groupware
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.040] will
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.160] do
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.340] that,
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:55.560] too,
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:55.740] but
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:55.860] they
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:55.960] tend
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.040] to
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.220] be
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:56.720] pricey.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.260] Has

[00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:17.010] Because
[00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:17.110] I
[00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:17.230] think
[00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.550] it
[00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.670] can
[00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:17.790] do
[00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:18.010] email
[00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:18.510] notifications
[00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.710] and
[00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.870] things
[00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.010] like
[00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.190] that
[00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.310] when
[00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.510] things
[00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.870] change.
[00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:20.570] Assigning
[00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.870] members
[00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:21.030] to
[00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.270] tasks,
[00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:21.550] stuff
[00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:21.710] like
[00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.950] that.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:26.980] All
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:27.120] right.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:27.560] So
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:27.900] again,
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:28.080] we
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:28.220] got
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:28.580] talking
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:28.860] into
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.000] tools.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.300] What
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:31.500] other
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:31.740] things
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:31.880] can
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:31.960] we
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.100] do?
[00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.950] So
[00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:34.370] another
[00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.010] paper
[00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:35.210] that
[00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:35.310] is
[00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.410] going
[00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:35.470] to
[00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.550] be
[00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.670] on
[00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:35.870] Stellar,
[00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:35.970] if
[00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:36.030] you
[00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.130] want
[00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:36.190] to
[00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.310] look
[00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.430] at
[00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.670] it,
[00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:37.190] was
[00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.650] basically
[00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:38.310] a
[00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.650] survey
[00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:39.530] of
[00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.190] distributed
[00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.690] teams
[00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:41.050] using
[00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:41.310] agile
[00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.730] processes
[00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:42.170] and
[00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:42.370] giving
[00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:42.510] up
[00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:42.650] some
[00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:42.830] best
[00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:43.210] practices
[00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:43.510] of
[00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.650] what
[00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:43.870] worked
[00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:44.250] best
[00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:44.430] for
[00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.610] them.
[00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:45.430] And
[00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.630] I
[00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:45.750] was
[00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.990] nice,
[00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.110] and
[00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:46.250] I'm
[00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.370] just
[00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:46.550] giving
[00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.830] you
[00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:47.090] the
[00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:47.710] summary
[00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.850] of
[00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:47.990] that.
[00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.890] So
[00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:50.090] one
[00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:50.270] thing
[00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.410] they
[00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:50.670] noticed
[00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:50.970] is
[00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:51.270] having
[00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.430] a
[00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.730] one
[00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:52.030] team
[00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.530] mindset
[00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:53.070] was
[00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:53.230] the
[00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.390] thing
[00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:53.530] that
[00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:53.670] got
[00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:53.850] them
[00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:54.210] through
[00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.170] working
[00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:55.530] together
[00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:55.690] as
[00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:55.770] a
[00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:55.950] group.
[00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:57.570] What
[00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:57.970] do
[00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:58.070] we
[00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.210] mean
[00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:58.330] by
[00:34:58.330 --> 00:34:58.610] one
[00:34:58.610 --> 00:34:59.070] team?
[00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:00.310] That
[00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.750] the
[00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:01.250] group
[00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.830] identifies,
[00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:02.230] well,
[00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.390] first
[00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.490] it
[00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:02.810] identifies
[00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.990] as
[00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.130] a
[00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:03.390] team,
[00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:03.630] like
[00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.710] we
[00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.930] talked
[00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:04.090] about
[00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:04.390] before.
[00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.570] They
[00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:04.770] all
[00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:04.970] have
[00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:05.430] a
[00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.950] goal
[00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:06.110] that
[00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:06.250] they're
[00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:06.470] going
[00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.810] towards.
[00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:07.010] They
[00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.150] all
[00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.510] identify
[00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.810] as
[00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:07.990] going
[00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.250] towards
[00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:08.390] that
[00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.630] goal.
[00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.810] They
[00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:10.050] don't
[00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:10.530] identify
[00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:11.050] as
[00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:11.250] just
[00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:11.810] an
[00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:12.190] individual
[00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.490] group.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.440] But
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:14.880] that's
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.140] actually
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:15.280] a
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:15.400] major
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:15.660] part
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:15.740] of
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:15.860] their
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.220] identity.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:17.800] And
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.240] for
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:18.420] them,
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:18.600] it's
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:18.820] because
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.140] that's
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:19.360] their
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:19.660] 40
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:19.920] hour,
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:20.300] 80
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:20.620] hour,
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:21.660] 120
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.040] hour
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:22.760] work
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:23.080] days,
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:23.700] or
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.080] work
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:24.360] weeks.
[00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:26.710] Something
[00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.890] I
[00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:27.010] think
[00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:27.430] you're
[00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.510] going
[00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.550] to
[00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:27.650] have
[00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.750] an
[00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.930] issue
[00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:28.110] with,
[00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:28.310] because
[00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.150] you're
[00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.370] working
[00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:30.110] smaller
[00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:30.370] periods
[00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:30.470] of
[00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.670] time.
[00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.810] But
[00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:31.970] what
[00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:32.110] they're
[00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:32.230] able
[00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.350] to
[00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:32.530] do,
[00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:32.810] the
[00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.950] way
[00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:33.110] they're
[00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:33.230] able
[00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.350] to
[00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:33.450] do
[00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:33.670] that
[00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.870] is
[00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:34.030] they've
[00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.130] got
[00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.250] these
[00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.470] frequent
[00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.710] team
[00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:35.050] interactions.
[00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.310] And
[00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.590] actually,
[00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:36.150] when
[00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.290] they're
[00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.550] working
[00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.770] for
[00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:36.870] a
[00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.990] long
[00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.170] period
[00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:37.290] of
[00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:37.470] time,
[00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.630] there
[00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.710] are
[00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.930] people
[00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:39.090] who
[00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:39.190] are
[00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.510] working
[00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.750] on
[00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.870] their
[00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:40.350] own
[00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:40.890] in
[00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:41.030] their
[00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.270] home
[00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.350] or
[00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:41.470] their
[00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.650] home
[00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:41.930] office
[00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:42.170] with
[00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.350] another
[00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:42.630] team
[00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.190] that's
[00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.830] very
[00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:44.090] far

[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:05.820] other
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:05.960] thing
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.100] they
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:06.260] do
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:06.360] is
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:06.480] they
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.000] do
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.240] co
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:07.500]-located
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:07.840] work.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.400] They've
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:09.560] got
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:09.820] money
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.280] sometimes,
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:10.440] so
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:10.560] they're
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:10.760] flying
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.000] people
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.200] back
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:11.360] and
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:11.600] forth.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.340] But
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:12.520] again,
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:12.660] they're
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:12.820] also
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:13.340] doing
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:13.520] co
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:13.760]-located
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.000] work
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.160] by
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:14.360] doing
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:14.800] things
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.280] using
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:15.820] having
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:16.160] Skype
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:16.520] always
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:16.680] on
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:16.780] in
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:16.860] the
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.120] background
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:17.400] while
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:17.540] they're
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:17.740] working
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:17.980] together.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:18.820] But
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:18.920] they're
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.080] not
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:19.320] doing
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:19.500] it
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:19.740] the
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:19.960] entire
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.220] time.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:20.360] They
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:20.540] can't
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:20.760] afford
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.020] that.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:22.720] So
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:23.260] one
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:23.420] thing
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:23.520] you
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:23.620] can
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:23.820] do

[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:28.280] which
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:28.660] is
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.060] basically
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:29.260] what
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:29.420] we've
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:29.520] been

[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:31.360] few
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:31.620] weeks,
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.200] identifying
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:33.640] important
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.100] milestones
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:34.580] and
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:34.780] making
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.020] sure

[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:37.360] during
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:37.560] that
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:37.960] milestone
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.240] right
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:38.520] before
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:38.700] that
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:38.980] milestone
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:39.160] is
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:39.260] going
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:39.340] to
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:39.460] help
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:39.560] you
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:39.840] greatly,
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:40.840] doing
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.300] Instruct
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:41.640] Teams,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.020] and
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:42.160] doing
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:42.400] video
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:42.640] chat.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:45.960] And
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.120] here's
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:46.200] a
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.320] big
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:46.460] one
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:46.580] we
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:46.740] haven't
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:46.920] talked
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.100] about
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:47.200] in
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:47.400] class
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:47.600] so
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:47.880] much,
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:48.500] but
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:48.640] I
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.200] get
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:49.420] the
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:49.760] impression
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:49.980] that
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.180] some
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:50.280] of
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:50.380] you
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:50.900] might
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:51.540] be
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:51.900] interested
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:52.100] in
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:52.240] this
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:52.380] kind
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:52.460] of
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:52.700] thing.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:53.680] Having
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.060] coaches.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:54.900] So
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.040] we've
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.180] already
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.080] seen
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:56.280] some
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:56.360] of
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:56.460] the
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:56.760] teams
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.420] have
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:57.600] a
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:57.980] dedicated
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.340] Scrum
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:58.620] Master
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:58.940] or
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:37:59.140] a
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:37:59.300] producer.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.400] Think
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:00.600] about
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:00.960] having
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.140] a
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:01.460] dedicated
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:01.920] coach.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:02.720] So
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.060] someone
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:03.260] who's
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:03.480] on
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:03.660] your
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.040] team,
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:04.600] who
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:04.720] is
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:04.880] there
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.100] to
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:05.420] cultivate
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:05.780] team
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:06.160] spirit.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.240] They're
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:07.340] going
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:07.420] to
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:07.720] emphasize
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:07.960] the
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.240] importance
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.380] of
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:08.540] one
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:08.840] team.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:09.660] They
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.000] could
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.220] be
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:10.400] your
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:10.600] Scrum
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:10.880] Master
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.060] or
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:11.280] Producer,
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:11.540] but
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.360] they're
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.520] not
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:13.840] actually
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.040] the
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.320] same
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:14.640] role.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:15.320] The
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:15.580] Scrum
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:15.820] Master
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:15.960] or
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.000] the
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.280] Producer
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:16.700] is
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.900] measuring
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:18.580] productivity.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:19.280] They're
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:19.520] measuring
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.040] tasks,
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:20.620] how
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:20.840] well
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.020] things
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:21.160] get
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:21.380] done.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:22.300] The
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:22.540] coaches
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:22.840] are
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.020] very
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:23.380] different.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.000] They're
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.220] looking
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:24.460] at
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:24.640] how
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:24.860] people
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.340] interact
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:25.480] with
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:25.600] each
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:25.720] other,
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:25.900] how
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.080] people
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:26.340] talk
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:26.460] to
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:26.580] each
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:26.740] other,
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:27.220] how
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:27.380] people
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:27.600] work
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:27.740] with
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:27.860] each
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.080] other.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:28.900] Oftentimes,
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:29.660] people
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:29.840] who
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:29.940] are
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.240] naturally
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.540] inclined
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:30.660] to
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:30.780] do
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:31.060] one
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:31.800] can
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:31.940] be
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.200] inclined
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:32.360] to
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:32.460] do
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:32.620] the
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:32.800] other,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:33.100] but
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:33.240] that's
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:33.380] not
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:33.540] always
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:33.680] the
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:33.940] case.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:34.960] So
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.160] if
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:35.260] you
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:35.620] have
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:35.860] someone
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.000] on
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.120] your
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:36.440] team
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.080] who
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:37.560] is
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:37.760] one
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:37.860] of
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:38.260] those
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.520] extroverted,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.200] outgoing,
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:40.840] or
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.060] even
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:41.620] introverted,
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:41.980] but
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.440] really
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:42.800] interested
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:42.980] in
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:43.140] what
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:43.680] individuals
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.040] do
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:44.260] one
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:44.400]-on
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:44.580]-one
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.140] and
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:45.300] how
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:45.640] individuals
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.080] work,
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.020] see
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:47.140] if
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:47.220] you
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:47.520] can
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.740] incorporate
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:48.960] some
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.200] coaching
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:49.740] strategies
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:50.560] with
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:50.900] your
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.140] teammates.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:52.280] And
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:52.400] again,
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:52.500] you
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:52.580] can
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:52.680] do
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:52.820] one
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:52.900]-on
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.020]-one
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:53.300] meetings.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.320] And
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:54.400] we
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:54.500] can
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:54.660] talk
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:54.820] about
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.000] this
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.180] in
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:55.280] the
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:55.460] future.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:55.600] If
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:55.740] you're
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.060] interested
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:56.260] in
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:56.400] this
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:56.520] kind
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:56.580] of
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:56.740] stuff,
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.300] we
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:57.440] can
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:57.800] unpack
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.480] this
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:58.720] topic
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:58.880] and
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.040] talk
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:38:59.220] about
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:38:59.320] it
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:38:59.560] further.
[00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:01.970] But
[00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:02.050] I
[00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:02.190] highly
[00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.510] recommend
[00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.690] it.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:04.580] All
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:04.680] right,
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:04.920] so
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.560] I
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:05.680] did
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:05.900] mention
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.220] meetings.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:06.760] You
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:06.940] do
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.160] have
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:07.360] Agile
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:07.620] meetings.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.220] These
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:08.420] people
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:08.600] have
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:08.840] Agile
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.120] meetings.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:10.820] These
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:10.900] are
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:11.060] what
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:11.180] they
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:11.520] are.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.180] Hopefully,
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:12.380] you're
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:12.620] doing.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:13.340] So
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.380] who
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.120] has
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:16.380] a
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:16.940] formal
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.520] sprint
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.120] process
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:18.580] where
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:18.820] you
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.320] plan
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:19.500] your
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:19.800] sprint
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.140] before
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.360] you
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:20.640] start?
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.240] So
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:22.680] basically,
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:22.840] you
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:22.980] create
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.100] your
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.280] sprint
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:23.520] task
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:23.740] list
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:23.900] at
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.240] a
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:24.400] meeting.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.000] Is
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:25.220] everyone
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:25.500] there,
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:25.640] or
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:25.860] that's
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:25.960] when
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.080] you're
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:26.320] saying,
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:26.620] not
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.040] everyone's
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:27.220] there?
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:38.520] OK,
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.000] cool.
[00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:40.090] And
[00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:40.210] you
[00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:40.330] had
[00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:40.430] a
[00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.590] meeting
[00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:40.770] to
[00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:41.250] create
[00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:41.490] that.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:43.460] So
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:43.580] then
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:43.680] you
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:43.760] have
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:43.860] your
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.020] daily
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:44.280] stand
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:44.460]-ups.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:44.740] At
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:44.880] the
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.060] end
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:45.160] of
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:45.260] the
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:45.540] sprint,
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.040] you
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.160] want
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:47.220] to
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:47.320] have
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:47.420] a
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:47.580] sprint
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:47.840] review,
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:48.420] which
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:48.480] is
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:48.720] basically
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:48.940] the
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:49.260] inverse
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:49.400] of
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:49.500] the
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:49.660] sprint
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:49.900] planning
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.160] meeting.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:50.660] You
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:50.880] go
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.260] back
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:51.400] and
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:51.560] see
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:51.720] what
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:51.840] you
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.140] made.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:53.220] Hopefully,
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:53.380] you
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:53.480] have
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:53.620] a
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:53.800] build.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.180] And
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:54.240] you
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:54.380] just
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:54.620] basically
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:54.820] look
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:54.900] at
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:55.000] the
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.240] build,
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:55.820] compare
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:56.000] the
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.260] build
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:56.540] to
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:56.760] the
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.100] completed
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:57.920] tasks,
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:58.200] and
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:58.340] make
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:58.480] sure
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:58.640] it
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:58.880] matches.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:39:59.820] The
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.100] other
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:00.500] meeting
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.180] that
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.320] you
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:01.540] may
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:01.680] or
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:01.780] may
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:01.920] not
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.080] be
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:02.300] doing
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:02.480] is
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:02.660] the
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:02.980] Agile
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.660] retrospective.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:04.240] And
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:04.420] that's
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:04.560] how
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:04.700] did
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:04.800] you
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:04.980] work
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.180] this
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:05.420] week?
[00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:06.310] Is
[00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:06.510] anybody
[00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.730] doing
[00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:06.970] that?
[00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.070] Is
[00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:07.310] anybody,
[00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.950] at
[00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:08.150] the
[00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.410] end
[00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:08.550] of
[00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.710] their
[00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:09.130] sprint,
[00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:09.890] talking
[00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:10.310] about
[00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:11.890] the
[00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:12.310] processes
[00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:12.690] of
[00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:12.870] what
[00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:13.010] you
[00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.250] did
[00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.370] and
[00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.530] how
[00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:13.690] you
[00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:13.830] did
[00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:14.050] it?
[00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:18.290] Kind
[00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.350] of
[00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:18.450] what
[00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:18.530] I
[00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:18.810] expect.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:21.680] I
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:21.860] think
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:21.960] you're
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.120] doing
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:22.380] yourself
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:22.480] a
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:22.780] disservice
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:22.980] if
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:23.100] you're
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:23.220] not
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:23.420] doing
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:23.680] that.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.040] And
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.400] particularly,
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:24.660] if
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:24.800] you
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.020] are
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:25.240] doing
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:25.520] that,
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:25.640] and
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:25.780] you're
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:25.980] making
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.120] that
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:26.200] a
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:26.380] face
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:26.500]-to
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:26.660]-face
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:26.960] meeting,
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:27.960] that's
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.100] the
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:28.320] time
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:28.420] when
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:28.500] you
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:28.620] can
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:28.820] talk
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:28.980] about
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.140] some
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:29.220] of
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:29.320] these
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:29.660] interpersonal
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.080] issues.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:30.680] That's
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:30.800] the
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:30.920] time
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.020] when
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:31.080] you
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:31.180] can
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:31.360] talk
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:31.520] about
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:31.660] your
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:31.980] feelings.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.080] That's
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:33.180] the
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:33.340] time
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:33.460] when
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:33.560] you
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:33.740] can
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:34.380] open
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:34.620] up
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.000] and
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.340] try
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:35.480] to
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:35.640] figure
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:35.960] out
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.560] what
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:36.720] is
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.020] about,
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:37.580] why
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:37.760] are
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:37.920] some
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:37.980] of
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:38.120] these
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:38.540] tasks
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:38.980] not
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.220] getting
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:39.760] taken
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:40.060] on,
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.120] who's
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:41.300] not
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:41.520] doing
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:41.840] them,
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:42.440] and
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:42.780] what's
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:42.880] in
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.000] their
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.300] way
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:43.780] from
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.020] doing
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:44.180] them.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:44.300] But
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:44.560] really,
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:45.520] it's
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:45.640] not
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.660] really
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:47.840] about
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.160] what's
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:48.360] in
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:48.460] their
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:48.600] way.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:48.780] It's
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.140] difficult
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:49.300] to
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:49.400] talk
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:49.520] about.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:49.640] It's
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:49.720] not
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:49.880] about
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.100] what's
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:50.160] in
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:50.260] their
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:50.460] way,
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.000] but
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:51.100] it
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:51.220] might
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:51.360] be
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:51.680] about
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.140] what
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:52.540] outside
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:52.720] of
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:52.820] the
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.140] project
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:53.340] and
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:53.540] outside
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:53.660] of
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:53.780] the
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:54.020] team
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:54.260] could
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:54.380] be
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:54.480] in
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:54.600] their
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:54.780] way.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.280] And
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:55.380] you
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:55.500] can
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.080] work
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:56.240] through
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:56.420] some
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:56.500] of
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:56.640] those
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:56.780] kind
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:56.840] of
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.080] issues.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:01.780] So
[00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:02.530] I'm
[00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:02.790] done.
[00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.110] What
[00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:03.230] I'd
[00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.310] like
[00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:03.390] you
[00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.510] to
[00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.690] do
[00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:04.090] before
[00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:04.290] you
[00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:04.450] go
[00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:04.530] and
[00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:04.710] work
[00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.770] on
[00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:04.870] your
[00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:05.170] teams
[00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:05.730] is
[00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:06.670] schedule
[00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.930] a
[00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:07.190] sprint
[00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.970] retrospective.
[00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:08.430] So
[00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:09.150] take
[00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.250] a
[00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:09.350] look
[00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:09.450] at
[00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:10.130] your
[00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.370] sprint
[00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.730] process.
[00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:11.450] How
[00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.670] long
[00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.770] is
[00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:11.870] your
[00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:12.070] sprint?
[00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:12.210] Is
[00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:12.310] it
[00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:12.510] one
[00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.710] week
[00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.790] or
[00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.990] two
[00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.250] weeks?
[00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:14.170] We've
[00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:14.250] been
[00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:14.510] assuming
[00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.710] it's
[00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.750] a
[00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.890] one
[00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:15.070]-week
[00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:16.490] sprint.
[00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:19.250] Schedule
[00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:19.430] a
[00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.750] time
[00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:20.050] period
[00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:20.270] that
[00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.510] everyone
[00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.730] can
[00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:21.170] attend
[00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:21.770] and
[00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.070] an
[00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:23.230] amount
[00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.350] of
[00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:23.490] time
[00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:23.610] that
[00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:23.690] they
[00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:23.810] can
[00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:24.170] attend,
[00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:25.090] that
[00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:25.210] they
[00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:25.330] can
[00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:25.610] see
[00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:25.830] each
[00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:25.970] other
[00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:26.210] face
[00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:26.330]-to
[00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:26.530]-face,
[00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:26.710] but
[00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.910] not
[00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:27.370] necessarily
[00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:27.670] are
[00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.770] in
[00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.910] the
[00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:28.130] same
[00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.710] room.
[00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:29.050] If
[00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:29.130] they

[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.260] about

[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.320] you
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:58.460] are

[00:41:59.160 --> 00:41:59.320] other.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:01.740] And
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:01.940] yeah,
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:02.240] I'm
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:02.320] going
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:02.400] to

[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:02.840] to
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:02.940] you
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:03.140] about
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:03.360] this
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:03.700] again
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:03.840] in
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:03.920] a
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.040] couple
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:04.420] weeks.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:05.280] And
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:05.720] in
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:05.800] a
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:05.920] couple
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.100] weeks,
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:06.200] I'm
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:06.260] going
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:06.260] to
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:06.400] give
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:06.480] you
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:06.680] some
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.220] more.
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:08.740] Once
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:08.920] you're
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.240] actually
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:09.620] in
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.260] the
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:10.620] process
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:11.020] of,
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:11.100] I
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:11.240] think
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:11.680] most
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:11.780] of
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:11.840] you
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:11.980] right
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.080] now
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.180] are
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:12.420] probably
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:12.660] in
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:12.860] the
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.440] concepting
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:13.820] phase,
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.080] pre
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.300]-production
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:14.640] phase
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:14.800] right
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.040] now.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:15.520] You're
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:15.700] still
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:15.860] kind
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:15.940] of
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.120] figuring
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:16.300] out
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:16.420] your
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:16.660] game.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:17.540] I
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:17.940] guess
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:18.340] you
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:18.600] guys
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:18.740] are
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:18.920] actually
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.120] working
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.200] on
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:19.280] your
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:19.480] back
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:19.660] end
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.200] because
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:20.440] someone
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:20.620] did
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:20.980] the
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:21.200] initial
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:21.500] design
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:21.760] for
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:21.900] you.
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.020] The
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:23.180] rest
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:23.260] are
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:23.460] probably
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:23.700] still
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.040] working
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:24.160] at
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:24.260] the
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:24.560] design
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:24.860] phase.
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:25.600] When
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:25.740] I
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:25.900] talk
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.040] about
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:26.200] this
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:26.640] again,
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:27.420] you'll
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:27.700] likely
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.040] be
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:28.400] in
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:28.680] full
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.100]-on
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.260] production
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:30.620] mode.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.040] And
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:31.140] so
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:31.320] some
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:31.420] of
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:31.840] the
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.180] activities
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:32.660] I'm
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:32.740] going
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:32.740] to
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:32.920] show
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.140] you
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.180] might
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:34.460] hopefully
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:34.740] help
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:35.780] when
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:35.880] you're
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.000] doing
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:36.160] these
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:36.360] meetings.
[00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:38.730] Any
[00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:39.130] questions?
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:42.300] OK,
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:42.600] so
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:42.740] it's
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:42.880] 1
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.120].50.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:43.680] Go
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:43.800] ahead
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:43.880] and
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.020] take
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:44.100] a
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:44.220] few
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:44.440] minutes
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:44.560] to
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.160] break.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:45.740] And
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:45.840] then
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:45.980] the
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:46.160] rest
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:46.300] of
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:46.400] the
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:46.660] class
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:46.820] is
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.000] yours
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.180] to
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:47.440] work
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:47.620] in
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:47.760] your
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.160] teams.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:49.260] But
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:49.500] still,
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:49.720] do
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:50.000] this.
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:51.460] You
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:51.580] can
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:51.720] leave.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:52.820] You
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.140] can
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:53.320] leave.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:53.780] All
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:53.820] right,
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:53.940] go
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.180] ahead.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.000] And
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.240] I
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:42:59.400] think
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:42:59.520] we
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:42:59.620] can
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:42:59.780] all
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.000] turn
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.160] around
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:00.320] and
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:00.440] work.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:00.880] Yeah,
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:01.040] we
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.040] can
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.260] do
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:01.320] that.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:01.640] That's
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:01.840] great.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:02.540] Yeah,
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:02.680] I
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:02.700] don't
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:02.800] know.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.100] Yeah,
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:03.220] I
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:03.260] think
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:03.760] dialogue
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.040] would
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:04.120] be
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:04.280] kind
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:04.420] of
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:04.580] cool.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:04.820] I
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:04.920] have
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.060] two
[00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:05.260] questions.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:07.200] What?
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:08.620] The
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:08.940] timer?
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:09.280] I'm
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:09.360] not
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:09.460] sure
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:09.640] what
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:09.740] the
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:09.860] timer
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:09.980] is.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:10.360] Yeah,
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:10.480] it
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:10.540] could
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:10.540] be.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:11.820] So
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.140] how
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:12.280] about
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:12.440] we
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:12.620] say
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:12.900] something
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:13.460] like,
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:14.340] what's
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:14.400] the
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:14.560] next
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:14.560] half
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:14.560] minute?
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:14.940] We'll
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:15.100] just
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:15.260] do
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:15.420] that.
