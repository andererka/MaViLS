[00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.310] And
[00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.450] I
[00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.670] think
[00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.930] we're

[00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.490] lecture
[00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.670] number

[00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.290] focused
[00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.630] on
[00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.770] the

[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.620] What
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.680] I
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.800] wanted
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.940] to
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.040] do
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.120] to
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.240] get
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.540] everybody
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.660] in

[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.020] of

[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.220] balls.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.720] So
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.080] this
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.220] is
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.480] really,

[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.520] up.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.720] But
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.940] B,
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.900] there
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.500] we
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.660] go.
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.820] All
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.960] right,
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.420] don't
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.980] let
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.180] it
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.900] fall.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.240] There
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.340] you
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.440] go.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.760] I
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.900] know
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.220] Ashley's
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.380] got
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.660] solid
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.940] hands.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.580] All
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.680] right,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.900] here's
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.080] one.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.040] Pass
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.180] that
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.400] around
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.560] as
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.760] well.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.420] We've
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.480] got
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.580] a
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.700] few
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.940] more.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.160] There,
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.000] there,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.600] and
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.260] lastly,
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.160] right
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.260] up
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.340] the
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.460] middle.
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.140] There
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.240] you
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.380] go.
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.020] OK,
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.760] so
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.660] today's
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.880] lecture
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.020] is
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.200] really
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.420] about
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.580] the
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.760] solar
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.180] resource.
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.640] And
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.980] as
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.120] we
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.280] go
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.620] through,
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.320] it
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.480] kind
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.580] of
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.780] helps
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.900] to
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.020] have
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.160] a
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.340] sphere
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.440] in
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.520] your
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.740] hand,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.100] since
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.060] oftentimes
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.540] we
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.500] perceive
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.660] the
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.820] world
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.940] as
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.120] being
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.460] flat,
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.240] no
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.460] fault
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.580] of
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.700] our
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.860] own.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.120] Locally,
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.520] one
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.660] can
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.040] approximate
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.300] it
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.440] as
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.700] a
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.980] flat
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.300] body.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.040] That's
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.560] certainly
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.560] a
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.720] good
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.160] possibility.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.560] Wouldn't
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.700] mind
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.980] passing
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.180] these
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.300] out
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.380] to
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.500] your
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.700] friends
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.880] as
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.060] well.
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.540] But
[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.940] in
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.240] reality,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.460] if
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.580] we
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.940] really
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.100] want
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.200] to
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.460] understand
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.580] the
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.740] solar
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.120] resource,
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.780] we
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.000] really
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.200] have
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.300] to
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.480] begin
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.020] understanding
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.320] or
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.620] thinking
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.760] in
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.980] terms
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.140] of
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.440] spheres
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.640] and
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.760] in
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.980] terms
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.260] of
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.100] circles,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.340] or
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.360] in
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.840] most
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.140] cases,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.620] ellipses.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.440] And
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.600] so
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.000] we're
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.100] going
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.160] to
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.320] dive
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.500] into
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.640] the
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.800] solar
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.180] resource.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.200] Before
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.460] we
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.740] really
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.000] dive
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.100] in
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.380] detail
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.580] into
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.700] the
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.840] solar
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.080] resource,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.240] I
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.360] wanted
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.520] to
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.640] give
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.780] you
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.300] feedback
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.720] to
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.980] your
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.460] surveys.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.820] So
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.900] you
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.000] did
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.100] a
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.320] background
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.720] assessment
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.120] survey,
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.660] a
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.900] census,
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.120] if
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.220] you
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.440] will,
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.320] and
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.520] filled
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.640] out
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.720] a
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.840] number
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.000] of
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.320] questions
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.600] last
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.860] class
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.100] about
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.280] your
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.660] backgrounds.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.160] And
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.220] I
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.340] wanted
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.480] to
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.740] provide
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.840] you
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.980] the
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.320] feedback,
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.020] the
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.440] consolidated
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.100] information,
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.740] because
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.980] it's
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.200] really
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.500] telling
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.720] about
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.900] who
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.100] your
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.360] colleagues
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.660] are.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.780] This
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.060] right
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.380] here
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.980] is
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.120] a
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.240] little
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.440] bit
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.540] of
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.680] a
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.080] snapshot
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.680] of
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.440] expertise
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.040] and
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.520] current
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.280] career
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.760] trajectory.
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.640] So
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.940] the
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.140] self
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.420]-defined
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.780] expertise
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.940] in
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.020] the
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.140] bottom
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.340] left
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.500] is
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.840] really,
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.420] I
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.560] think,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.680] the
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.840] most
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.080] telling
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.460] parameter.
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.280] For
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.420] the
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.780] undergrads
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.980] here,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.460] you
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.580] may
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.880] define
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.140] yourself
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.320] by
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.440] your
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.660] major
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.000] today.
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.320] But
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.440] when
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.540] you
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.840] graduate
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.060] and
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.160] go
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.260] on
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.340] to
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.540] grad
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.820] school,
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.360] you
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.600] might,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.860] say,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.960] for
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.180] example,
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.320] do
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.440] your
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.720] undergrad
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.880] in
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.180] physics
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.460] and
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.580] then
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.640] do
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.760] your
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.000] graduate
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.280] school
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.420] in
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.740] mechanical
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.100] engineering,
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.280] but
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.480] still
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.820] consider
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.140] yourself
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.300] a
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.580] physicist
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.860] at
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.100] heart.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.800] And
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.920] so
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.020] that's
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.160] why
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.300] I
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.560] ask
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.720] this
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.000] question
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.340] here.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.800] What
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.900] is
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.000] your
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.220] self
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.460]-defined
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.900] expertise?
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.300] Because
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.460] there
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.580] are
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.800] several
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.100] graduate
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.440] students
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.540] who
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.640] have
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.980] changed
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.780] fields,
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.980] if
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.080] you
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.220] will,
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.380] from
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.640] undergrad
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.820] to
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.060] graduate
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.320] school.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.300] Most
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.640] people
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.900] in
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.040] the
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.340] audience,
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.880] by
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.040] and
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.300] large,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.780] consider
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.240] themselves
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.660] engineers,
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.440] either
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.760] material
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.240] science
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.680] engineers
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.020] or
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.740] mechanical
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.200] engineers.
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.160] Chemistry
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.820] is
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.520] strong
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.720] as
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.960] well.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.600] And
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.720] then
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.820] we
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.220] have
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.860] about
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.160] 10
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.660] different

[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.700] represented.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.220] And
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.720] that's
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.140] really
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.440] cool.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.940] It's
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.060] going
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.320] to
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.960] manifest
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.300] itself
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.420] in

[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.580] And
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.700] you'll
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.880] see
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.060] the

[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.580] of

[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.100] The

[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.060] who
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.100] are
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.300] actually

[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.100] class
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.560] are
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.860] folks
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.080] who
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.340] are
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.460] in
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.760] industry
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.260] and
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.560] perhaps
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.820] have
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.480] real
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.800] world

[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.840] the
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.080] people

[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.500] the
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.760] class,
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.940] as
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.140] well,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.620] either
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.700] have
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.000] gained
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.120] expertise
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.500] in
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.720] solar

[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.800] with
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.940] their
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.180] work.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.780] Some
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.900] have
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.260] installed
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.580] solar
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.900] panels.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.240] Other
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.400] ones
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.500] have
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.640] done
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.980] research
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.160] or
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.320] are
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.460] doing
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.800] research
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.000] in
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.180] solar.
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.720] So
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.820] it's
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.920] a
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.080] pretty
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.380] diverse
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.700] group.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.080] And
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.280] some
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.420] are,
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.560] as

[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.560] car
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.820] team,
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.100] which
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.280] is
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.560] rolling
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.760] out
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.900] its
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.040] new
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.260] model
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.820] in
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.840] a
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.920] few
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.100] days'
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.320] time.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.340] In
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.520] terms
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.660] of
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.860] learning
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.220] methods,
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.740] it
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.860] was
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.080] pretty
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.440] well
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.880] split
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.680] between
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.000] hands
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.120]-on
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.420] labs,

[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.280] guest
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.720] lectures.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.680] And
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.920] I'll
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.300] get
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.520] back
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.620] to
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.760] that
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.840] in
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.920] a
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.040] few
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.400] slides.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.680] In
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.860] terms
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.980] of
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.180] class
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.520] project
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.920] interest,
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.200] there
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.380] was
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.620] a
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.000] strong
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.600] interest
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.880] in
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.140] working
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.400] with
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.580] pre
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.960]-established
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.420] projects.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.740] So
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.940] we've
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.160] listened
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.420] to
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.660] that.
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.460] This
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.580] is
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.740] pretty
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.120] consistent
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.320] with
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.600] previous
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.920] years.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.420] And
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.580] so
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.720] we
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.880] have
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.140] several

[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.740] ready
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.000] for
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.180] you.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.160] And

[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.140] had
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.280] an

[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.700] project.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.020] I'd
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.180] like

[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.740] These
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.860] are
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.160] your

[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.080] spectrum
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.320] from
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.620] natural
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.080] sciences
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.280] to
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.560] social
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.980] sciences
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.240] and
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.620] engineering
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.800] in
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.880] the
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.020] middle.
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.160] And
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.680] obviously,
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.880] this
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.020] is
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.200] more
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.320] of
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.980] a
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.300] loop
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.660] than
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.240] a
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.560] linear
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.540] line.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.820] But
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.900] bear
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.060] with
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.220] me.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.880] There
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.980] was
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.100] a
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.300] strong
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.560] interest
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.720] in
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.100] fundamentals.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.640] And
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.920] that's
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.200] certainly,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.680] I
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.880] think,
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.080] what
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.300] the
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.440] core
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.540] of
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.640] the
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.880] class
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.000] is
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.220] about,
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.360] at
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.480] least
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.760] the
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.040] first
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.200] third
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.300] of
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.400] the
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.720] class.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.720] Going
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.940] in
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.140] terms
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.320] of

[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.560] these
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.660] are
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.760] the

[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.100] of
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.300] people
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.500] who
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.900] listed
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.220] a

[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.980] topic
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.160] as
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.260] of
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.440] great
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.700] interest
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.840] to

[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.260] And

[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.140] here.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.760] We
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.960] have
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.240] already
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.520] lined

[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.740] modules
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.660] like
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.840] this
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.960] one
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.120] right
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.340] here,
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.660] only
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.940] much,
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.100] much
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.360] bigger,
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.240] and
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.640] has
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.980] strong

[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.940] with
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.280] existing

[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.300] companies
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.440] in
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.540] the
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.760] area,
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.220] as
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.340] well
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.460] as
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.600] more

[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.320] companies.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.080] So
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.280] that'll
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.360] be
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.460] a
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.540] lot
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.640] of
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.780] fun.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.320] And
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.600] we're

[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.800] and
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.960] guest
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.280] lectures
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.440] to
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.760] match
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.580] this
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.320] feedback
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.580] right
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.720] here.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.860] So
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.060] thank
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.420] you.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.680] We'll
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.960] mold
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.820] the
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.040] course,
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.400] shape
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.560] it,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.820] craft
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.040] it
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.580] to
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.800] fit
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.180] your
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.620] interests.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.000] So
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.480] to
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.680] hop
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.860] into
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.020] the
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.180] solar
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.540] resource.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.180] And
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.580] without
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.880] further
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.160] ado,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.900] the
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.180] subject
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.340] of
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.560] today
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.000] and
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.120] the
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.400] motivation
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.620] for
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.760] wearing
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.940] this
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.180] tie
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.560] is
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.900] really
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.480] the
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.760] solar
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.180] resource,
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.440] the
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.660] sun.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.340] This
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.460] is
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.580] where
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.680] it
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.820] all
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.160] starts.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.340] If
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.440] we're
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.540] to
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.040] understand
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.360] PV,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.200] photovoltaics,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.360] the
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.660] conversion
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.840] of
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.060] sunlight
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.260] into
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.700] electricity,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.240] it
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.500] starts
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.720] from
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.900] the
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.080] sun.
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.380] And
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.520] so
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.800] spending
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.000] some
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.140] good
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.380] time
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.680] thinking
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.920] about
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.120] the
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.320] sun
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.900] is
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.340] really,
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.860] really
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.280] important.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.560] And
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.360] it
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.480] will
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.780] avoid
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.940] the
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.360] embarrassing
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.960] situation.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.140] How
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.300] many
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.400] of
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.500] you
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.660] have
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.920] been
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.100] at
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.220] a

[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.800] center
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.340] walking
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.720] along,
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.140] and
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.240] a
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.400] little
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.740] child
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.920] is
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.280] asking
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.460] his
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.780] parent,
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.720] dad,
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.060] why
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.580] is
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.780] the
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.020] sky
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.380] blue?
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.580] Or
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.880] why
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.160] is
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.320] this
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.480] such
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.580] and
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.800] such?
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.920] And
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.080] the
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.440] answers
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.720] you'll
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.040] hear
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.320] just
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.560] make
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.700] you
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.820] want
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.960] to
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.080] tear
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.280] your
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.520] ears
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.800] out.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.360] Say,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.540] my
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.780] goodness.
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.100] So
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.540] part
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.620] of
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.780] this
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.060] is
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.280] just
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.600] general
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.940] knowledge.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.120] It's
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.320] getting
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.480] a
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.620] feel
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.880] for
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.340] the
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.520] world
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.640] and
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.760] the
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.940] universe
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:07.140] and
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.420] asking
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.620] those
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.980] questions
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.240] again
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.420] that
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.580] the
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.880] little
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.160] children
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.300] will
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.600] ask,
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.820] but
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.220] that
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.320] we
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.580] forget
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.740] to
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.980] ask
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.100] as
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.220] we
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.380] move
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.540] on
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.660] with
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.800] our
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.060] lives.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.220] OK,
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.820] so
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.380] moving
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.120] forward.
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.860] The

[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.800] these
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.000] right
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.260] here.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.720] By

[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.680] and
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.960] hopefully
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.380] you
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.580] already
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.780] have
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.880] a

[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.040] I'll
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.240] quiz

[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.980] We

[00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.450] are
[00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.530] the
[00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.670] big
[00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.930] effects
[00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:04.070] and
[00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.190] what
[00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.270] are
[00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.350] the
[00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.490] ones
[00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.690] that
[00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.950] don't
[00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.150] really
[00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.350] matter.
[00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.490] We

[00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.570] a
[00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.890] project,
[00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.130] whether
[00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.290] it's

[00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.690] country,
[00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.830] world.
[00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.230] And
[00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.590] a
[00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:14.710] lot
[00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.790] of

[00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.850] assignment.
[00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.210] So
[00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.370] we'll

[00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.910] but
[00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.050] then
[00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.430] ask
[00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.610] you
[00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:18.910] to

[00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.770] those
[00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.070] questions.
[00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:20.310] And
[00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:20.590] for
[00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.750] those

[00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:21.030] have
[00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.170] already
[00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.370] picked
[00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:21.570] up
[00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.890] your
[00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.090] piece

[00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.310] number
[00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.490] one,
[00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:22.790] you'll
[00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.030] see
[00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.470] relevant
[00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.870] questions.
[00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.910] Where's
[00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.070] this?
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.440] Does
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:29.620] anybody
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.260] recognize
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.700] this
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.760] right
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.000] here?
[00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.290] If
[00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.350] I
[00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.650] start
[00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.350] rambling
[00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.630] off
[00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.930] names.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.460] What
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.740] city
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.220] has
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.780] Pennsylvania
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.220] Avenue,
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.060] Independence
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.420] Ave,
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.580] Washington
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:41.820] DC?
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.080] This
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.180] is
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.320] right
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.620] outside
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.780] of
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:42.880] the
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.180] National
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.500] Air
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.940] and
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.200] Space
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.540] Museum.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.240] What
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.440] this
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:45.740] little
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.760] girl
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.020] here
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.320] is
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:47.620] pointing
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:47.820] to
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:47.940] is
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.100] the
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.340] sun.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.260] And
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.360] then
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.480] we
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.720] have
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.240] Mercury,
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.300] Venus,
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.000] Earth,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.420] Mars,
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.620] and
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:52.760] so
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:52.920] forth.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.060] So
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.220] it's
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:53.620] essentially
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:53.760] a
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:53.920] solar
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.200] system
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.400] to
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.660] scale.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.240] As
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.360] you
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:55.620] walk
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:55.940] out
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.820] of
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.980] the
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.320] Air
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.400] and
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.640] Space
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.000] Museum
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.720] and
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:07:59.900] walk
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.040] down
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.200] the
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.400] street,
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:00.600] you'll
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:00.720] be
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.060] passing
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.440] the
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:01.700] different
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.060] bodies
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.220] in
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.340] our
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:02.520] solar
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:02.880] system.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:03.620] And
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:03.920] so
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.460] just
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:04.600] as
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:04.740] a
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:04.880] quick
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.060] little
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.440] review
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:05.920] to
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.160] kind
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.240] of
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:06.420] get
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:06.560] us
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:06.940] situated
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.220] and
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.360] to
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:07.580] ask
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:07.760] the
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.120] questions
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.380] that
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:08.780] little
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.060] kiddies
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:09.240] might
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.540] ask
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:09.740] us,
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.400] how
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:10.680] far
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:10.860] is
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.000] it
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.260] from
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:11.560] the
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:11.780] Earth
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.080] to
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.260] the
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.400] sun?
[00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:15.890] About
[00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.230] 100
[00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.490] million
[00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.750] miles.
[00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.910] Yeah,
[00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:17.190] 93
[00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:17.490] million
[00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:17.830] miles.
[00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:19.650] Less
[00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:19.790] or
[00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:20.050] minus
[00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.430] somewhere
[00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.550] in
[00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.650] the
[00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:20.950] range
[00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.170] of
[00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.530] maybe
[00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:22.250] a
[00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:22.510] percent
[00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.670] or
[00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.850] so,
[00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:22.970] a
[00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:23.090] few
[00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:23.490] percent,
[00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.890] depending
[00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.130] on
[00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:25.370] what
[00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.210] time
[00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.350] of
[00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.490] year
[00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:26.650] we
[00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:26.790] are,
[00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.950] since
[00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:27.110] we're
[00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.190] in
[00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:27.290] a
[00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.370] little
[00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:27.490] bit
[00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:27.570] of
[00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:27.630] an
[00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:27.930] elliptical
[00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:28.090] orbit.
[00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:28.810] Good,
[00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.210] so
[00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.290] that's
[00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.050] the
[00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:31.350] distance
[00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.470] to
[00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:31.590] the
[00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:31.750] sun.
[00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.230] It
[00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.270] would
[00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:32.330] be
[00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:32.490] about
[00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:32.990] 150
[00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.950] million
[00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:34.430] kilometers.
[00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:35.090] How
[00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.270] long
[00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:35.370] does
[00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:35.490] it
[00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:35.650] take
[00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:35.870] light
[00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:36.030] to
[00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.270] travel
[00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:36.490] that
[00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:36.830] distance?
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.000] About
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.220] eight
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:39.540] minutes,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.360] eight
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.440] and
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:40.520] a
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:40.600] third
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:40.900] minutes,
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.080] right?
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:41.360] So
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.240] it
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.440] takes
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:42.560] a
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:42.640] little
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:42.800] bit
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:42.940] for
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.040] the
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.140] light
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.280] to
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:43.440] reach
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:43.660] us.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.640] Good,
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.040] some
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.180] more
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.460] questions.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:46.680] How
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.020] far
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.480] are
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:47.660] the
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.080] other
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.520] planets
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.020] in
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.280] our
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:49.460] solar
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:49.880] system
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.340] to
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:50.520] the
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:50.720] sun?
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:51.860] Going
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.040] in
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.220] order
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:52.460] from
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:52.760] Mercury
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.240] out,
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:54.500] just
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:54.600] to
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:54.700] get
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:54.900] us
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.580] situated
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:55.920] here.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.340] If
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:56.680] we
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:56.940] are,
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:57.420] at
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:57.580] any
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:57.760] point,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.040] planning
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.180] and
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:58.340] throwing
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:58.520] up
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:58.840] satellites
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.160] and
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.520] sending
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:08:59.620] them
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:08:59.680] to
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:08:59.860] other
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.160] planets,
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.360] this
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:00.460] is
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:00.560] a
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:00.660] good
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:00.840] thing
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.000] to
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.220] kind
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:01.280] of
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.420] keep
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:01.500] in
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:01.580] the
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:01.720] back
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:01.820] of
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:01.920] our
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.160] minds.
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:03.660] So
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:03.780] if
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:03.880] we
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.260] define
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:04.440] an
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.800] astronomical
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.360] unit,
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.220] not
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:06.360] in
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:06.560] terms
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:06.740] of
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:06.880] our
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.280] national
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.500] debt,
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:07.660] but
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:07.800] in
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:07.960] terms
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.060] of
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:08.160] the
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.460] distance
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:08.720] from
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:08.920] the
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.100] Earth
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.240] to
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:09.400] the
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:09.620] sun,
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:10.660] that's
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:10.780] an
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.060] astronomical
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.560] unit.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.160] Mercury
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.520] would
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:13.680] be
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:13.900] somewhere
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.220] around
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.460] 0
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:14.840].4.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:15.760] Venus,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:16.000] 0
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.460].7.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:16.980] Mars,
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.300] 1
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:17.900].5.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.180] So
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:18.360] that's
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:18.500] all
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:18.660] kind
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:18.740] of
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:18.840] in
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:18.960] our
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.240] neighborhood,
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.480] right?
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.260] And
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:20.360] then
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:20.480] from
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:20.680] Mars
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:20.860] to
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:21.060] Jupiter
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:21.220] is
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.300] a
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.360] bit
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.440] of
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:21.520] a
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:21.740] jump.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.000] It
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.080] goes
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.200] from
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.320] 1
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.680].5
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:22.800] to
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.200] 5.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:23.860] Then
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.020] from
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.240] Jupiter
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.420] to
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:24.620] Saturn
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:24.800] is
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.140] 10.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:25.720] Well,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:25.940] sorry,
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:26.720] 10
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:26.860] is
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:26.960] the
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.180] distance
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:27.340] from
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:27.520] Saturn
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:27.680] to
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:27.820] the
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:27.960] sun.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:28.740] And
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:28.960] then
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.520] 30
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.080] and
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.380] 40.
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:31.720] Sorry,
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.020] 10,
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.320] 20,
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:32.540] 30,
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:32.760] 40.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.200] So
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.280] it
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:33.560] goes,
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.240] Jupiter
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:34.400] is
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.720] 5,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.180] Saturn
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:35.500] 10,
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.000] Uranus
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.120] would
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:37.260] be
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:37.680] 20,
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.260] Neptune
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:38.740] 30,
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.080] Pluto
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.440] 40.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.500] Pluto,
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.020] planet,
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.380] sort
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:41.480] of.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.100] So
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.600] it's
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:42.760] easy
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:42.920] to
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.140] remember
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:43.380] those
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:43.620] numbers,
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:43.940] because
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.080] it
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.220] goes
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:44.520] 5,
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:44.720] 10,
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.020] 20.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.380] That's
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:45.580] just
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:45.860] essentially
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.000] a
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.180] sequence
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:46.340] of
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:46.580] doubling,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.020] and
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.160] then
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.400] 10,
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:47.700] 20,
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:47.980] 30,
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.320] 40.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.480] I'm
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:49.620] giving
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:49.740] you
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.040] approximate
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.380] numbers
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:50.520] here,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:50.640] but
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.080] that's
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.800] something
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:51.980] just
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.080] to
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.200] keep
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:52.340] in
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:52.520] mind,
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.000] all
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.240] in
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:53.480] terms
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:53.620] of
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:53.920] astronomical
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.360] units.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:54.660] So
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:54.760] in
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:54.880] case
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:54.980] a
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.100] little
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.260] kid
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:55.460] comes
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:55.600] up
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:55.700] and
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:55.880] asks
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.020] you,
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.120] you
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.280] can
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.280] spread
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:57.380] out
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:57.480] the
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:57.640] answer.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.220] Let's
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.580] talk
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:00.820] about
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.640] the
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.120] sun.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.240] This
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.340] is
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:02.480] just
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:02.620] a
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:02.820] review
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.000] of
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.140] our
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:03.420] readings
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:03.660] right
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:03.860] here.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.120] This
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.380] was
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:05.860] a
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.220] representation
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:06.520] of
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:06.640] the
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:06.840] sun
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.080] and
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.220] the
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:07.480] Earth
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:07.820] moving
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.060] around.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:09.800] And
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.220] what
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:10.460] is
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.120] solstice
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.260] and
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.660] equinox?
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:11.780] What
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:11.860] do
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.020] those
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:12.260] refer
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:12.460] to?
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.260] What
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:18.680] is
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:18.860] the
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.500] equinox?
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.020] Yeah,
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.300] equal
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:23.480] amount
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:23.620] of
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:23.760] light
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:23.860] and
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.020] dark
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.340] throughout
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.620] pretty
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:25.780] much
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:25.880] all
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.000] the
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.220] world,
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:26.800] except
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:26.960] if
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.120] you're
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.440] really
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:27.720] standing
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:27.880] on
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.080] the
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.100] tippy
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.340] top
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.740] in
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:29.820] the
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:29.960] bottom.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.060] So
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:31.280] equal
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:31.480] amount
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:31.640] of
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:31.800] light
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:31.900] and
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.120] dark
[00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.800] throughout
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.020] the
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.280] world
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:33.580] on
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:33.720] that
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.040] particular
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.360] day.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:34.620] So
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.060] the
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.660] day
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:36.780] and
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:36.860] the
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.080] night
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.560] have
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:38.740] the
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:38.900] same
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.080] amount
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.180] of
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.340] length.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:39.500] If
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:39.620] you
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:39.840] move
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.060] over
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.220] into
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:40.440] this
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:40.700] region
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:40.880] right
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.120] here,
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.700] this
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:41.860] would
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.200] be
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.600] a
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:42.760] region
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:42.900] of
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.000] our
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.200] northern
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.580] hemisphere
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:43.960] summer,
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:44.600] southern
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:44.940] hemisphere
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.300] winter.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:45.900] Over
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.200] here,
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:46.440] vice
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:46.760] versa.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:47.580] And
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:47.740] the
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.060] solstice
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.240] would
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.780] be?
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.320] Yeah,
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:52.600] so
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.020] the
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.560] shortest
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.320] or
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.480] the
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:54.760] longest
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.160] day
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:55.280] of
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.360] the
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.480] year,
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:55.760] depending
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.320] on
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.580] what
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.240] side
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.400] you're
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:57.540] on.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:57.940] So
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.020] in
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:58.120] the
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.260] northern
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:58.680] hemisphere,
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.000] the
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.480] June
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:00.840] solstice
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.100] would
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:01.340] be
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.660] the
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.360] summer
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:02.740] solstice
[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:02.960] for
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.120] us.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.240] It
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.340] would
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:03.460] be
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:03.700] the
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.000] longest
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.280] day.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.020] And
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:05.320] if
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:05.460] you're
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:05.560] in
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:05.680] the
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:05.840] southern
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.200] hemisphere,
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:06.360] it
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.420] would
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:06.520] be
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:06.640] the
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:06.860] shortest
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.100] day.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:07.680] Depending
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:07.780] on
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:07.880] what
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.060] time
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:08.220] zone
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:08.400] you're
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:08.520] in,
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:08.640] there
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:08.780] might
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:08.940] be
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:09.060] a
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:09.360] variation
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:09.620] of
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.020] one
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:10.300] day,
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.180] hitherto.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:11.520] Good.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.260] And
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:15.740] what
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.020] are
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.420] the
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:17.680] seasons
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.060] caused
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:18.280] by?
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:18.460] What
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:18.600] is
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:18.760] this
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:18.920] kind
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.040] of
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.420] tilt
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:19.720] right
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.020] here?
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.640] What
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:20.740] is
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:20.880] that
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.120] called?
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.440] Declination
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:23.840] angle.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.260] And
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:24.700] approximately
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:24.900] how
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.080] much
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.200] is
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:25.380] that?
[00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.170] 23
[00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.370] and
[00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:27.570] 1?
[00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.010] 23
[00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:28.610].45.
[00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.830] Yeah,
[00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.950] so
[00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:29.230] 23
[00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.330] and
[00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:29.410] 1
[00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:29.590] degrees.
[00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.110] Good.
[00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:31.290] And
[00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:31.590] we
[00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.750] can
[00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.010] visualize
[00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:32.370] all
[00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:32.490] of
[00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:32.810] this
[00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:33.490] on
[00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:33.730] the
[00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:34.130] PPCD
[00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.310] ROM
[00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.110] on
[00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.170] the
[00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:35.390] website.
[00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:36.090] So
[00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.270] this
[00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:36.390] was
[00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:36.550] part
[00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.630] of
[00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.730] your
[00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:36.950] signed
[00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:37.190] reading.
[00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.570] And
[00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.050] here's
[00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.170] the
[00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.330] Earth
[00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:39.630] going
[00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:39.950] around
[00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:40.670] the
[00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.870] sun
[00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.150] in
[00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.290] this
[00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:41.850] representation.
[00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.030] Likewise,
[00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.290] if
[00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:43.450] you
[00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:43.770] want
[00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:43.850] to
[00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.990] take
[00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.090] one
[00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.170] of
[00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:44.270] your
[00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:44.470] balls
[00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.610] and
[00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:44.770] just
[00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:44.910] kind
[00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.050] of
[00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.530] imagine
[00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.570] being
[00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:46.730] on
[00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.850] one
[00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.930] of
[00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:47.070] those
[00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:47.450] surfaces,
[00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:48.430] you
[00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.610] see
[00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:48.790] the
[00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.090] diurnal
[00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.510] rotation
[00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:49.810] here.
[00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:50.010] It's
[00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:50.210] spinning
[00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.490] around
[00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:50.670] its
[00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.030] axis.
[00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.610] And
[00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:51.770] as
[00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:51.970] well,
[00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:52.370] the
[00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.030] seasonal
[00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.510] variation
[00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:53.750] as
[00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.930] it
[00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:54.650] spins
[00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.870] around
[00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:55.030] the
[00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.190] sun.
[00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:56.570] That's
[00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:56.910] important
[00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.190] for
[00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.290] a
[00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.450] number
[00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:57.630] of
[00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:57.970] reasons.
[00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.070] That
[00:11:59.070 --> 00:11:59.290] will
[00:11:59.290 --> 00:11:59.750] determine
[00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.470] how
[00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.810] much
[00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:01.250] sunlight
[00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.530] is
[00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:01.910] normally
[00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.290] incident
[00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:02.630] on
[00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.750] the
[00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.990] planet.
[00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:04.250] If
[00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.410] you
[00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:04.650] are
[00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.530] normally
[00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:05.910] incident,
[00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.130] if
[00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.290] you're
[00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.490] at
[00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:06.690] this
[00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:06.970] exact
[00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:07.250] spot
[00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.450] right
[00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:07.650] here,
[00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:07.870] you're
[00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.170] receiving
[00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:08.370] the
[00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:08.610] sunlight
[00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:08.890] full
[00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:09.110] on.
[00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.470] But
[00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.990] if
[00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.130] you're
[00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.310] up
[00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.470] here
[00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.890] somewhere,
[00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:11.750] your
[00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.750] surface
[00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.090] normal
[00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:13.270] is
[00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:13.950] some
[00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:14.250] vector
[00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:14.510] pointing
[00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:14.690] out
[00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.870] like
[00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.210] that.
[00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.830] You're
[00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:15.950] only
[00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:16.070] going
[00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:16.130] to
[00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.250] be
[00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:16.610] receiving
[00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.890] the
[00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:17.110] cosine
[00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.490] theta
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.520] of
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:18.660] that
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:18.800] amount
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:18.940] of
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.140] sun.
[00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:20.570] So
[00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:20.710] if
[00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.590] you're
[00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.070] an
[00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:22.350] extreme
[00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.710] example,
[00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.850] if
[00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.950] you're
[00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.070] right
[00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.350] here,
[00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.830] you're
[00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:23.930] not
[00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:24.090] going
[00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:24.170] to
[00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:24.330] get
[00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:24.550] any.
[00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.410] But
[00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:25.530] if
[00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:25.670] you're
[00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.750] in
[00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.910] this
[00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:26.150] part
[00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.310] right
[00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.490] here,
[00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:26.590] you're
[00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.670] going
[00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.750] to
[00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.870] get
[00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:27.230] cosine
[00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.910] of
[00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:29.150] 0,
[00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:29.370] which
[00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:29.470] would
[00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.550] be
[00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.810] 1.
[00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:30.110] So
[00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.230] you
[00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.350] get
[00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.490] the
[00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:30.630] full
[00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:30.790] amount
[00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.930] of
[00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:31.110] sun.
[00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:31.730] And
[00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:32.270] likewise,
[00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:32.670] as
[00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.750] you
[00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.890] move
[00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:33.030] through
[00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.150] the
[00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.350] angles
[00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.570] here.
[00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:33.990] So
[00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.110] it's
[00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.490] important
[00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.890] to
[00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:35.290] understand
[00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:35.490] what
[00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:35.650] the
[00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:35.930] relative
[00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:36.250] angle
[00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:36.470] is
[00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.850] between
[00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.390] our
[00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:37.710] surface
[00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.030] normal
[00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.350] and
[00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.590] the
[00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.790] vector
[00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.070] pointing
[00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:39.170] at
[00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.310] the
[00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.470] sun.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.020] That
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.420] varies
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:41.600] as
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:41.720] a
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:41.900] function
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.100] of
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.360] season.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:42.580] It
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:42.820] varies
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:42.980] as
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.080] a
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:43.260] function
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:43.420] of
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:43.620] time
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:43.760] of
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:43.960] day.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.460] And
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:45.860] obviously,
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.400] over
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:46.580] the
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:46.820] entire
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.100] Earth,
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:47.860] you
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.040] can
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.560] define
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.360] the
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.220] precise
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:50.920] amount
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.060] of
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.280] sunlight
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.540] coming
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:51.660] in,
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:51.760] the

[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:52.840] by
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.020] a
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:53.220] series
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:53.700] of
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:53.880] trig
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.360] formulae.
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:54.900] It
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.040] gets
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.260] pretty
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:55.640] complex.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:55.840] And
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.300] this
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:56.580] website
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:56.760] will
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:56.960] actually
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.180] walk
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.300] you
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:57.440] through
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:57.600] it
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:57.800] if
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:57.940] you're
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.160] so
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:58.760] interested.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.200] Now,
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:00.560] this
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:00.700] is
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:00.840] all
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.200] review,
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:01.640] since

[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:02.880] reading,
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.120] right?
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:03.920] All
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:04.040] done
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.140] the

[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:04.660] reading,
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.260] expect
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:05.440] you
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:05.520] to
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:05.720] before
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.080] class.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.840] Let
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.340] me
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:07.560] ask
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:07.660] you
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:07.780] a
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.020] few
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.580] trickier
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.000] questions,
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.260] just
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:09.380] to
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:09.540] see
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:09.700] if
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:09.940] our
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.400] creative
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:10.660] juices
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:10.880] are
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.180] really
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:11.580] moving
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:11.740] at
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:11.900] this
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.160] early
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.400] time
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:12.540] of
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:12.720] day.
[00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:14.250] When
[00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:14.470] would
[00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.890] be
[00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.890] the
[00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:16.510] shortest
[00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:16.750] day
[00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.870] of
[00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.930] the
[00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.030] year?
[00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.230] Let's
[00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.410] start
[00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:17.610] there.
[00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.930] The
[00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:18.130] shortest
[00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:18.290] day
[00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.390] of
[00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:18.450] the
[00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:18.570] year
[00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:18.710] is
[00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.050] approximately
[00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.410] December
[00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:20.090] 22nd,
[00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.270] right,
[00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.590] in
[00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.710] the
[00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.910] Celsius.
[00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.110] When
[00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.450] is
[00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:22.710] the
[00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.430] earliest,
[00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.790] sorry,
[00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:25.010] when
[00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:25.150] is
[00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.350] the
[00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.730] latest
[00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.530] sunrise?
[00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.730] And
[00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:27.870] when
[00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:28.050] is
[00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.230] the
[00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.570] earliest
[00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.110] sunset?
[00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:32.970] You
[00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:33.130] might
[00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:33.270] need
[00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:33.390] to
[00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:33.550] pick
[00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.690] up
[00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:33.830] your
[00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:34.010] little
[00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:34.290] ball
[00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:34.430] and
[00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.690] rotate
[00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:34.830] it
[00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:35.090] around.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:38.520] Does
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:38.740] anybody
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:38.940] have
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.340] even
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:39.960] just
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.120] a
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.280] gut
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:40.540] sense?
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:40.700] Would
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:40.840] it
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.000] be
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.020] on
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.140] the
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:42.500] solstice?
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:42.680] How
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:42.820] many
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.000] people
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.200] think
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.340] it's
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:43.420] going
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:43.480] to
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:43.600] be
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:43.940] exactly
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.100] on
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.240] the
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.640] solstice?
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:45.360] Let's
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:45.440] see,
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:45.800] earliest
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.120] sunset.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.140] How
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:47.260] many
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.520] people
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:47.740] think
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:47.860] that
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:47.960] the
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.200] earliest
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:48.580] sunset's

[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:48.940] a
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.060] little
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:49.220] bit
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.580] before

[00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:53.490] And
[00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:53.590] no,
[00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:53.770] people
[00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:53.930] don't
[00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:54.090] really
[00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:54.230] know.
[00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:55.970] The
[00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:56.370] reality
[00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:56.570] is
[00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:56.690] that

[00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.930] sunset
[00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:58.970] would
[00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:59.170] be
[00:13:59.170 --> 00:13:59.350] a
[00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.470] little

[00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.070] And
[00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:07.350] it
[00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.630] flips
[00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:07.870] in
[00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.250] summertime.
[00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:08.450] time,
[00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.150] it

[00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:09.530] be,
[00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.770] let's
[00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:09.910] see,

[00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:19.190] respectively.
[00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.670] And
[00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.050] you
[00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.170] can
[00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.330] kind
[00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:21.430] of
[00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.590] think
[00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.810] about
[00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.130] that
[00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:22.710] in
[00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.970] terms
[00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:23.150] of
[00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.310] what
[00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.510] is
[00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:23.730] the

[00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:27.830] sun
[00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:28.030] is
[00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.510] directly
[00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.050] overhead
[00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.110] relative
[00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.430] to
[00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.570] our
[00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.130] chronological
[00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:31.390] noon,
[00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:32.150] which
[00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.490] is,
[00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.650] I
[00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.770] would
[00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:34.010] say,
[00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:34.590] less
[00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.910] dependent
[00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:35.130] on
[00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:35.270] the
[00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:35.570] specific
[00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:35.970] angle
[00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:36.470] of
[00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.710] the
[00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.350] Earth
[00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.730] relative
[00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.830] to
[00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:37.990] the
[00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.150] sun
[00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.250] as
[00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:38.330] it
[00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:38.470] moves
[00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.670] around
[00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.830] this
[00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.170] trajectory.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:41.300] Let's
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:41.460] get
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:41.620] more
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:41.760] into
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:41.900] that
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.000] in
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.480] recitation.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:42.940] I
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.220] sense,
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:43.480] since
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:43.660] there
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:43.840] wasn't
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.020] much
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:44.380] traction
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:44.540] there,
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:44.640] I
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:44.760] don't
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:44.880] want
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.000] to
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.300] dwell.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.400] OK.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.480] Good,
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:49.880] good,
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.080] good.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:51.460] OK.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:53.640] Let's
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:53.860] think
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.000] a
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.080] little
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.320] bit
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:54.720] more
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:54.880] in
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.200] terms
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:55.460] of
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.280] the
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.380] trajectory
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:14:59.560] of
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:14:59.680] the
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:14:59.840] sun
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.060] later
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:00.240] on
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:00.340] as
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:00.460] we
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:00.720] move
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.040] through
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.720] some
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:01.800] of
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:01.920] the
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.220] introductory
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:02.680] material.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:02.980] I
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:03.120] don't
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.280] want
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:03.560] to
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.600] dwell
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:04.820] too
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.020] much.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:05.140] I
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:05.240] want
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.340] to
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:05.440] give
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:05.540] a
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:05.620] little
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:05.760] bit
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:05.860] of
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.080] review
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:06.300] since
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:06.720] I'm
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.080] sensing
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.420] that
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.680] not
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.000] everybody
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.200] did
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.320] the
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:09.540] readings.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.000] I
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.380] expect
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:10.480] you
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:10.580] to
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:10.660] do
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:10.760] the
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:10.960] readings,
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:11.280] folks,
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:11.580] so
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:11.840] let's
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.340] keep
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:12.480] with
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:12.580] me
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:12.720] here.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:13.500] So
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.060] a
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:14.200] touch
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:14.340] of
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:14.620] history,
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:14.860] since
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:15.020] that
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.380] was
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.200] asked
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:16.400] for,
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:16.500] it
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:16.640] was
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.060] requested,
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:17.640] I
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:17.940] decided
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:18.300] to
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:18.760] launch
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:18.920] a
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.040] little
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:19.200] bit
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.560] into
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.220] a
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:20.440] history
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:20.880] of
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.300] the
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:21.520] study
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:21.660] of
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:21.780] the
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:21.960] sun.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.380] Philosophers,
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:23.820] going
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.120] back
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.440] to
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.240] what
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.340] I
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:26.540] suppose
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:26.840] most
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.000] would
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.360] consider
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:27.700] early
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.060] India,
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.060] studied
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:29.280] the
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:29.480] sun.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:30.380] There
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:30.540] were
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:30.940] some
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.100] writings
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.240] of
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:33.720] some
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:33.800] of
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:33.880] the
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.120] earlier
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:34.640] philosophers
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.000] that
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.180] were
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:35.640] recorded.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:36.520] Some
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:36.720] have
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.140] interpreted
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.420] these
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:37.740] writings
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.020] as
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.240] being
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:38.640] indicative
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.160] of
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.920] perhaps
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.460] heliocentric
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.840] models.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.060] These
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.220] are
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.160] poetry,
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:42.520] folks.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.180] It's
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:45.420] a
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:45.720] very
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.020] different
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.400] style
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:46.580] of
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.100] communication
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:47.320] than
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:47.440] what
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:47.600] we
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:47.780] have
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.040] today
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:48.200] of
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.480] technical
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:48.840] writing.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:49.580] So
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:49.720] it's
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.000] difficult
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.240] for
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:50.380] us
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:50.540] to
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:50.820] discern,
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:50.960] or
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.180] difficult
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:51.400] for
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:51.560] me
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:51.680] at
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:51.800] least,
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:51.940] to
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:52.160] discern
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.320] when
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:52.440] I
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:52.660] read
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.560] the
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:53.800] lines
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.300] verbatim
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:54.940] if
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.120] this
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.260] is
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:55.560] really
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.080] somebody
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:58.420] thinking
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:58.660] about
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:58.780] the
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.160] heliocentric
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:15:59.520] model,
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.020] or
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:00.220] whether
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:00.480] this
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:00.800] is
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.400] somebody
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:01.680] just
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:02.560] describing
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:02.740] the
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.000] universe
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.140] in
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:03.220] the
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:03.400] best
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:03.500] of
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:03.580] their
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:03.980] abilities.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:07.740] I
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:07.880] would
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.000] say
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.100] the

[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.340] carefully
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:31.740] plotted

[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:34.920] up
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.040] with
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.200] some
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.300] of

[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:36.640] that
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.120] described
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.980] the

[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.340] And
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:40.480] it's
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:40.760] largely
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.100] credited
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:41.540] with
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.300] developing
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:42.500] a
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:42.700] series
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:42.920] of

[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:46.440] So
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.200] a

[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:50.400] really
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:50.800] essential.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.100] These
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.540] ideas
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.280] didn't
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:52.800] develop
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:52.940] in
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.380] isolation.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:53.580] They
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:53.760] were
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.340] flowing
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:54.740] throughout
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.460] the
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:55.740] world.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:56.780] It's
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.160] important
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.400] to
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:57.540] know
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:57.760] that
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.020] many
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:58.120] of
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:58.240] the
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:58.580] scientists
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:58.820] were
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:17:59.000] well
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.360]-traveled
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:17:59.920] polyglots,
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:00.380] meaning
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:00.560] they
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:00.800] spoke
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.100] different
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.400] languages.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:01.900] And
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.060] that's
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.160] how
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.280] they
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.380] were
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:02.540] able
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:02.720] to
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.040] interpret
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.520] the
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:03.740] texts
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:03.880] and
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.080] readings
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.240] of
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.400] other
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.260] people.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:06.040] And
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:06.200] it's
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:06.400] also
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:06.640] to
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:06.820] note
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.100] that
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:07.520] parallel
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.060] astronomical
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:08.640] developments
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:08.840] were
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.160] happening
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.520] in
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:09.820] other
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:10.320] regions
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:10.480] of
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:10.580] the
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:10.840] world,
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:11.760] the
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:11.980] Far
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.280] East,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.180] Mesoamerica,
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:13.340] and
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:13.500] so
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:13.840] forth.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:14.600] And
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:14.880] so
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.660] obviously,
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:16.880] there
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.420] may
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:17.560] have
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:17.760] been
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.060] some
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.100] communication,
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:19.600] I
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:19.740] would
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:19.860] say,
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.140] rather
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.180] sparse
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:21.580] between,
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.700] especially
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:22.860] with
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.280] the
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:23.480] Far
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:23.700] East.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:23.960] But
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.560] there
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:24.960] was
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.180] a
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:25.400] fair
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:25.540] amount
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:25.640] of
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.100] communication
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:26.620] between
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.200] these
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:28.500] regions
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:28.780] here.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:28.920] And
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.020] you
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.140] can
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:29.480] imagine
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.080] writings
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.240] or
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:30.540] ideas
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:30.980] traveling
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.320] from
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:31.640] word
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:31.780] of
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.020] mouth
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.060] along
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.620] trade
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:33.840] routes.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:34.420] So
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:34.560] there
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.600] was
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.100] some
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:36.560] communication.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:37.320] So
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:37.500] back
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:37.620] to
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:37.720] our
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:37.900] learning
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.260] objectives.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:38.580] Today,
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:38.780] we're
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.040] about
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.300] to
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:39.740] quantify
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.000] the
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.260] available
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:40.500] solar
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:40.900] resource
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.300] relative
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:41.480] to
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:41.660] human
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:41.980] energies
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.420] and
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:42.620] other
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:42.820] fuel
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.220] sources.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:43.800] So
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:43.900] let's
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.020] do
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:44.200] that.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:44.460] We'll
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:44.620] jump
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:44.780] right
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.020] into
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.240] one
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.300] of
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:45.400] the
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:45.620] slides
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:45.720] that
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:45.800] I
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:45.960] showed
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.060] you
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.280] last
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:46.580] time.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.380] This
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:47.540] is
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:47.680] in
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:47.940] terms
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.220] of
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:48.880] terawatts
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.240] av.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.920] Terawatts
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.220] is
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:50.500] a
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:50.660] unit
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:50.840] of
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.140] power,
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:51.980] a
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.100] very
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:52.280] big
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:52.460] one.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.040] Tera
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:53.400] is
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:53.620] 10

[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:53.820] the
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.120] 12.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:55.940] And
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:56.460] you
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:56.600] can
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:56.760] see
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:56.980] here
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.140] the
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:57.520] resource
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:57.680] of
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:57.800] the

[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:58.480] to

[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:00.480] relative
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:00.680] to

[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.140] energy
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:01.440] needs.
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.100] If
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:02.400] we
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:02.940] just
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.340] consider
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:03.620] the
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.060] resource
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.380] falling
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:04.520] on
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:04.620] the
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:04.940] Earth's
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.340] surface
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.640] as
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:05.800] opposed
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:05.960] to
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.080] that
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:06.320] falling
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:06.420] in
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:06.520] the
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:06.700] outer
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.140] atmosphere,
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.080] there's
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.180] a
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.280] little
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.420] bit
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:08.500] of
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:08.580] a
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:08.880] discount.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.080] But
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:09.240] we're
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:09.520] still
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.740] very
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.060] large
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:11.400] compared
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:11.580] to
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:11.760] human
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.000] energy
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.280] use.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:12.760] And
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:12.880] if
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.000] we
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.560] redefine
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:13.720] our
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.080] units
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.760] from

[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:15.480] into

[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:16.440] which
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:16.680] are
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.380] human

[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.300] So
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.760] this

[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:57.620] We

[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:05.540] So

[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:07.620] we

[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.440] effect,
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:49.780] because
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.480] the
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:50.840] total
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.200] surface

[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:51.720] of
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:51.880] that
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.180] sphere
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:52.680] is
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.160] increasing,
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:53.760] obviously,
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:53.900] as
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.080] r
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.460] squared.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.100] And
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:55.180] so
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:55.300] by
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:55.420] the
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:55.660] time
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:55.820] that

[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.280] light
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:56.660] reaches
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:56.880] the

[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:57.720] it's
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:57.860] only
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.000] a

[00:20:59.640 --> 00:20:59.800] or
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:20:59.980] a
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:00.120] very
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:00.340] small
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:00.680] solid
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.020] angle,
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:01.400] to
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:01.500] be
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:01.680] more
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.060] precise,
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:02.700] of
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.180] the

[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:03.860] surface
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:04.440] that
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:04.600] is
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.020] radiating
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.440] directly
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:05.700] at
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:05.840] the

[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:06.240] right
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.480] here.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.320] Because
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:07.840] this,
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:07.940] in
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:08.060] the
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:08.280] absence
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:08.520] of

[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:09.820] that
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:09.980] might
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.340] reflect
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:10.480] or
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:10.720] bounce
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:10.840] the

[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:13.100] And
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:13.200] you
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:13.320] can
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:13.640] calculate
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:13.820] the
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.000] total
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.300] power
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:14.580] incident
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:14.760] on

[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.120] Earth
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:15.460] by
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:15.660] that
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:15.980] simple
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.320] formula
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:16.560] right
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:16.760] there.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.340] What
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:17.480] is
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:17.700] the
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:17.980] radius
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.340] of
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:18.500] the
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:18.740] Earth?
[00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:20.270] Again,
[00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.470] one
[00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.550] of
[00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:20.710] these
[00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.030] simple
[00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.030] numbers
[00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.230] you
[00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.370] should
[00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.530] kind
[00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:22.610] of
[00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.890] have
[00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:22.970] in
[00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:23.070] your
[00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.230] head,
[00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.890] 6
[00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:25.090],370
[00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:25.470] kilometers,
[00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.690] some
[00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:25.770] in
[00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:25.890] that
[00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:26.070] order.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.080] And
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.200] so
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:27.320] you
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:27.460] can
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:27.960] begin
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.840] estimating
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.980] here
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.260] the
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:30.600] total
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.340] power
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:31.460] on
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:31.560] the
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:31.780] order
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.440] of
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:32.720] magnitude.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:33.180] It's
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:33.280] going
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:33.340] to
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:33.460] be
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:33.740] tiny
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.560] compared
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:34.740] to
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:34.860] the
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:34.980] total
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.220] power
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:35.340] that
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:35.460] the
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:35.600] sun
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:35.720] is
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.060] radiating,
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:36.520] thankfully,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.180] or
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:37.320] else
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:37.460] we'd
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:37.640] be
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.100] pretty
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:38.280] hot
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:38.420] right
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:38.560] now.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:39.380] So
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.380] the
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.360] average
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.960] power
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.280] coming
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:43.440] from
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:43.600] the
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:43.820] sun
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.100] on
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.280] the

[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.300] of

[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:48.400] watts
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.580] per
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:48.780] square
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.000] meter.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.160] Who's
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:50.300] heard
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:50.460] of

[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.300],366
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:51.680] before?
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:52.300] Yeah,
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:52.500] you've
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:52.600] heard
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:52.800] about
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:52.940] it?
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.140] All
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:53.260] right,
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:53.620] you
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:53.740] know
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:53.840] where
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:53.920] the
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.100] number
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:54.320] comes
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:54.460] from
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:54.660] now.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:55.340] It's
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:55.540] pretty,
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:55.740] pretty
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.020] wonky.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.160] 1
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:57.600],366
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:57.820] is
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:57.980] a

[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:58.520] company,
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.060] a

[00:21:59.500 --> 00:21:59.800] MIT
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.300] focused

[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:00.960] energy.
[00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.530] OK,
[00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.910] and
[00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:03.250] so
[00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.370] that's
[00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.670] at
[00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:04.810] the

[00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:06.090] we
[00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:06.290] just
[00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:06.570] learned

[00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.230] occurring
[00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.490] somewhere
[00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.730] around
[00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.050] March
[00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:08.810] 21,
[00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.170] September
[00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:10.650] 21,
[00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:11.010] coming
[00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:11.170] up
[00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:11.370] soon,
[00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.030] celebration.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.600] The
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:13.900] ratio
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.120] of

[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:15.680] is
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:15.840] really
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.100] something
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.260] to
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:16.400] keep
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:16.520] in
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:16.680] mind
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:16.840] right
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.000] there.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:18.760] OK,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.200] so
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.820] we've
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.420] quantified
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:20.600] the
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:20.860] available
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.580] resource
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:21.920] relative
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.100] to
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:22.280] human
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:22.540] energy
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:22.840] needs.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:23.600] Now
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.120] we
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.320] have
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:25.420] to
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:25.560] come
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:25.660] up
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:25.780] with
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:25.980] some
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.260] language
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:26.540] that
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:26.700] we
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:26.920] use
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.060] to
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.560] describe
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:27.880] the
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.160] sunlight
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.620] moving
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:28.960] through
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.200] the
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:29.560] atmosphere
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:29.740] of
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:29.860] the
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.040] Earth
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:30.640] and
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:30.940] reaching
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.160] the
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:31.380] surface
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:31.600] of
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:31.700] the
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:31.880] Earth.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:32.900] So
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.260] we're
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:33.440] going
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:33.580] to
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:33.760] use
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:33.960] what's
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.180] called
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:34.360] the
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:34.560] Air
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:34.800] Mass
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.280] Convention,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:35.460] or
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:35.920] AM
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.480] Convention.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:36.900] AM
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.240] stands
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:37.440] for
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:37.580] Air
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:37.900] Mass.
[00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:39.690] Even
[00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:39.950] without
[00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:40.190] knowing
[00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.390] much
[00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.570] about
[00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:40.790] how
[00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:40.930] the
[00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:41.070] light
[00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.190] is
[00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.470] absorbed
[00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.650] or
[00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:41.750] how
[00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.850] to
[00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:42.150] quantify
[00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:42.350] it
[00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.770] mathematically,
[00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.410] we
[00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:43.530] can
[00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:43.850] assume
[00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:44.010] that
[00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.150] our
[00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:45.510] atmosphere
[00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.110] contains
[00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.850] molecules.
[00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.050] It
[00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:47.370] contains
[00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:47.870] particulate
[00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.150] matter.
[00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:48.590] And
[00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.710] that's
[00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.830] going
[00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.970] to
[00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:49.230] interact
[00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.390] with
[00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.510] the
[00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.650] light
[00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:49.790] in
[00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:49.970] some
[00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:50.170] way.
[00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.330] It's
[00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.550] probably
[00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:50.710] going
[00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.790] to
[00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:50.950] either
[00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:51.290] absorb
[00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:51.470] or
[00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.750] scatter
[00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.950] it.
[00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:52.670] And
[00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:52.790] so
[00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:53.090] as
[00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.290] the
[00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:53.430] light
[00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.770] passes
[00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:54.010] through
[00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.150] our
[00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:54.430] atmosphere,
[00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:54.650] there's
[00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:54.790] going
[00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:54.870] to
[00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.990] be
[00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.170] some
[00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:55.550] absorption.
[00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:56.370] And
[00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:56.690] the
[00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.090] greater
[00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:57.290] the
[00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:57.590] distance,
[00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:57.810] the
[00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:57.950] greater
[00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:58.170] the
[00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:58.570] optical
[00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:58.930] path
[00:22:58.930 --> 00:22:59.150] length
[00:22:59.150 --> 00:22:59.310] through
[00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.450] the
[00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.790] atmosphere,
[00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.250] the
[00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:00.410] more
[00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:00.730] absorption
[00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:01.070] and
[00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.250] more
[00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.570] scattering
[00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:01.730] there
[00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:01.830] will
[00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.990] be.
[00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:02.630] And
[00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.830] so
[00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:03.090] we
[00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:03.310] use
[00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.550] Air
[00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:03.750] Mass,
[00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.930] or
[00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:04.210] AM
[00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:04.670] Convention,
[00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.190] to
[00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.590] define
[00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.110] the
[00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.370] path
[00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:06.590] length
[00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.710] or
[00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.810] the
[00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:07.010] path
[00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.390] distance
[00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.610] through
[00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:07.750] the
[00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:08.070] atmosphere.
[00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:09.130] AM0
[00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.470] would
[00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.650] mean
[00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:09.830] the
[00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:10.050] outer
[00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:10.470] atmosphere.
[00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.670] AM1
[00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:11.850] would
[00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:12.150] be
[00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:12.590] essentially
[00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.790] just
[00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.030] going
[00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.350] straight
[00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.570] through
[00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:14.150] normal
[00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:14.510] incidence
[00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.850] so
[00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:14.990] that
[00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.410] the
[00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:15.790] direction
[00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:15.970] of

[00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.990] trajectory
[00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.130] of
[00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:17.210] the
[00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:17.410] light
[00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:18.150] is
[00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:18.650] parallel
[00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:18.930] to
[00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.150] the

[00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.730] normal
[00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:20.090] of

[00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.450] at
[00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.550] that
[00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:20.910] location.
[00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.690] And
[00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:21.790] then
[00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:21.990] Air
[00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.150] Mass
[00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:22.310] 1
[00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.710].5
[00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.830] and
[00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.970] so
[00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:23.170] forth
[00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:23.290] is
[00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:23.390] as
[00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.490] we
[00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:23.810] increase
[00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.010] the

[00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.010] of

[00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:25.930] of

[00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.330] normal.
[00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:27.550] So
[00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:27.950] in
[00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:28.030] other
[00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:28.150] words,
[00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:28.250] as
[00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.350] we
[00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:28.550] go
[00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.010] further
[00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:29.210] from

[00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.590] number

[00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:31.790] going
[00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:31.890] to
[00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:32.010] go
[00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:32.170] up,
[00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.290] up,
[00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.470] up.
[00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:33.170] OK,
[00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:33.390] we'll
[00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.950] explain
[00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:34.050] it
[00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:34.170] with
[00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:34.270] a
[00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:34.370] few
[00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.650] graphs
[00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:34.830] and
[00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:35.090] figures
[00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.350] and
[00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.770] a
[00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:35.850] few
[00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:36.130] slides.
[00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:36.810] So
[00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:36.890] we
[00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:37.010] have
[00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.110] our
[00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.430] atmospheric
[00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.010] absorption.
[00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:39.510] When
[00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.590] you
[00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.790] just
[00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.150] glance
[00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:40.270] at
[00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:40.410] the
[00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:40.650] Earth
[00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:40.850] and
[00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.990] these
[00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.430] beautiful
[00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.270] pictures
[00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:42.670] taken
[00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:42.870] from
[00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:43.030] outer
[00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:43.430] space,
[00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.910] we
[00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:44.070] can
[00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.310] see
[00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.290] very
[00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:45.630] obviously
[00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.850] the
[00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:46.170] clouds
[00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:46.610] present.
[00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.790] And
[00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:48.230] more
[00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.690] importantly,
[00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:49.150] if
[00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:49.310] we
[00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.450] were
[00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:49.590] to
[00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.790] zoom
[00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:49.930] in
[00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:50.050] on
[00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:50.150] one
[00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:50.230] of
[00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.370] these
[00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:50.670] regions
[00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:50.890] right
[00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:51.230] here,
[00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:52.070] we
[00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.230] would
[00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.650] see
[00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.990] this
[00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.010] bluish
[00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:56.450] hue
[00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.910] coming
[00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:57.390] from
[00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:58.070] our
[00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.390] atmosphere,
[00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.650] which
[00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:58.790] is
[00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.130] scattering
[00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:00.390] preferentially
[00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.530] the
[00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:00.830] shorter
[00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.230] wavelengths
[00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.410] of
[00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:01.650] light.
[00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.090] And
[00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:03.510] more
[00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.890] importantly,
[00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:04.170] this
[00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:04.490] radius
[00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:04.710] right
[00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.990] here
[00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.190] is
[00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.370] somewhere
[00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:05.470] in
[00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.550] the
[00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:05.730] order
[00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:05.850] of
[00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:06.050] 6
[00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:06.970],370
[00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:07.330] kilometers.
[00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:07.990] And
[00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.190] this
[00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.390] thin
[00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.750] atmospheric
[00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:09.130] shell
[00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:09.250] is
[00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:09.330] in
[00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:09.410] the
[00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:09.530] order
[00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:09.670] of
[00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:09.970] 30.
[00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:12.710] So
[00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.130] that's
[00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.330] why
[00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:13.570] you
[00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:13.710] don't
[00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:13.890] really
[00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:14.130] see
[00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:14.350] too
[00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.530] much
[00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:14.690] of
[00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:15.410] a
[00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:15.630] ring
[00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:16.210] around
[00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:16.330] the
[00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:16.510] planet
[00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.710] from
[00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.870] this
[00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:17.210] distance.
[00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:18.370] So
[00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:18.710] atmospheric
[00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.170] effects.
[00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:19.590] Let's
[00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.970] try
[00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:20.170] to
[00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:20.630] bin
[00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.830] them
[00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:21.270] into
[00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.070] discrete
[00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.350] buckets.
[00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:23.030] This
[00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:23.150] is
[00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:23.270] a
[00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.790] simplification,
[00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:24.090] but
[00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:24.190] it
[00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.410] helps
[00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:24.650] us
[00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:25.090] gain
[00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:25.230] a
[00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.590] foothold
[00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.750] in
[00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.190] understanding.
[00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:26.370] And
[00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:26.470] then
[00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.610] from
[00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:26.770] there,
[00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.930] we
[00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:27.110] can
[00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.910] make
[00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:28.030] our
[00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:28.370] understanding
[00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.610] a
[00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:28.710] bit
[00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.870] more
[00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:29.290] complex.
[00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:30.150] So
[00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:30.270] we
[00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:30.350] have
[00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.710] incoming
[00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.990] solar
[00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.450] radiation
[00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:32.090] coming
[00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.290] from
[00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:32.530] here.
[00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:33.290] We
[00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:33.390] have
[00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:33.470] a
[00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.630] number
[00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:33.870] now
[00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:34.210] that's
[00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:35.650] 342
[00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:35.990] watts
[00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.230] per
[00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.430] square
[00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.650] meter.
[00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:37.630] Why
[00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.730] is
[00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.830] that
[00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:38.110] number
[00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.550] so
[00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:38.750] much
[00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:39.010] lower
[00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:39.210] than
[00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:39.410] the
[00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:39.770] 1
[00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.350],366
[00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.470] that
[00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.570] we
[00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:41.650] were
[00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:41.790] just
[00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:42.070] talking
[00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.330] about?
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.480] Yeah,
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:53.700] so
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:53.880] this
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.020] is
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.180] meant
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.300] to
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:54.740] be
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.120] an
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:55.540] average
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.260] over
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:56.460] the
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:56.720] entire
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.020] day,
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:57.740] one
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.040] fixed
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.360] point
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:58.580] along
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:58.680] the
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:58.920] ground.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:24:59.260] So
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:24:59.360] as
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:24:59.500] we're
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:24:59.780] rotating
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.060] around,
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.240] we
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.420] have
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:00.840] at
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.020] least
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.240] half
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:01.320] of
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:01.400] the
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:01.580] day
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.100] normally
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:02.260] when
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:02.380] we
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:02.480] don't
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:02.600] have
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:02.860] sunlight.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:03.640] And
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:03.820] then
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:04.140] there's,
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:05.260] I
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:05.300] would
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:05.440] say,
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:05.680] the
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:05.980] cosine
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.400] theta
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:06.860] angle
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.060] is
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.320] not
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.100] 1
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:08.580] at
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:08.700] all
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.000] times.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.460] It's
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.240] very
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:10.500] rarely
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:10.740] 1.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:11.340] And
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:11.460] so
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:11.620] this
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:11.760] is
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.000] a
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.280] bit
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:12.360] of
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:12.500] a
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.140] discounted
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.620] incoming
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:13.940] solar
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.380] radiation,
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.040] essentially
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.200] a
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:15.400] time
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:15.740] average
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:15.980] solar
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.340] radiation
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:16.560] for
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:16.640] a
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:16.780] given
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:17.160] patch
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:17.660] of
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.080] the
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:18.360] planet
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.260] over
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:19.400] a
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:19.620] typical
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:19.860] day.
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:20.600] And
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:20.720] so
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:20.860] we
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.120] have
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:21.380] a
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:21.640] variety
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.080] of
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:22.520] processes
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:22.820] here.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:22.980] We
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.180] have
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:23.640] reflection
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.240] off
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:24.480] of
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.040] clouds.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:25.320] That's
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:25.500] pretty
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:25.720] clear
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:25.880] to
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.320] see
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:26.500] from
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:26.680] here.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:27.280] Looks
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:27.500] nice
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:27.620] and
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:27.820] white.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.240] We
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:29.460] have
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:29.660] some
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.040] absorbed
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.240] by
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.380] the
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:30.700] atmosphere,
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:31.780] typically
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.320] in
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.040] rotational
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:33.540] vibrational
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:33.880] modes
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.220] of
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:34.960] molecules
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.540] up
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:35.620] in
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:35.700] the
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:35.820] outer
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.160] atmosphere,
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.180] sometimes
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:37.420] by
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:37.800] particulate
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.040] matter
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.180] as
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:38.400] well.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:39.540] And
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:39.860] then
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.400] we
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:40.800] have
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.700] the
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:41.940] amount
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.120] that's
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.400] absorbed
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:42.640] here
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:42.760] by
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:42.940] the
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.260] surface,
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:43.680] of
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:43.780] course
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.200] reflected
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:44.380] as
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:44.540] well.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:45.500] And
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:45.660] so
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:45.980] the
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:46.300] amount
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:46.520] that's
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:46.920] incident
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.220] on
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:47.380] the
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:47.640] surface
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:47.780] or
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:48.020] coming
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:48.360] down
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:48.600] to
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:48.860] us
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:49.120] is
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.260] what
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:49.360] we
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:49.500] can
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:49.700] actually
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.000] use
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.340] to
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:50.600] make
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.160] solar
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:51.420] energy.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.200] And
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:52.440] this
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:52.580] is
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:52.700] an
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.020] average,
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:53.300] right?
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.560] Because
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:53.940] sometimes
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.120] the
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:54.320] cloud
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.600] cover
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:54.740] is
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:54.840] a
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:54.920] lot
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.240] greater.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.020] And
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.180] for
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:56.380] that
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:56.800] particular
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.140] day,
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:57.880] we
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.060] will
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.360] have
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:58.620] a
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:58.740] lot
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:58.960] less
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.420] resource
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:25:59.880] striking
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.040] the
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:00.300] ground
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:00.560] at
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:00.600] that
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:00.720] given
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:00.980] time.
[00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:02.270] This
[00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:02.470] over
[00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.810] here,
[00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.350] this
[00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.490] is
[00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:03.830] all
[00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.850] mostly
[00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:05.290] infrared,
[00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.670] right?
[00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.870] Where
[00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.050] this
[00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:06.190] is
[00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:06.550] visible
[00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.010] coming
[00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.390] in,
[00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.890] once
[00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:08.010] the
[00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:08.130] light
[00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:08.290] gets
[00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:08.670] absorbed
[00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:08.910] and
[00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:09.030] then
[00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.210] gets
[00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:09.430] re
[00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.730]-emitted,
[00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.510] it
[00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.810] usually
[00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:10.990] gets
[00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.170] re
[00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:11.310]-emitted
[00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.450] in
[00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.550] the
[00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:11.730] longer
[00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:12.130] wavelength
[00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:12.990] light
[00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.450] or
[00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:13.590] the
[00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.810] infrared
[00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:14.090] light.
[00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.850] And
[00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.190] this
[00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.330] is
[00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:15.510] the
[00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.790] stuff
[00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:16.030] that
[00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:16.390] gets
[00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.390] absorbed
[00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.730] by
[00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:19.030] greenhouse
[00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:19.530] gases
[00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:19.690] and
[00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:19.830] then
[00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.970] re
[00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:20.230]-emitted
[00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.470] equiangularly.
[00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.630] And
[00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.790] some
[00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:21.890] of
[00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.010] it
[00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.330] makes
[00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:22.450] its
[00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:22.570] way
[00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:22.830] back
[00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:23.090] to
[00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.390] the
[00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:23.570] Earth.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:24.920] OK,
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:25.520] so
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:25.780] air
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.020] mass.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:26.460] Let's
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:26.860] define
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.220] that
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.220] so
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:28.360] that
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:28.520] we
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:28.880] have
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.160] a
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:29.380] common
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:29.720] language
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:29.940] that
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.060] we
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:30.180] can
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:30.360] use
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:30.460] to
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:30.820] describe
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.000] the
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.140] solar
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:31.540] resource
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:31.720] from
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:31.920] place
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.060] to
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:32.300] place.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.160] So
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:33.380] again,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:33.620] this
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:33.760] is
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:33.900] the
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.120] sun.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:34.960] This
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.100] is
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:35.320] the
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:35.600] surface
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:35.860] right
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.180] here.
[00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.390] And
[00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:37.610] let's
[00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.930] imagine
[00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:38.170] that
[00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:38.450] the

[00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:41.310] sunlight
[00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.890] and
[00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:42.030] the
[00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:42.290] surface
[00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:42.670] normal
[00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:43.390] is
[00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:43.710] 0,
[00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:44.310] such

[00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:45.530] term
[00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:45.770] is
[00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.070] 1.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.180] Air
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:47.420] mass
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:47.680] here
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:47.940] at
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.160] this
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:48.520] point
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.520] on
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:49.640] the
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:49.860] surface
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.020] of

[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:50.260] Earth
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:50.740] is

[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.220] AM1.
[00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:53.390] So
[00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.550] we
[00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:53.710] call
[00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.830] it
[00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.170] air
[00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:54.410] mass
[00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:54.790] 1
[00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:55.070] if
[00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.230] the

[00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.570] is

[00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:56.930] overhead.
[00:26:59.410 --> 00:26:59.690] What
[00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.810] did
[00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.930] we
[00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:00.110] learn
[00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.270] about

[00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:01.350] of
[00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.450] the
[00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:01.690] Earth?
[00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:02.190] It's
[00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.410] about

[00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:03.370] half

[00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:04.050] right?
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.060] How
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.260] far
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:05.540] north
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:05.680] are
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:05.840] we?
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.520] What
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:06.660] is
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.220] our
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:07.540] latitude
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:07.820] here
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:07.960] in
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.240] Boston?
[00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:10.330] 41,
[00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:10.770] 42
[00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.050]-ish,
[00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.270] right?
[00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.870] So
[00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:12.110] let's,
[00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:12.410] for

[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.480] here
[00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:17.330] in
[00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.650] Boston,
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:19.780] our

[00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.470] And
[00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.690] let's
[00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:28.830] say
[00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:28.970] that

[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.080] is
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:37.960] approximately
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.440] 23
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:38.600] and

[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.500] So
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.400] what
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:42.620] would
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:42.980] be

[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.360] What
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:56.560] would
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:56.780] the

[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.220] How

[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.300] south
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:02.540] would

[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:07.360] So

[00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:39.150] Boston.
[00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:40.090] This
[00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:40.290] is
[00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:40.650] south,
[00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:41.050] and
[00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:41.290] that's
[00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:41.590] north.
[00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:42.590] And
[00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.970] we're
[00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:43.130] at
[00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.290] the
[00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:43.470] solar
[00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:43.730] noon
[00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:44.230] in
[00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.370] the
[00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:44.570] winter
[00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:45.010] solstice
[00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:45.130] and
[00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:45.250] the
[00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:45.430] summer
[00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.870] solstice.
[00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.450] So
[00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:46.830] here's
[00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:47.670] you.
[00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.350] This
[00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.690] is
[00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:49.290] directly
[00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:49.670] above.
[00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:50.430] So
[00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.790] let's
[00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:50.930] say
[00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:51.070] if
[00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.210] you're
[00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:51.390] lying
[00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:51.490] on
[00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:51.570] your
[00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:51.830] back
[00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.930] and
[00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:52.130] looking
[00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:52.390] straight
[00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:52.550] up,
[00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.770] that's
[00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:52.890] the
[00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:53.130] surface
[00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:53.430] normal
[00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.970] of
[00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:54.110] the
[00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.310] Earth.
[00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.790] In
[00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:55.670] the
[00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:55.990] summer,
[00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:56.370] at
[00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:56.590] solar
[00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.910] noon,
[00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:57.550] the
[00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:57.690] sun
[00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:57.830] would
[00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.950] be
[00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:58.090] at
[00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:58.350] what
[00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.670] angle
[00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:59.090] relative
[00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.550] to
[00:28:59.550 --> 00:28:59.830] the
[00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.090] surface
[00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:00.350] normal
[00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.510] of
[00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:00.570] the
[00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:00.750] Earth?
[00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:03.210] 17
[00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:03.410] and
[00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:03.530] 1
[00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:03.550] half,
[00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:03.810] somewhere
[00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:03.990] around
[00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.130] there.
[00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.530] And
[00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:04.630] how
[00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.710] did
[00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.770] you
[00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:04.910] get
[00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:05.030] that
[00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:05.250] number?
[00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:07.090] Subtract
[00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:07.310] those
[00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.530] two,
[00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.770] right?
[00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:08.150] So
[00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:08.270] you
[00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:08.470] get
[00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.950] 41
[00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:09.310] minus
[00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.750] 23
[00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.910] and
[00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:09.990] 1
[00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.150] half.
[00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:10.430] You're
[00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.890] somewhere
[00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.330] around
[00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:12.450] 17,
[00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:12.810] 18,
[00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:13.190] somewhere
[00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.350] around
[00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.490] there.
[00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.430] So
[00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.590] we'll
[00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.750] call
[00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.850] it
[00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:15.110] 18
[00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.550] degrees
[00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:15.810] in
[00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.110] summer,
[00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:17.110] again,
[00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.470] relative
[00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.710] to
[00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:17.890] the
[00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:18.110] surface
[00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.410] normal.
[00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:19.530] And
[00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:19.810] in
[00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:20.330] wintertime,
[00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:20.890] what
[00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:21.050] is
[00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.930] that
[00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:23.370] work
[00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:23.510] out
[00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.650] to
[00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:23.790] be?
[00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:25.850] 64
[00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:26.130] and
[00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:26.230] 1
[00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.330] half.
[00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.710] Similar
[00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:27.130] logic,
[00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:27.350] right?
[00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:27.550] So
[00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:27.670] we'll
[00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:27.810] call
[00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:27.910] it
[00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:28.330] 65
[00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:28.790] degrees
[00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:29.570] in
[00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.810] winter.
[00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:30.550] Good.
[00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:31.310] So
[00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:32.110] what
[00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.290] does
[00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:32.470] that
[00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.690] work
[00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:32.850] out
[00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:32.970] to
[00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:33.090] be
[00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:33.210] in
[00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:33.430] terms
[00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.610] of
[00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:33.790] air
[00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:34.050] mass
[00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:34.630] for
[00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.070] winter
[00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.670] and
[00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:35.910] summer?
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:38.740] Quick
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.120] engineering
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.640] approximation,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.000] I'm
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:40.080] going
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.160] to
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:40.320] say
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:40.460] that
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:40.600] in
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:40.840] summer
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.080] it's
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.520] approximately
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:41.760] air
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:41.940] mass
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.160] 1,
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:42.360] but
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:42.480] you
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:42.620] can
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:42.960] calculate
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.100] it
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:43.220] real
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:43.420] quick.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:43.660] Somebody
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:43.800] with
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:43.920] a
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.300] calculator,
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:44.500] want
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:44.580] to
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:44.760] plug
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:44.940] those
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.120] in?
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:45.460] AUDIENCE
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:45.460] MEMBER
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:45.460] 2
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:45.460] And
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:45.720] roughly
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:45.940] 2.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.380] And
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:47.620] roughly
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:47.840] 2
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.000] in
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:48.240] winter,
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.060] right?
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.500] OK.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.460] We're
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:52.540] going
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:52.600] to
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:52.740] get
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:52.980] into
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:53.420] scattering
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:53.920] of
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.280] light
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.300] in
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:55.740] next
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.080] lecture,
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:56.420] actually.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.060] And
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:57.400] we'll
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:57.760] see
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.200] why
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.400] that
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:58.740] matters
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:58.920] in
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.100] terms,
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:29:59.440] especially
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:29:59.580] of
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:29:59.720] getting
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.500] sunburned,
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:00.860] since
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.100] the
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:01.360] shorter
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:01.860] wavelengths,
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:02.340] the
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:02.860] ultraviolet,
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:02.960] are
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.140] more
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:03.500] sensitive
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.300] to
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:04.440] the
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:04.660] path
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:04.840] length.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:06.100] OK.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:08.520] Good.
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:08.960] Very
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.120] good.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:09.320] So
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:09.480] we
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:09.780] have
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.040] pretty
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:11.240] much
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:11.580] a
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:11.800] gut
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.100] sense
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.420] now
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:12.640] of
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:12.760] where
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:12.940] the
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:13.100] sun
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:13.240] is
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:13.340] in
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:13.480] the
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:13.720] sky.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.300] And
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:14.420] as
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:14.540] it
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:14.860] moves
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.060] from
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:15.320] summer
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:15.560] to
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:15.820] winter,
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.120] from
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:16.380] our
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:16.840] perspective,
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.040] it
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:18.360] follows
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:18.500] a
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:18.580] little
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:18.740] bit
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:18.840] of
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.540] a
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.920] sinusoidal
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.240] path,
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:21.400] right?
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:21.700] It
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.220] stays
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:22.400] in
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:22.660] summer
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:22.920] for
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.040] a
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.200] long
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:23.400] period
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:23.540] of
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:23.780] time
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:23.980] up
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:24.280] here,
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:24.800] and
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:24.920] then
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.020] it
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.380] moves
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:25.640] pretty
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:25.920] quickly
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.160] down
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:26.480] here
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:26.620] and
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:26.900] stays
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.200] here.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:27.360] So
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.040] versus
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.540] time,
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.340] the
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:29.780] angle
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:29.940] of
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.060] the
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:30.200] sun
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:30.300] in
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:30.400] the
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:30.600] sky
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:30.760] is
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.080] following
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.440] a
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:31.620] sine
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:31.840] curve,
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:32.160] or
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.380] cosine
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:32.720] curve,
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:32.840] if
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:32.920] you
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.100] will.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.380] And
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:34.680] so
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.280] right
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:35.640] now,
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.020] the
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:36.160] sun
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:36.320] is
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:36.660] actually
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.460] close
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:37.580] to
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:37.720] the
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:37.900] middle.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:38.660] We're
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:38.800] in
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.100] September
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:39.820] 13th.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:40.280] The
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:40.600] solstice
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:40.780] is
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.020] coming
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:41.200] up
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.300] in
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:41.380] a
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:41.600] week's
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:41.860] time.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:42.960] And
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.140] so
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:43.520] the
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.160] slope
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:44.400] of
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:44.580] that
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:44.860] sine
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:45.120] curve
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:45.300] is
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:45.460] at
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:45.600] a
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:45.960] maximum
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.620] right
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:46.820] about
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:47.080] now.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:47.720] And
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:47.860] so
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.380] the
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:48.860] amount
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:49.300] of
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:49.740] time
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.160] that
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:50.340] the
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:50.540] day
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:50.720] will
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.040] change
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:51.160] in
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.500] length
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:52.360] is
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:52.720] changing
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.160] at
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:53.300] its
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:53.520] greatest
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:53.780] point
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:53.960] right
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.200] now
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:54.600] in
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:54.700] the
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:54.820] year.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:55.760] And
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:55.840] so
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:55.920] you
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.140] really
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:56.400] begin
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:56.520] to
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:56.720] notice
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:56.860] it
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:56.960] if
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.040] you
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:57.220] start
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:57.400] paying
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:57.780] attention,
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:58.440] or
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:58.540] if
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:58.620] you
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:58.720] go
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:58.840] to
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.000] weather
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.440].com
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:30:59.560] and
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:30:59.760] start
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.000] looking
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.260] up
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.000] how
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.320] long
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:01.900] is
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:02.260] today's
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:02.440] day
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:02.600] going
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:02.760] to
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.060] last.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:03.920] When
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.080] is
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:04.240] the
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.440] sunset
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:04.840] tomorrow?
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:05.520] I
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:05.600] don't
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:05.680] know
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:05.820] about
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:05.980] you
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:06.200] folks,
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:06.400] but
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:06.500] I
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:06.640] like
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:06.800] to
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.080] cycle.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:07.720] And
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.080] when
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.440] I'm
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:08.860] doing
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.020] my
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.240] evening
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:09.640] rides,
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.200] I'm
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:10.460] noticing
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:10.620] it
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:10.820] now
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:11.360] that
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:11.480] I
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:11.620] have
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:11.760] to
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.200] start
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:12.440] earlier
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:12.560] and
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:12.760] earlier.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:12.920] If
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.020] I
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.120] want
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:13.220] to
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:13.340] put
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:13.500] in,
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:13.680] say,
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.200] 30
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.300] or
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:14.480] 40
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:14.820] miles,
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:15.040] I'm
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:15.160] not
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:15.240] going
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:15.240] to
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:15.300] be
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:15.380] able
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:15.460] to
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:15.600] make
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:15.680] it
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:15.820] home
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:15.940] in
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.100] time.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:17.920] So
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.280] that's
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.520] the
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:19.780] sun
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:19.900] and
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.060] how
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.200] it
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:20.480] relates
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:20.620] to
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:20.820] you
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:20.920] in
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.020] your
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:21.220] daily
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:21.600] lives.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.360] We're
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:23.440] going
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:23.520] to
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:23.680] get
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.600] back
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:24.720] to
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:24.860] this
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:24.940] in
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.020] a
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:25.120] minute.
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:25.280] So
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:25.500] keep
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:25.680] this
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:25.800] in
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:25.960] mind.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:26.520] Don't
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:26.820] let
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:26.940] it
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.040] out
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:27.120] of
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:27.280] your
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:27.480] RAM.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:28.840] Let's
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.040] talk
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.240] about
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:29.380] the
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:29.620] actual
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:29.920] solar
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.300] spectrum
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:30.780] for
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:30.920] a
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.000] minute.
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.040] This
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:32.240] is
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:32.580] the
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:33.180] sunlight
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:33.840] intensity
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.740] in
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:34.960] some
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.220] very
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:35.480] weird
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:35.800] units.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:35.980] We'll
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.080] get
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:36.180] to
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:36.300] that
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:36.400] in
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:36.480] a
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:36.580] minute.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.040] But
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.220] think
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:37.300] of
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:37.460] this
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:37.600] in
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:37.920] terms
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.520] sort
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:38.680] of
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:38.940] like
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.340] the
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:39.540] total
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:39.740] amount
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:39.880] of
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.160] power
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.260] in
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:40.340] a
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:40.500] given
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:40.900] bandwidth.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:41.980] So
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:42.480] the
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.660] wavelength
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:43.980] right
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.120] here,
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:44.240] the
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:44.440] power
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:44.760] density
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:44.860] in
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:44.920] a
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.080] bandwidth,
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:45.560] the
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:45.920] wavelength
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.320] is
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:46.460] the
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:46.700] wavelength
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:46.960] of
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.240] light.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:47.860] Shown
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:48.080] for
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.220] your
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:48.520] convenience
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:48.820] here
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.140] is
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:49.320] the
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:49.600] visible
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.020] spectrum.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:50.380] That's
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.620] mostly
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:51.820] what
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:51.920] our
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.040] eye
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:52.180] is
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.320] able
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:52.500] to
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:52.860] detect
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:53.540] in
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:53.900] this
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.420] wavelength
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:54.720] range
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:54.880] right
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.120] here.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:55.640] And
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:55.820] the
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.120] sun
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:56.380] is
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:56.660] emitting
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:56.960] over
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.220] a
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:57.360] much
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:57.780] broader
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.700] range
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:58.860] of
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.240] wavelengths.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:31:59.740] It's
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.000] emitting
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.400] following
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:00.680] a

[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.440],000
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:04.760] Kelvin.
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:05.280] In
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:05.460] essence,
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:05.720] this
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.000] very
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.320] difficult
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:06.520] to
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:06.700] see
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:06.960] green
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.200] line
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.380] right
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:07.580] there.
[00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:08.950] Air
[00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:09.230] mass
[00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.790] zero
[00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:10.330] spectrum
[00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.450] looks
[00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:11.730] like
[00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:12.090] this,
[00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.550] this
[00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:12.810] red
[00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:13.010] line
[00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.190] right
[00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.390] here.
[00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.770] And
[00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:13.970] again,
[00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.230] letting
[00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.430] me
[00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.790] remind
[00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:14.910] you
[00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:15.010] that
[00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:15.150] the
[00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:15.270] air
[00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:15.470] mass
[00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.730] zero
[00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:16.030] is
[00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:16.170] the
[00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:16.330] light
[00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:16.510] that's
[00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:16.730] falling
[00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.890] in
[00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:17.030] the
[00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:17.310] outer
[00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.790] atmosphere.
[00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:17.990] There
[00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.570] is
[00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:18.870] no
[00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.070] Earth
[00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.590] atmospheric
[00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.010] absorption
[00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:21.230] yet.
[00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:21.670] Why
[00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:21.830] do
[00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.970] we
[00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:22.310] have
[00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.830] these
[00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:23.090] little
[00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.650] lines
[00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:23.870] here?
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:25.140] You
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:25.360] see
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:25.560] it's
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:25.720] not
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:25.840] a
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.080] perfect
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:26.660] blackbody.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.020] We
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:27.220] have
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:27.580] some,
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.220] I'll
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:28.320] give
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:28.400] you
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:28.460] a
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:28.660] hint,
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.220] absorption
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:29.740] lines.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:30.860] Where
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.040] is
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.180] that
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:31.360] light
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:31.580] being
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:31.880] absorbed?
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:32.500] Is
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.120] it
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:33.380] the
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:33.800] ether
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.200] between

[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:34.620] and
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:34.740] the

[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:36.000] No,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.100] there's
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:36.220] no
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:36.400] ether
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:36.720] between
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:36.820] the
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:36.880] Earth
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:36.980] and
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:37.060] the
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:37.060] sun.
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:37.220] Where
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:37.440] is
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:37.560] that
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:37.720] light
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:37.840] being
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.060] absorbed?
[00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:40.310] In
[00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.570] the
[00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:40.710] sun
[00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:41.110] itself,
[00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.670] right?
[00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:42.050] So
[00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:42.350] these
[00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.530] are
[00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:42.950] absorption

[00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:45.430] atmosphere.
[00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.990] And
[00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.450] now
[00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:47.110] if
[00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.250] we
[00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:47.490] do

[00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:48.330] one,

[00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.570].5,
[00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:50.070] let's
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:50.900] push
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:51.000] it
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:51.120] up
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:51.220] a

[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.180] mass
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:52.680] zero,
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:53.420] this
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:53.560] is
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:53.900] now
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.740] passing
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:55.000] through
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.100] an
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:55.320] angle
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:55.580] somewhere
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:55.780] around
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.020] 60
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:56.480] degrees.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:57.760] Now
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.140] what
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:58.280] do
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:58.420] we
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:58.740] have?
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:58.900] We
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:32:59.280] have
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.900] several
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.340] absorption
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:01.900] lines
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.600] occurring,
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:02.920] right?
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:03.440] And
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:03.660] these
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.080] correspond
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:04.300] to
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:04.620] absorption
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.020] events
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:05.260] where?
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.440] In
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:07.560] the
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:07.700] Earth's
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.040] atmosphere,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:08.540] exactly.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:09.220] And
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:09.360] so
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:09.500] we
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:09.600] can
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:09.880] attribute
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.240] each

[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:10.480] these
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:10.740] little

[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:11.680] lines
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:11.920] here
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.080] to
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:12.220] a
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:12.560] particular,
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.020] usually
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:13.180] it's
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:13.300] a
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:13.600] molecule,
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:14.380] in
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:14.480] the
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:14.700] Earth's
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.000] atmosphere.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.680] Note
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.660] the
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.080] sensitivity
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:17.360] of
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:17.460] the

[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:17.900] eye
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:18.380] in
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:18.640] black
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:18.880] right
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:19.120] here,
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:19.440] and
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.600] how
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:19.800] well
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.080] matched
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.240] it
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:20.440] is
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:20.600] to
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:20.740] the
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:20.860] air
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.080] mass
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:21.640] 1
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.700].5
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.040] spectrum.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:23.700] That's
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:23.880] pretty
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.120] cool.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:25.500] That's
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:25.640] pretty
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.000] cool.
[00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:26.870] OK,
[00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.450] so
[00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:28.270] there
[00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:28.390] you
[00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:28.670] have
[00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:29.050] the
[00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:29.590] spectrum.
[00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:30.370] Let's
[00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:30.490] get
[00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:30.610] to
[00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:30.830] these
[00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:31.230] units
[00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.810] of
[00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:32.830] power
[00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:33.250] density
[00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:33.870] per
[00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:34.210] bandwidth
[00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:34.530] for
[00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:34.690] a
[00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:34.870] second.
[00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:35.610] The
[00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:35.750] way
[00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.870] to
[00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:36.050] think
[00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:36.310] about
[00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.550] those
[00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:36.850] units
[00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:37.050] is
[00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:37.210] as
[00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:37.570] follows.
[00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.510] Kilowatts
[00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:38.670] per
[00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:38.830] meter
[00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:39.110] squared,
[00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:39.350] OK,
[00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.490] I
[00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:39.570] get
[00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:39.850] that.
[00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:40.250] It's
[00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.350] the
[00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.490] amount
[00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.590] of
[00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.830] power
[00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:41.650] falling
[00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:41.830] on
[00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:42.070] a
[00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.330] unit
[00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:42.710] area.
[00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.430] Per
[00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:44.050] micron,
[00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:45.110] the
[00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.350] reason
[00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.510] it's
[00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:45.770] normalized
[00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:46.010] per
[00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:46.230] micron
[00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.430] is
[00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.690] because
[00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:46.950] the
[00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:47.250] wavelength
[00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:47.790] units
[00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.010] right
[00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:48.190] here
[00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.330] is
[00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:48.450] in
[00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:48.770] microns.
[00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.910] And
[00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:49.010] if
[00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:49.110] you
[00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.270] take
[00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:49.410] the
[00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:49.670] product
[00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:49.810] of
[00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:49.930] the
[00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:50.150] two,
[00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.610] it
[00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:50.770] makes
[00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:50.890] it
[00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:51.050] pretty
[00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:51.290] easy
[00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:51.450] to
[00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:51.730] calculate
[00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:51.950] the
[00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:52.170] total
[00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:52.410] power
[00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:52.770] density,
[00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.190] right?
[00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:53.330] So
[00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.430] if
[00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.510] you
[00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:53.630] want
[00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.730] to
[00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:54.050] calculate
[00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:54.250] the

[00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:55.330] density,
[00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.710] the

[00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:56.970] watts
[00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:57.170] per

[00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:57.670] meter
[00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:58.370] falling
[00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:58.930] on
[00:33:58.930 --> 00:33:59.090] the
[00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.290] Earth,
[00:33:59.490 --> 00:33:59.610] say
[00:33:59.610 --> 00:33:59.870] between
[00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.130] 0
[00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:00.390].5
[00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:00.490] and
[00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:00.650] 1
[00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:00.930] micron,
[00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:01.590] you
[00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.750] can
[00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:02.150] calculate
[00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:02.490] the
[00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:02.650] total
[00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:02.830] amount
[00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.930] of
[00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.190] power
[00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:03.810] by
[00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:04.190] multiplying
[00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.430] one
[00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.650] versus
[00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:04.850] the
[00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.990] other.
[00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.390] So
[00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:05.550] that's
[00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:05.730] why
[00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:05.870] they're
[00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.950] in
[00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:06.110] this
[00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.350] weird
[00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.610] unit
[00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:06.830] right
[00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:07.110] here.
[00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:07.570] It's
[00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:07.710] to
[00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:07.890] help
[00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:08.150] you
[00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:08.810] perform
[00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:09.330] calculations,
[00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.690] like
[00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:09.810] the
[00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:09.970] ones
[00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:10.090] you'll
[00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:10.170] do
[00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:10.250] in
[00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.330] your

[00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.030] like
[00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.130] the
[00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:11.270] ones
[00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.390] you'll
[00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:11.510] do
[00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.630] for
[00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:11.770] your

[00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.390] project
[00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:12.550] and
[00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.710] so
[00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.950] forth.
[00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:13.670] And
[00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.430] it
[00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.710] strikes
[00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.830] a
[00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:14.930] little

[00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:15.670] odd
[00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:15.850] the

[00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.210] time
[00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:16.310] you
[00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.470] look
[00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.590] at
[00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:16.690] it,
[00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:16.870] but
[00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:17.130] it
[00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:17.470] begins
[00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.730] making
[00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:18.050] sense.
[00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.170] And
[00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:18.290] you're
[00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.630] appreciative
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:18.810] of
[00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:18.870] it
[00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.130] after
[00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:19.290] a
[00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:19.430] while.
[00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.690] There
[00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.910] are
[00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:21.390] standard
[00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:22.150] spectra.
[00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:22.530] There
[00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:22.630] are
[00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:22.890] standard
[00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:23.250] reference
[00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:23.670] spectra.
[00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.190] Sure,
[00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.290] you
[00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.410] can
[00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:24.530] go
[00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:24.930] outside,
[00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.290] and
[00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.070] using
[00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.050] some
[00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.310] form
[00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.490] of
[00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:27.650] a
[00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:28.230] spectrophotometer,
[00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.370] you
[00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:28.490] can
[00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.710] measure
[00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:29.810] the
[00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:30.210] incident
[00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:30.510] solar
[00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.930] radiation
[00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:31.350] and
[00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:31.610] map
[00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:31.850] out
[00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:32.130] the
[00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:32.810] spectral
[00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:33.370] irradiance
[00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:33.790] as
[00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.890] a
[00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:34.090] function
[00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:34.250] of
[00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.550] wavelength.
[00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:35.390] In
[00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:36.210] terms
[00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:36.710] of
[00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:37.370] planning
[00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:37.910] or
[00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.430] communicating
[00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.650] with
[00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:39.870] other
[00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:40.430] scientists,
[00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:40.910] we
[00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:41.550] typically
[00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.950] refer
[00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:42.190] to
[00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.670] standards.
[00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:42.890] We
[00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:43.310] use
[00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.690] common
[00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:44.230] yardsticks,
[00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:44.590] common
[00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:44.990] metrics.
[00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.130] And
[00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:45.250] that
[00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:45.730] facilitates
[00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:46.390] communication,
[00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:47.230] avoids
[00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.750] ambiguity,
[00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.410] avoids
[00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:48.870] misunderstanding.
[00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.670] And
[00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:49.850] so
[00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:50.330] these
[00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:50.910] standards
[00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:51.150] right
[00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:51.350] here,
[00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.570] these
[00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:52.170] ASTMs,
[00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:53.190] refer
[00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.510] to
[00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.790] the

[00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:55.450] that
[00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:55.530] are
[00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:55.730] used
[00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:55.890] for

[00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:00.670] online,
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:01.740] we
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:01.900] go
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.040] into
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:02.300] some
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:02.460] more
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:02.840] detail
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.740] regarding
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.100] that

[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:05.160] are
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:05.420] interested.
[00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:07.010] So
[00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.250] again,
[00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.010] these

[00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:09.790] correspond

[00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:15.390] with
[00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:15.970] some

[00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:17.970] in
[00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:18.490] the

[00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.830] We
[00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:19.990] can
[00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.130] as
[00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:20.290] well
[00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:20.530] have
[00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:20.970] generalized
[00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:21.650] attenuation
[00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.390] due
[00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.530] to
[00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:22.750] other
[00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.210] scattering
[00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.650] mechanisms.
[00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.530] Notice
[00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:25.190] right
[00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.450] here
[00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:25.570] in
[00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:25.670] the
[00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.910] short
[00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:26.290] wavelengths
[00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:26.590] what's
[00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:26.930] happening.
[00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.710] From
[00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.930] the
[00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:29.150] red
[00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.410] to
[00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:29.570] the
[00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:29.870] blue,
[00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:30.910] this
[00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:31.270] light
[00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.390] is
[00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:31.950] particularly
[00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:32.450] affected.
[00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:33.130] We
[00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:33.530] have
[00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:33.990] a
[00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.290] sharp
[00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:34.570] drop
[00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:34.710] in
[00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.810] the
[00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:35.010] shorter
[00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:35.370] wavelengths.
[00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:35.610] And
[00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:36.430] it
[00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.870] grows
[00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:37.430] sharper
[00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.970] the
[00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:38.230] shorter
[00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.370] in
[00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:38.670] wavelength
[00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.910] you
[00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:39.070] go.
[00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.610] So
[00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:39.790] the
[00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:40.490] attenuation,
[00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:41.150] due
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.270] to
[00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.570] passing
[00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:41.770] through
[00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:41.930] the
[00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:42.230] atmosphere,
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:43.820] grows
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.060] or
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:44.540] increases
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:45.480] the
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:45.720] shorter
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:45.880] in
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.180] wavelength
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:46.580] you
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:46.780] go.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:47.520] And
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:47.840] this
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.200] is
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.180] a
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.560] process
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.420] generally
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:50.720] called
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.000] Rayleigh
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.340] scattering.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:52.720] And
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.040] there
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.160] is
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:53.280] a
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:53.580] wavelength
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:53.820] to
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:53.960] the
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.180] fourth
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:54.600] dependence.
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:55.060] So
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:55.220] as
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:55.340] you
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.600] go
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:56.900] shorter
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:57.060] and
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:57.220] shorter
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:57.400] in
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:57.760] wavelength,
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:58.460] the
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.060] likelihood
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:35:59.260] or
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:35:59.600] probability
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:35:59.800] of
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.020] scattering
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:00.180] will
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:00.540] increase.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.000] Why
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.200] is
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:01.360] that
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:01.600] pertinent
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:01.780] to
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:02.060] us?
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:02.520] Well,
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:02.660] now
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:02.780] you
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:02.900] can
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.260] answer
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:03.660] that
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:03.840] little
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.100] child
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:04.260] who
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:04.480] walks
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:04.640] up
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:04.740] to
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:04.840] you
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:04.980] in
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.200] the
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:05.480] shopping
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:05.680] mall
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:05.800] and
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:05.920] says,
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:06.080] why
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:06.200] is
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:06.300] the
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:06.420] sky
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:06.740] blue?
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.000] You
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.180] say,
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:07.440] well,
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:08.400] there
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:08.640] is
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:08.920] this
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.400] elastic
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.100] scattering
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:10.740] mechanism
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.440] of
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:11.940] electromagnetic
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.600] radiation,
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:13.300] whereby
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.160] in
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:14.260] a
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:14.460] broad
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:14.860] spectral
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.260] event,
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:15.520] such
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:15.640] as
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:15.760] the
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:15.960] sun,
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:16.260] black
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:16.480] body
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:16.760] emission,
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:17.460] we
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:17.660] have
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:17.800] the
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.040] shorter
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.420] wavelengths
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:18.640] that
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:18.780] are
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.060] scattered
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:19.480] more.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:19.960] And
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.160] that's
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:20.280] why
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:20.420] when
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:20.520] we
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:20.720] look
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:20.960] away
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.140] from
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:21.320] the
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:21.520] sun
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:21.980] in
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:22.080] the
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:22.220] other
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:22.520] direction,
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.020] we
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:23.200] see
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:23.400] those
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:23.620] shorter
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:23.960] wavelengths
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.180] that
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:24.280] are
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:24.540] scattered
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:24.940] back
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.100] to
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.360] us.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.000] That
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.240] is
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:26.600] pertinent
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:26.800] for
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:26.960] two
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.200] reasons.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:27.560] A,
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:27.700] it
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:27.880] makes
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.020] the
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:28.180] sky
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:28.400] look
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:28.640] blue.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.300] Secondly,
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:29.740] it's
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:29.900] not
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:30.140] only
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:30.540] the
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.300] short
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:31.600] wavelengths
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:31.920] in
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.160] blue
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.380] light
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:32.560] that
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:32.740] we're
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:32.940] worried
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.120] about,
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:33.280] but
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.460] also
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:33.860] the
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.420] ultraviolet
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:34.900] radiation.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:35.780] So
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.100] even
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:36.280] on
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:36.680] a
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:36.960] cloudy
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.220] day,
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:37.440] if
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:37.600] there
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.160] is
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:38.740] a
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.180] few
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.240] open
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:40.620] patches
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:40.840] and
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:40.940] you
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:41.080] can
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:41.360] get
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.140] a
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:42.360] scattered
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:42.620] light
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:42.900] coming
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.080] in,
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:43.360] you
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:43.480] can
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:43.660] still
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:43.840] get
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.140] sunburn.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.060] And
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:45.580] secondly,
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:46.620] there
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:46.780] is
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:46.900] a
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.120] very
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:47.560] strong
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:47.940] dependence
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.420] on
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:48.800] the
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.100] path
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.320] length,
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:49.720] the
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.000] optical
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.340] path
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:50.520] length,
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:50.820] the
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.260] air
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:51.540] mass.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:52.000] So
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.160] if
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:52.260] you
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:52.460] go
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:52.880] further
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.240] north
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:53.400] in
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:53.840] latitudes
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.340] where
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:54.520] your
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:54.700] air
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:54.920] mass
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.440] increases,
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:56.400] because
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:56.760] now
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.360] if
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:57.460] you
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:57.600] think
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:57.860] about
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:58.200] the
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.940] atmosphere
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.120] as
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:36:59.280] being
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:36:59.480] kind
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:36:59.560] of
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:36:59.680] a
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:36:59.940] flat,
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:00.300] just
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:00.620] give
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:00.700] me
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.080] approximation
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:01.460] for
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:01.540] a
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:01.620] minute,
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:02.080] if
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:02.160] you
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:02.320] think
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:02.440] of
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:02.560] the
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:02.720] Earth
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:02.900] being
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.160] flat
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:03.240] and
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:03.320] the
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:03.560] atmosphere
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:03.800] being
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.100] flat,
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:04.680] now
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:04.900] the
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.220] path
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:05.460] length
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:05.620] in
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:05.840] winter
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.060] is
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:06.300] much,
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:06.500] much
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:06.840] greater
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:07.680] than
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:07.860] the

[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:08.240] length
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:08.400] in

[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:09.340] Same
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:09.620] sun,
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:10.380] just
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:10.600] different
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:10.880] path
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.140] length.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:11.720] You're
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.080] much
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.260] more
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:13.480] likely
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:13.620] to

[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.280] in
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:14.520] summer
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.000] than
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.120] you
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:15.260] are
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:15.380] in
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:15.580] winter,
[00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:16.950] because
[00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:17.490] the

[00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:18.010] length

[00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.490] that
[00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:22.550] will
[00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.690] be
[00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:22.910] scattered

[00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.550] is

[00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:23.730] to
[00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:23.830] be
[00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:24.090] less
[00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:24.470] in
[00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.590] the
[00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:24.790] summer
[00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:25.130] than
[00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.250] in
[00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.430] winter.
[00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:26.190] That's
[00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.370] also
[00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:26.550] why
[00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.670] if
[00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.750] you
[00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.930] go
[00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:27.430] south
[00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.570] in
[00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:27.870] latitude,
[00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.130] for
[00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.370] example,
[00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:28.590] from
[00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:28.790] here,
[00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.950] say,
[00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:29.090] to
[00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:29.390] Miami,
[00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:29.990] your
[00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.390] incidence
[00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.590] of
[00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:30.770] getting
[00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:31.090] sunburn
[00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:31.230] is
[00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.330] a
[00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:31.450] lot
[00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:31.770] greater,
[00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:32.290] a
[00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:32.510] lot
[00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.890] more
[00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:33.490] than
[00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:33.990] the
[00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.630] total
[00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.150] increase
[00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.390] of
[00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.530] the
[00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:35.770] visible
[00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:36.110] portion
[00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:36.210] of
[00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:36.310] the
[00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.510] spectrum.
[00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.730] So
[00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:36.870] the
[00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:37.010] sun
[00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:37.150] might
[00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.390] not
[00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.610] look
[00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:37.770] that
[00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:38.010] different
[00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:38.210] to
[00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.390] you,
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:39.980] but
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.420] your
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:40.800] incidence
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.180] of
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:41.560] sunburn
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:41.840] events
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.060] goes
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:42.240] up
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:42.620] quite
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:42.740] a
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:42.820] bit.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:42.940] And
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:43.080] that
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:43.260] is
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:43.580] due
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:43.800] to
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:43.980] Rayleigh
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.360] scattering.
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:45.340] And
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:45.920] now
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.100] by
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:46.280] this
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:46.480] point,
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:46.680] the
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:46.840] little
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.140] child
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:47.360] has
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:47.580] already
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:47.940] run
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.220] crying
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:48.460] back
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:48.600] to
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:48.720] the
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:48.900] parent.
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:49.480] But
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:49.740] you
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.080] have
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:50.480] a
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:50.620] full
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.140] satisfaction
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:51.340] of
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:51.480] knowing
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:51.760] how
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.180] the
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:52.440] universe
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:52.760] around
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:52.940] you
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.320] is
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:53.480] put
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:53.760] together.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:53.900] And
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:54.100] that
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:54.700] actually
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:54.920] was
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.280] a
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:55.560] pretty
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.000] deep
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.500] problem.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:56.720] It
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.060] took
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:57.420] a
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:57.620] long
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:57.940] time
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:58.280] for
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.060] at
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:37:59.200] least
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:37:59.580] European
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.080] scientists
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:00.620] to
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.120] crack
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:01.340] that
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:01.500] nut
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:01.600] and
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:01.800] figure
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:01.940] out
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:02.040] what
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.160] was
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:02.320] going
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:02.560] on.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.280] Describe
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:05.640] how
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:06.020] solar
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:06.440] installation
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:06.720] maps
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:06.920] are
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.220] made
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:07.620] and
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:07.920] use
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.080] them
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:08.280] to
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:08.640] estimate
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:08.840] the

[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:09.380] solar
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:09.820] resource.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:10.460] So
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.000] we
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.540] have
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.360] metrology.
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:12.500] We
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:12.680] have
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.000] techniques
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:13.160] that
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:13.240] we
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:13.380] can
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:13.580] use
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:13.740] to
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.060] measure
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:14.680] the

[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.060] of
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.280] sunlight
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:15.460] that
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:15.560] is
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:15.760] out
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:15.940] there.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:16.620] And
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:16.860] now
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:16.980] we
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.160] want
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:17.280] to
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:17.620] apply
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:17.940] those

[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.040] to
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.420] measure
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:20.640] the
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:20.920] average
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.180] solar

[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.080] around

[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:23.760] including
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.120] the
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:24.420] oceans,
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.080] and
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:25.240] then
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:25.700] use
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.140] that
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:26.660] information
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:26.980] to
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:27.380] estimate
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:27.940] later
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:28.300] on
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.020] the

[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:29.500] area
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:29.800] needed
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:29.980] or
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.180] the

[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:30.680] of
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:30.760] the
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.040] array
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:31.440] or
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:31.600] how
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:31.760] many
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.080] cells
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:32.260] we're
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:32.340] going
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:32.380] to
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:32.480] have
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:32.580] to

[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:33.100] together
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:33.700] based

[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.320] locally.
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:35.520] So
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:35.700] how
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:35.820] are
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.060] these

[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:38.340] that
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:38.480] we'll
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:38.700] use
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:38.860] as

[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:39.800] our
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.100] systems?
[00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:41.130] First
[00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:41.390] off,
[00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.590] let
[00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:41.670] me
[00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:42.110] define
[00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:42.810] insulation.
[00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:43.250] This
[00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.370] is
[00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.570] not
[00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:44.050] insulation,
[00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:44.590] as
[00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:44.710] in
[00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.970] stuff
[00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:45.110] you
[00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:45.270] put
[00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.510] around
[00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.650] the
[00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.810] house
[00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:45.970] to
[00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:46.110] keep
[00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:46.210] the
[00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:46.350] heat
[00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:46.490] from
[00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.670] going
[00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.850] out.
[00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:47.210] This
[00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.370] is
[00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:47.850] insulation
[00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.210] with
[00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:48.350] an
[00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:48.530] O,
[00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:49.270] a
[00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.890] shorthand
[00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:50.150] for
[00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.650] incoming
[00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:50.970] solar
[00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:51.450] radiation,
[00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:52.130] insulation
[00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.430] at
[00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.550] the
[00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.690] top
[00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:52.870] there.
[00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:53.550] It's
[00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.810] typically
[00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:54.090] given
[00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:54.230] in
[00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.470] units
[00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.610] of
[00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:54.950] energy
[00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:55.150] per
[00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.330] unit
[00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:55.630] area
[00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.850] per
[00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:56.050] unit
[00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:56.450] time.
[00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:58.130] So
[00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.550] kilowatt
[00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.810] hours,
[00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.990] that's
[00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.310] energy,
[00:38:59.590 --> 00:38:59.790] per
[00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:00.050] meter
[00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.310] squared
[00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.470] per
[00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.670] day.
[00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:01.510] And
[00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.710] it's
[00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:01.930] helpful
[00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:02.170] when
[00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:02.510] designing
[00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.670] or
[00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.990] projecting
[00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.210] these
[00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:03.370] PV
[00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:03.750] systems.
[00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:04.170] And
[00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:04.310] it's
[00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.590] affected
[00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:04.830] by
[00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.050] a
[00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:05.210] bunch
[00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:05.330] of
[00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:05.590] stuff,
[00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:06.010] which
[00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:06.110] we'll
[00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:06.250] get
[00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:06.450] to
[00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:06.870] over
[00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.970] the
[00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:07.110] next
[00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:07.230] few
[00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.470] slides.
[00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:07.730] So
[00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:08.390] we
[00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.550] can
[00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.970] measure
[00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:09.810] insulation
[00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:10.390] from
[00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.530] the
[00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:10.810] ground.
[00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:11.450] That's
[00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:11.550] a
[00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.890] surefire
[00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:12.070] way
[00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:12.190] to
[00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.310] do
[00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:12.430] it.
[00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:13.850] This
[00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:14.030] right
[00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.290] here
[00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:14.530] is
[00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:14.730] a
[00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:15.330] pyranometer,
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.540] pyro,
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:18.380] fire,
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.460] sun,
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.640] anode
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:21.120] on
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:21.400] top
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:21.600] of.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:22.180] So
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:22.680] anode,
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.220] cathode,
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:24.180] cata,
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:24.620] under,
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:25.320] ana,
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:25.680] above,
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.100] catatonic,
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:27.420] under.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.180] So
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:29.660] pyranometer,
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:29.980] so
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.220] it's
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:30.500] basically
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:30.940] measuring
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:31.220] the
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:31.480] sun
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:31.920] above.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:32.440] It's
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:32.920] measuring
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.300] the
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:33.620] sunlight
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:33.800] above.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.300] This
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:34.420] is
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:34.540] a
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:34.740] full
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.240] hemisphere,
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:36.980] measuring
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:37.560] the
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:37.780] sunlight
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:38.060] coming
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:38.220] in
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:38.340] from
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:38.480] all
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:38.720] angles.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.120] There's
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:39.300] a
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:39.600] small
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:39.800] little
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.100] sensor
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:40.300] right
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:40.420] here.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:40.560] It's
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:40.720] lying
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.060] flat.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:41.620] And
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:41.880] that
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.540] glass
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:42.700] is
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:42.940] essentially
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:43.260] allowing
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:43.400] the
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:43.540] light
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:43.700] from
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:43.920] different
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.120] angles
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:44.280] to
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:44.400] get
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:44.600] in
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.340] to
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:45.500] the
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:45.740] sensor.
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:46.400] And
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:46.560] this
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:46.720] is
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.020] a
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:47.380] very
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.180] narrow,
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:48.620] solid
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:48.900] angle
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:49.040] of
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:49.120] the
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.360] sky.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:49.600] It's
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:49.820] probably
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.040] just
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:50.340] looking
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:50.540] at
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:50.740] the
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:51.040] sun,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:51.540] or
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:51.780] in
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:51.900] a
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.140] particular
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:52.600] direction,
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:52.900] rather,
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:53.440] plus
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:53.580] or
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:53.820] minus
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.000] 2
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.100] and
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.180] 1
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:54.260] half
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:54.660] degrees
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.060] in
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:55.300] either
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:55.980] direction.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:56.520] So
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:56.620] it's
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:56.720] a
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:56.860] very
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.180] limited,
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:57.780] solid
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.020] angle
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:58.140] of
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:58.240] the
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:58.500] sky.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.120] This
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:00.280] one
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:00.440] over
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:00.800] here
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.080] would
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:01.200] be
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:01.380] more
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:01.740] appropriate,
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:01.940] say,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.100] for
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:02.220] a
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:02.400] flat
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:02.720] panel
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:03.360] that's
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:03.680] receiving
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.080] scattered
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:04.340] light
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:04.580] coming
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:04.700] in
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:04.800] at
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:04.980] all
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.260] angles.
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.160] This
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:06.300] one
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:06.480] over
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:06.840] here
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.080] would
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:07.220] be
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:07.380] more
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:07.720] appropriate
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.120] for
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:08.340] a
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:08.600] tracking
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.040] system,
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:09.840] especially
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.060] a
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.580] concentrator
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:10.980] system
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:11.480] that
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:11.680] has
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.040] optics
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:12.340] that
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:12.620] only
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.000] accept
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:13.240] light
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:13.380] in
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:13.560] from
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:13.680] a
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:13.820] very
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:14.060] limited
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:14.320] solid
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:14.600] angle.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:15.200] So
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:15.340] imagine
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:15.440] you
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:15.520] have
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:15.660] a
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:15.940] lens
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:16.240] that
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.440] has
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:16.520] to
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:16.660] have
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:16.860] light
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.200] incident
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:17.480] to
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:17.640] it
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.000] to
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:18.260] focus
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:18.380] it
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:18.480] on
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:18.560] the
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:18.680] right
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.020] spot.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:19.720] If
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:19.880] the
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.000] sun
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.280] moves
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:20.380] in
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:20.460] the
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:20.580] wrong
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:20.980] spot,
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:21.160] or
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:21.920] put
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.020] it
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.260] another
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:22.400] way,
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:22.520] if
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:22.620] the
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:22.840] lens
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.000] is
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:23.340] in
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:23.440] the
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:23.600] wrong
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:23.980] position
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.280] relative
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:24.500] to
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:24.620] the
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:24.900] incident
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:25.300] solar
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:25.740] radiation,
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:26.400] the
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:26.540] light
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:26.640] is
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:26.780] being
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.120] focused
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:27.500] off
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:27.600] of
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:27.720] the
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:27.900] solar
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:28.140] cell.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:28.760] And
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:28.880] it
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.120] doesn't
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:29.420] produce
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:29.580] any
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:29.780] power.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:30.460] So
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:30.720] this
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.040] is
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:31.520] a
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:31.780] system
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.060] that's
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:32.400] used
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.340] for
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.020] measuring
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.260] the
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:35.600] direct
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:35.980] solar
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.380] spectrum,
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:36.700] which
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:36.800] will
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:36.980] be
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:37.320] useful
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:37.740] for
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.220] calculating
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:38.420] the
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:38.580] total
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:38.920] output
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.220] from
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:39.860] concentrator
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.240] systems.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.080] And
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.240] this
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:41.780] pyranometer
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:42.020] over
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:42.260] here
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:42.580] is
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:42.920] useful
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.320] for
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:43.700] flat
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:43.980] panel
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.580] systems.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:45.300] And
[00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.730] we
[00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:47.930] can
[00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:48.170] also
[00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:48.590] measure
[00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:49.010] the
[00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.390] total
[00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.670] amount
[00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.830] of
[00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:50.110] incident
[00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:50.430] solar
[00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.830] radiation,
[00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:51.190] total
[00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.350] amount
[00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:51.430] of
[00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.690] insulation,
[00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:52.050] from
[00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:52.210] the
[00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:52.470] sky
[00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:53.070] using
[00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:53.490] satellite
[00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:53.870] imagery.
[00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.890] This
[00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:55.030] is
[00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.150] an
[00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.510] example
[00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:56.050] of
[00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:56.430] a
[00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.710] measurement.
[00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.770] And
[00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.930] this
[00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:58.090] right
[00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:58.330] here
[00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:58.570] is
[00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.470] average
[00:40:59.470 --> 00:40:59.850] insulation
[00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:00.630] from

[00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.990] watts
[00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.170] per

[00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:02.590] meter,
[00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:04.350] taken
[00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:04.810] from
[00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:05.110] a
[00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:05.290] NASA

[00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:06.550] with
[00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.750] the

[00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:08.150] Observatory.
[00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.790] Very
[00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:09.030] cool
[00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.370] website,
[00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.710] great
[00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.950] place
[00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:10.070] to
[00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:10.250] spend
[00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.350] a

[00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.750] night
[00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:11.150] if
[00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.710] you
[00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.830] don't
[00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:11.950] have
[00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:12.230] plans.
[00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.570] Just
[00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.130] log
[00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.290] on
[00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:13.550] here
[00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.930] and
[00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:14.470] bunches
[00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.610] of

[00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:15.130] from
[00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:15.690] snow
[00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:15.970] cover
[00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:16.150] to
[00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.590] population
[00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:16.990] density
[00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.310] to
[00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:18.010] CO2
[00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:18.250] being
[00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:18.490] emitted
[00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:18.830] to

[00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:19.830] around
[00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:19.950] the
[00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:20.170] planet.
[00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:20.730] Anything
[00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:20.910] that
[00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:21.030] a
[00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.250] satellite
[00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:21.510] can
[00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.770] measure,
[00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:21.970] they're
[00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:22.210] measuring.
[00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.970] And
[00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:23.670] the
[00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:24.110] insulation
[00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:24.530] value
[00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:24.690] is
[00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:24.870] one
[00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.950] of
[00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:25.090] them.
[00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:26.210] And
[00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:26.370] so
[00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:26.510] we
[00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.850] have
[00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:27.370] data
[00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:27.770] from
[00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:28.990] various
[00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.470] points.
[00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:30.090] This
[00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:30.290] is
[00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.550] the
[00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.030] insulation
[00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.370] in
[00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.790] January.
[00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.730] So
[00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:32.930] in
[00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:33.350] January,
[00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.590] it's
[00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:34.870] the
[00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:35.190] Southern
[00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.990] Hemisphere's
[00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.410] summer,
[00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:37.130] the
[00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.330] Northern
[00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:37.910] Hemisphere's
[00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:38.150] winter.
[00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:39.010] And
[00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:39.290] as
[00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.410] a
[00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.730] result,
[00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:40.030] we
[00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.310] have
[00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.890] less
[00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:41.650] insulation
[00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:42.050] up
[00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.370] north.
[00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:42.690] We're
[00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:42.830] in
[00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:43.070] the
[00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:43.610] blues.
[00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:44.130] And
[00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:44.250] the
[00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:44.470] Southern
[00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.870] Hemisphere
[00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:45.030] is
[00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.210] more
[00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:45.310] in
[00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:45.410] the
[00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.730] reds.
[00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.990] And
[00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.290] of
[00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:47.510] course,
[00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:47.870] the
[00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:48.050] tide
[00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.390] turns
[00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.630] in
[00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.930] July.
[00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:50.890] We
[00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:51.270] have
[00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.590] our
[00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:52.010] summer.
[00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.450] And
[00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:52.630] the
[00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.830] Southern
[00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:53.190] Hemisphere
[00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.490] has
[00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:53.730] their
[00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.290] winter.
[00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:54.490] And
[00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:54.610] the
[00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:54.770] poor
[00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:55.090] folks
[00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:55.210] here
[00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:55.310] in
[00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.590] Antarctica
[00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:55.830] have
[00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:56.070] nothing.
[00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.030] So
[00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.690] a
[00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:57.850] couple
[00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:58.010] of
[00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.190] things
[00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.410] to
[00:41:58.410 --> 00:41:58.710] note.
[00:41:58.850 --> 00:41:59.190] Just
[00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.530] already,
[00:41:59.690 --> 00:41:59.810] straight
[00:41:59.810 --> 00:41:59.990] off
[00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.110] the
[00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:00.390] bat,
[00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:01.110] we're
[00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:01.410] noticing
[00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:01.810] that
[00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:02.270] there's,
[00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:03.110] in
[00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:03.410] general,
[00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:03.930] higher
[00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:04.750] insulation
[00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:05.250] near
[00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:05.430] the
[00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.690] equator,
[00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:06.330] the
[00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:06.530] equator
[00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.970] passing
[00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:07.250] right
[00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.430] through
[00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:08.390] here,
[00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.670] approximately.
[00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:10.710] Fun
[00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:11.130] fact,
[00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.510] small
[00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.750] city
[00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.910] up
[00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:12.010] there
[00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:12.090] in
[00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:12.150] the

[00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.390] of
[00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.610] Brazil,
[00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.970] there's
[00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:13.110] a
[00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:13.310] soccer
[00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.650] field
[00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:13.890] that
[00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:14.010] is
[00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:14.210] half
[00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.310] in
[00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:14.410] the
[00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:14.550] north
[00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.690] and
[00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.850] half
[00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:14.950] in
[00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:15.030] the
[00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.190] south.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:16.560] That's
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:16.740] neither
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:16.880] here
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:16.960] nor
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.100] there.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:17.540] We
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:17.880] have
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.000] rainforests
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.120] up
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.260] here
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:19.400] in
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:19.540] the
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:19.740] north
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:19.880] of
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.180] Brazil,
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.060] Central
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:21.420] Africa,
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:21.960] and
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:22.280] here
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:22.420] in
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:22.700] Southeast
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.080] Asia.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:23.680] And
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:23.900] even
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:24.080] when
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:24.220] the
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:24.360] sun
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:24.500] is
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:24.760] directly
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.180] overhead,
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:25.480] those
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:25.800] clouds
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:25.980] are
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:26.260] preventing
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:26.520] some
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:26.600] of
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:26.660] the
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.440] sunlight
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:27.740] from
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:27.920] getting
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.160] in.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:28.600] And
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:28.860] that's
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.140] why,
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:29.640] right
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:29.740] at
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:29.860] the
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:30.100] equator
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:30.640] itself,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.160] we
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:31.440] typically
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:31.700] have
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:31.960] less
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.440] insulation
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.000] than
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.120] we
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:33.420] do
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:33.820] in
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:33.940] the
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:34.360] tropics,
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:34.580] say,

[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:42.480] just
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:42.660] to
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:42.980] situate
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:43.260] yourselves.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:43.800] And
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:43.920] the
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.280] tropics
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:44.440] are
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:44.660] how
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:44.860] far
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:45.020] away
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:45.140] from
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:45.240] the
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:45.420] equator?
[00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:47.150] All
[00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.250] right,
[00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:47.510] OK,
[00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:47.930] 23
[00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:48.070] and
[00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:48.170] 1
[00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.250] half.
[00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:48.490] Good
[00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:48.730] guess.
[00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:50.590] Good.
[00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.450] So
[00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:53.070] what
[00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:53.290] we're
[00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:53.450] going
[00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.610] to
[00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:53.890] do
[00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:54.270] is
[00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:54.590] now
[00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:54.950] launch
[00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:55.090] into
[00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:55.230] our

[00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.570] learning
[00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:55.950] objective,
[00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.170] which
[00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:56.310] is
[00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:56.490] to
[00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:56.710] list
[00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.910] the
[00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:57.310] causes
[00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:57.990] of
[00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.450] variation
[00:42:58.450 --> 00:42:58.770] and
[00:42:58.770 --> 00:42:59.450] intermittency
[00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:00.410] of
[00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:00.570] the

[00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:01.170] resource
[00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:01.450] and
[00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:01.830] quantify
[00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:02.030] the
[00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.230] time
[00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.550] constants
[00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:02.770] and
[00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:03.110] magnitudes.
[00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:03.690] This
[00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:03.890] is
[00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:04.350] really,
[00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.950] really,
[00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:05.290] really,
[00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:05.610] really
[00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.170] important.
[00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:07.370] The
[00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.510] other
[00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.790] stuff
[00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.930] is
[00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:08.110] very
[00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:08.350] useful

[00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.910] It's
[00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:31.050] going

[00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:41.930] the

[00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:43.490] is
[00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.710] that
[00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:44.050] it's
[00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:44.710] unpredictable
[00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:45.450] in

[00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.510] So
[00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.910] we've
[00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:49.090] talked
[00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:49.250] a

[00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.590] so
[00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:50.870] far
[00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:51.290] and
[00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.450] about

[00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:52.750] We've
[00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:52.910] talked
[00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:53.150] about
[00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.610] how
[00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:53.950] the

[00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.370] varies

[00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.530] summer
[00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:56.750] to
[00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.930] winter.
[00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.350] We've
[00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:57.530] talked
[00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:57.730] about
[00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:58.010] how
[00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:58.630] the

[00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.630] varies
[00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.830] as

[00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:03.750] But
[00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:04.710] now
[00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.670] we're
[00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.810] going
[00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:05.950] to

[00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:24.550] you're

[00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.870] And
[00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.990] that's

[00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.470] it
[00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.650] looks
[00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:40.870] a
[00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.950] little
[00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:41.090] bit
[00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:41.370] like

[00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:44.250] And
[00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:44.470] indeed
[00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.610] it
[00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:44.890] does.
[00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.350] You

[00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.310] You
[00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:56.450] can
[00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:56.670] vary
[00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.870] the

[00:44:58.890 --> 00:44:59.010] for
[00:44:59.010 --> 00:44:59.290] instance.
[00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.230] And
[00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.650] you
[00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:00.770] can
[00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:01.010] see
[00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.310] how
[00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:02.090] the
[00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:02.270] solar
[00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.770] resource,
[00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:03.570] this
[00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:03.750] is
[00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.050] the
[00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:04.950] direct
[00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:05.450] radiation,
[00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:06.150] kilowatts
[00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.310] per
[00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:06.470] meter
[00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.850] squared.
[00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:07.830] And
[00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:07.970] this
[00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:08.090] is
[00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:08.230] the
[00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.630] time.
[00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:09.070] So
[00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:09.170] if
[00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.250] you
[00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:09.390] take
[00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.570] the
[00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:09.850] integral
[00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:10.470] of
[00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.810] the
[00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:11.090] curve
[00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:11.330] right
[00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:11.610] here,
[00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:12.050] you're
[00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.130] going
[00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:12.230] to
[00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.350] get
[00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:12.570] what?
[00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:13.030] Units
[00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.270] of?
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.280] Power
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:17.760] times
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.100] time
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:18.400] is?
[00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.870] Energy.
[00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:20.570] Energy
[00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:20.870] per
[00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:21.350] unit
[00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:21.650] area.
[00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:22.110] So
[00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:22.490] you're
[00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.550] going
[00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.610] to
[00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:22.650] be
[00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:22.750] able
[00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.850] to
[00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:23.070] calculate
[00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:23.250] the
[00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:23.430] total
[00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.590] amount
[00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:23.670] of
[00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.890] energy
[00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:24.230] falling
[00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.410] on
[00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:24.530] a
[00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:24.670] given
[00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:25.090] area
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.480] per
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.000] day,
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:27.360] let's
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:27.500] say.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:28.500] So
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:28.980] if
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.360] we
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:29.680] look
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:29.980] at
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:30.260] the
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:30.520] size
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:30.620] of
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:30.740] this
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:30.920] little
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.240] curve
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:31.520] in
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:31.760] winter,
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:32.940] the
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:33.260] total
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:33.640] area
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:33.800] under
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.040] this
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:34.200] is
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:34.360] going
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:34.440] to
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:34.500] be
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:34.680] very
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:35.000] small.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:35.360] That's
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:35.580] because
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:35.780] the
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:35.940] solar
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:36.300] resource
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:36.480] is
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:36.640] very
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:36.940] small.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:37.660] And
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:37.960] the
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:38.220] sun
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.060] rises
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:39.500] late
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:39.940] and
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:40.120] sets
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:40.420] early
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:40.700] in
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:40.900] winter.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.280] And
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:42.540] as
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:42.660] we
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:42.840] move
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.120] towards
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:43.520] summer,
[00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:45.610] obviously
[00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:45.790] the
[00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:46.090] total
[00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:46.410] amount
[00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:46.530] of
[00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:46.650] the
[00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:46.830] solar
[00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:47.170] resource
[00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:47.730] increases.
[00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:48.670] Not
[00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.870] only
[00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:49.410] it
[00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:49.830] increases
[00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:50.290] because
[00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:50.590] of
[00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:50.930] this,
[00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.350] that
[00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:51.450] we
[00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:51.690] have
[00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:51.910] at
[00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:52.190] solar
[00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.530] noon,
[00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:53.690] we
[00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.870] have
[00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:54.350] less
[00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:54.630] of
[00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:55.150] a

[00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:55.550] through
[00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.710] the
[00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:55.990] atmosphere.
[00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:56.150] We
[00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.290] have
[00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:56.490] more
[00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:56.890] sunlight
[00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:57.530] reaching
[00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:57.690] the
[00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:57.810] Earth.
[00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:58.230] We
[00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.410] have
[00:45:58.410 --> 00:45:58.510] a
[00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:58.810] total
[00:45:58.810 --> 00:45:59.570] increase
[00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:00.090] of
[00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:00.930] the

[00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:02.310] reaching
[00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:02.450] the

[00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:02.670] We
[00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.890] also
[00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:03.270] have
[00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.530] that

[00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.530] term
[00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:04.910] here
[00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.570] dictating
[00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.090] the

[00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:08.830]-section
[00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:09.290] incident
[00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.730] to
[00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:09.870] that
[00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:10.170] sunlight
[00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:10.450] coming
[00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:10.750] in,
[00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:11.750] increasing.
[00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:12.230] And
[00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.370] so
[00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:12.590] that's
[00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:12.910] driving
[00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:13.110] this
[00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:13.330] going
[00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:13.630] up.
[00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:14.110] And
[00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:14.230] we
[00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.470] also
[00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:15.010] have
[00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:15.430] a
[00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.670] second
[00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:16.050] fact
[00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:16.430] that
[00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.950] the
[00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:17.370] time
[00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:17.490] of
[00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:17.610] the
[00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:17.770] day,
[00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:17.950] the
[00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:18.130] total
[00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:18.490] duration
[00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:18.650] of
[00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.730] the

[00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:19.370] increases,
[00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.610] at
[00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:19.730] least
[00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:19.870] in
[00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:20.070] northern
[00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:20.530] latitudes.
[00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:21.230] And
[00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.630] here
[00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:21.830] at
[00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:22.130] around
[00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.510] 40,
[00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:22.890] let's
[00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:23.030] say
[00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.750] 41
[00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:24.030] degrees
[00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.290] north
[00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:24.730] here
[00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:24.850] in
[00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:25.070] Boston.
[00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:25.790] And
[00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:26.910] we
[00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:27.210] have,
[00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:28.110] because
[00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:28.250] of
[00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.370] these
[00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.530] two
[00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:28.870] effects,
[00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:29.250] a
[00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:29.450] much
[00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:30.410] larger
[00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.810] area
[00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:31.130] underneath
[00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.070] that
[00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:32.550] curve.
[00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:33.270] And
[00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.350] so
[00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:33.430] as
[00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.530] we
[00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:33.650] go
[00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:33.830] through
[00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:34.110] summer,
[00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:34.610] and
[00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:34.790] now
[00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:35.130] finally
[00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:35.530] to
[00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:36.450] September
[00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:36.870] 13,
[00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:38.110] and
[00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:38.270] back
[00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.410] to
[00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:38.650] winter,
[00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.230] our
[00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.370] solar
[00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:39.670] resource
[00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.870] goes
[00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:40.070] back
[00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:40.250] down
[00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.410] again.
[00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:40.710] So
[00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.810] you
[00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:40.930] can
[00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:41.310] calculate
[00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:41.450] it.
[00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.550] You
[00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:41.690] can
[00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:41.990] visualize
[00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.290] it.
[00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:43.290] That's
[00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:43.790] cool.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:46.100] And
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:46.300] we
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:46.640] can
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.380] plot
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:48.140] the
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.400] total
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:48.720] amount
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.060] of
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:49.500] energy
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:49.840] per
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.180] unit
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:50.560] area
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:50.760] per
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:51.020] day,
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:51.420] essentially
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:51.600] the
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:51.820] integral
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:52.040] under
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:52.240] that
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:52.560] curve,
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.100] as
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:53.240] a
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:53.480] function
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:53.680] of
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.320] location
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:54.820] around
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:54.960] the
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.160] US,
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:55.380] around
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:55.520] the
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:55.780] world,
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.480] per
[00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.790] month,
[00:46:57.850 --> 00:46:58.050] let's
[00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:58.190] say.
[00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.630] So
[00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.770] this
[00:46:58.770 --> 00:46:58.910] is
[00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:59.250] January.
[00:46:59.730 --> 00:46:59.950] This
[00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:00.130] is
[00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:00.470] kilowatt
[00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.690] hours
[00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:00.890] per
[00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:01.030] meter
[00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.250] squared
[00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.410] per
[00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:01.590] day.
[00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:01.870] So
[00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.970] it's
[00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:02.110] just
[00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:02.350] taking
[00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:02.510] the
[00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.730] integral
[00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:03.610] of
[00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:04.150] the
[00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.490] curves
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.580] measured.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:07.800] So
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:07.940] it's
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:08.200] accounting
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:08.440] for
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:08.680] cloudy
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.020] days,
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:09.560] which
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:09.840] kind
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:09.980] of
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:10.480] has
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:10.680] a
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.180] depressive
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:11.460] effect.
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:11.660] This
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:11.760] is
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:11.860] an
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:12.160] envelope
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:12.560] function,
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:12.700] if
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:12.800] you
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:12.960] will,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:13.160] the
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:13.480] maximum
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:13.620] you
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:13.740] could
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:13.980] get.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:14.480] And
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:14.600] then,
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:14.720] of
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:14.880] course,
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:15.180] local
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:15.400] weather
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:15.700] patterns
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:15.860] will
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:16.240] suppress
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:16.480] that,
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:16.720] drive
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:16.820] it
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:17.020] down.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:17.720] So
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:17.920] this
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.160] is
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.520] the
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:19.900] real
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:20.160] map
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:20.260] of
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:20.360] the
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:20.560] United
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.000] States.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.300] And
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:21.420] you
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:21.560] can
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:21.860] see,
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.580] in
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.000] sunnier
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:23.340] areas
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:23.480] that
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:23.560] are
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:23.740] less
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.120] cloudy,
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:24.580] over
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:24.800] here,
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:24.980] for
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.240] example,
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:25.620] in
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:25.980] Arizona
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.120] and
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:26.220] New
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:26.540] Mexico,
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.340] there's
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:27.460] a
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:27.680] large
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:27.880] solar
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:28.240] resource
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:28.460] even
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:28.600] in
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.000] January.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.260] Atlanta,
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:30.780] which
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:30.940] has
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:31.300] half
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:31.420] of
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:31.540] the
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:31.760] number
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.120] of
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:32.340] sunny
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:32.600] days
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:32.820] per
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.080] year
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:33.620] as
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:33.920] Phoenix
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.320] does,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.260] even
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:35.400] if
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:35.520] it's
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:35.640] at
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:35.760] the
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:35.980] same
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.360] latitude,
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:37.280] is
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:37.460] getting
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:37.620] about
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:37.840] half
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:37.940] the
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:38.120] solar
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:38.500] resource.
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:39.580] They
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:39.700] got
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:39.880] a
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.160] short
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:40.300] end
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:40.380] of
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:40.500] the
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:40.660] stick.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:40.980] Again,
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:41.600] this
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.200] curve
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:42.400] right
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:42.680] here
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:42.980] is
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:43.340] the
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:43.880] envelope
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.260] function.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:44.880] And
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:45.260] off
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:45.360] of
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:45.560] that,
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:46.340] you
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:46.480] can
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:46.900] only
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:47.040] go
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.280] down.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:48.340] You
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:48.460] can
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:48.620] only
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:48.940] decrease
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:49.080] the
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:49.220] amount
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:49.340] of
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:49.500] solar
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:49.920] resource
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:50.300] actually
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:50.720] arriving
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.440] at
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:51.560] our
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.040] feet
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:52.280] here.
[00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.290] And
[00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:53.390] so
[00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.550] this
[00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:53.670] is
[00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.810] in
[00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:54.110] January.
[00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:54.730] And
[00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:55.190] this
[00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.310] is
[00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:55.550] all
[00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:55.650] in
[00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:55.730] the
[00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.910] same
[00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:56.190] color
[00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.490] scale
[00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:56.810] here
[00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:57.430] as
[00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.550] we
[00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:57.750] move
[00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.910] through
[00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:58.030] the
[00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.250] months.
[00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:58.570] So
[00:47:58.570 --> 00:47:58.730] we'll
[00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:58.930] move
[00:47:58.930 --> 00:47:59.110] from
[00:47:59.110 --> 00:47:59.470] January
[00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:00.370] to
[00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:00.730] February
[00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:01.250] to
[00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:01.590] March,
[00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.450] April,
[00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:03.070] May,
[00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.930] June,
[00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:04.650] July,
[00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.530] August,
[00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:06.170] September,
[00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:06.890] October,
[00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.590] November,
[00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:08.430] December.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:10.380] So
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:10.500] you
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:10.620] can
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:11.020] see,
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:11.540] across
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:11.700] the

[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:12.280] States,
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:12.600] how
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:12.740] the
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:13.060] resource
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:13.260] is
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:13.660] distributed
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:14.380] geographically.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.000] The
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:15.300] general
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:15.640] trend
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:15.800] that
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:15.920] as
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:16.020] you
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:16.160] go
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:16.420] from
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:16.740] south
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:16.920] to
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.260] north,
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:17.700] you
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:17.820] have
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:17.940] a
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.360] decreasing
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:18.680] solar
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.100] resource
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:19.560] holds.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:20.020] You
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:20.160] can
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:20.360] also
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:20.540] see
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:20.660] the
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:20.960] influence
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:21.100] of
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:21.320] local

[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:21.900] patterns
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:22.140] as
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:22.320] well
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:22.540] for
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:22.680] the
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:22.860] same
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.200] latitude.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:25.400] So
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:25.540] that's
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:25.720] pretty
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:25.900] nifty.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:26.720] And
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.240] another

[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:28.220] if
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:28.320] you
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:28.500] look
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:28.640] at
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:28.800] the

[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:29.420] average

[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:30.240] annual,
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:30.560] this
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:30.640] is
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:30.720] the
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:30.900] annual
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:31.180] average
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:31.500] value.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:32.300] Here
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:32.460] in
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:32.780] Boston,
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.020] we're
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:33.300] averaging
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:33.540] around

[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:35.720] squared
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:35.880] per

[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.140] Phoenix,
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:37.660] Arizona
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:37.980] can

[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:40.740] the
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:41.400] outskirts.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.200] It's
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:42.360] not
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:42.560] that
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:42.800] bad.
[00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:44.490] It's
[00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:44.770] only

[00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.030] It's

[00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:47.970] I
[00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:48.110] tell
[00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:48.490] myself.
[00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:48.790] I
[00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.970] don't
[00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:50.130] believe
[00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:50.230] it
[00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.430] myself
[00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.770] either.
[00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:50.890] I
[00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:51.410] try
[00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:51.550] to
[00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:51.790] convince
[00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:52.130] myself
[00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.250] of
[00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.330] that
[00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:52.510] during
[00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.730] winter.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:53.720] All
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:53.840] right,
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.160] let
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:54.280] me
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:54.540] show
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:54.800] you
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:55.200] the
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:55.900] seasonal
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:56.160] and
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:56.480] diurnal
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.040] variations
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:57.740] from
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:58.740] where
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:48:58.960] we're
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.360] increasing
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:48:59.540] the
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:48:59.720] level
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:48:59.860] of
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:00.520] sophistication
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:00.700] as
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:00.820] we
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:00.940] go
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:01.220] along.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:01.840] We've
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:02.100] assumed
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:02.260] you've
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:02.380] done
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:02.500] your
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:02.740] readings.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:03.520] We've
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:03.740] started
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:03.920] with
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.080] some
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:04.360] simple
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:04.760] examples.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.100] And
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:05.280] now
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:05.420] we're
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:05.680] really
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.040] taking
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:06.220] it
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:06.620] one
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:06.820] step
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:07.140] further,
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:07.360] which
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:07.500] is
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:07.580] to
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:07.880] introduce
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.040] the
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:08.220] full
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:08.480] 3D
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:08.740] model.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:09.440] And
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:09.540] I'm
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:09.620] going
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:09.780] to
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:09.960] do
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.260] that
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:10.600] by
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:10.880] use
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.140] of
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:11.360] this
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:11.680] really
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.180] cool
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:13.500] app
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:13.740] that's
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:14.100] available
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.220] here,
[00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:17.110] right
[00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:17.330] here.
[00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:18.210] This
[00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:18.690] is
[00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:19.190] you
[00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.910] standing
[00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:20.110] on
[00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:20.230] the
[00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.450] Earth.
[00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:21.070] And
[00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:21.190] you
[00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.410] can
[00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:22.070] drag
[00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:22.250] and
[00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.390] pull
[00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.530] this
[00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:22.750] around.
[00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.890] You
[00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:23.010] can
[00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:23.130] see
[00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:23.290] this
[00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:23.550] north,
[00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.830] south,
[00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:24.090] east,
[00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:24.230] and
[00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.470] west.
[00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.270] So
[00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.370] I'm
[00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:25.450] going
[00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:25.550] to
[00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.690] pull
[00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:25.810] it
[00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:25.930] up
[00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:26.110] a
[00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:26.230] little
[00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.470] bit
[00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.710] just
[00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.870] to
[00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:27.310] give
[00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:27.410] us
[00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.530] a
[00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.630] little
[00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.770] bit
[00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.870] of
[00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:28.310] perspective.
[00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:29.130] Still,
[00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:29.470] south
[00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.650] is
[00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:29.930] facing
[00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:30.230] toward
[00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.450] us.
[00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.670] North
[00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.830] is
[00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:31.150] away.
[00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.750] The
[00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.890] sun
[00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:32.070] will
[00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:32.370] rise
[00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:32.470] in
[00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.550] the
[00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:32.770] east
[00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:32.930] and
[00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:33.110] set
[00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:33.230] in
[00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.350] the
[00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:33.590] west.
[00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.430] Now,
[00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.830] let's
[00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:36.030] say
[00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:36.230] I
[00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.630] pull
[00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.910] the
[00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:37.530] date
[00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:38.190] back
[00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.790] to
[00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:40.670] September.
[00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.690] So
[00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:42.130] this
[00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:42.570] little
[00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:42.990] tool
[00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.210] is
[00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:43.390] so
[00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.690] cool
[00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:43.990] because
[00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.250] it
[00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:44.810] recognizes
[00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:45.070] your
[00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:45.270] IP
[00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.630] address
[00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.830] and
[00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:46.250] situates
[00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.370] you
[00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:46.450] at
[00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:46.550] the
[00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.770] proper
[00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:47.110] latitude.
[00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:47.870] So
[00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:48.190] we
[00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.310] don't
[00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:48.450] have
[00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:48.550] to
[00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:48.730] touch
[00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:48.930] that
[00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:49.050] at
[00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:49.170] all.
[00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:49.630] It's
[00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:50.030] approximately
[00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.310] right.
[00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:50.470] We're
[00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.610] at
[00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:51.330] about
[00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:51.670] 41
[00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:52.030] degrees.
[00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:53.050] We're
[00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:53.230] right
[00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:53.370] here
[00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:53.510] in
[00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.870] September.
[00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.810] And
[00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:55.110] in
[00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:55.330] terms
[00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:55.490] of
[00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.690] time
[00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:55.830] of
[00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:56.150] day,
[00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:56.510] we
[00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.630] can
[00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.810] pretty
[00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:56.990] much
[00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.210] just
[00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:57.530] cycle
[00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.790] through
[00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:57.950] the
[00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:58.110] time
[00:49:58.110 --> 00:49:58.210] of
[00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:58.350] day
[00:49:58.350 --> 00:49:58.470] if
[00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.570] we
[00:49:58.570 --> 00:49:58.870] like.
[00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:00.210] We
[00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:00.450] could,
[00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.910] for
[00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:01.210] example,
[00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:02.690] start
[00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:03.150] animation.
[00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:04.070] Let's
[00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:04.150] see,
[00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:04.350] this
[00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:04.670] is
[00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:05.210] going
[00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:05.590] very
[00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:05.930] fast
[00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:06.130] right
[00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:06.370] now.
[00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.850] I'm
[00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:06.930] going
[00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:07.050] to
[00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:07.210] slow
[00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:07.330] it
[00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:07.610] down.
[00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.430] So
[00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.730] you
[00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:08.830] can
[00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:08.970] see
[00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:09.090] the
[00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:09.250] time
[00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:09.370] of
[00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:09.550] day
[00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:09.970] moving
[00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:10.750] right
[00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.870] over
[00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:11.150] here.
[00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:12.010] And
[00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:12.110] you
[00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:12.250] can
[00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:12.470] see
[00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.970] that
[00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:13.650] relative
[00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:13.950] to
[00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:14.330] our
[00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:14.950] vintage
[00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:15.370] point
[00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:15.730] on
[00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:15.870] the
[00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:16.090] surface
[00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:16.270] of
[00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.350] the
[00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:16.510] Earth,
[00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:17.270] this
[00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.710] little
[00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.970] yellow
[00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:18.230] dot
[00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.510] here
[00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:18.750] and
[00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.910] this
[00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:19.130] yellow
[00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.510] line
[00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:20.010] is
[00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:20.330] tracing
[00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:20.690] through
[00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.870] the
[00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:21.110] path
[00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:21.230] of
[00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.330] the
[00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:21.470] sun
[00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.570] in
[00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:21.690] the
[00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:21.910] sky
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:22.840] from
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.160] our
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:23.940] perspective.
[00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:24.900] And
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:25.020] so
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:25.160] as
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:25.260] we
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:25.380] go
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:25.540] through
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:25.720] the
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.060] seasons,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:27.240] I'm
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:27.300] going
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:27.380] to
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:27.560] speed
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:27.680] it
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:27.780] up
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:27.940] just
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.060] a
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:28.180] little
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:28.400] bit
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:28.560] so
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:28.740] that
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:28.960] we
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:29.560] pay
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:29.760] more
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:30.100] attention
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:30.480] to
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.080] the
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:31.720] position
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:31.900] of
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.040] this
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:32.340] yellow
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:32.680] line
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:32.820] and
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:33.600] less
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.040] attention
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:34.300] to
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:34.460] the
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:34.720] diurnal
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.140] variations.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:35.340] We're
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:35.520] paying
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:35.680] more
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:35.900] attention
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.060] to
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:36.200] the
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:36.420] seasonal
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:36.840] variations.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:37.460] I'm
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:37.560] going
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:37.700] to
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:37.860] vary
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:38.040] the
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:38.300] seasons
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:38.500] by
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:38.780] force
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:38.900] here.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:39.020] I'm
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:39.120] going
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:39.260] to
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:39.460] go
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.040] back
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:40.200] to
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:40.580] July
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:41.200] or
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:41.460] June,
[00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:42.750] if
[00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.810] I
[00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:42.990] may.
[00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:43.550] Here
[00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.630] we
[00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:43.750] go.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:46.260] Yeah,
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:46.600] so
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.220] there's
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:47.320] a
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:47.480] number
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:47.620] of
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:47.900] other
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:48.500] lines
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:48.680] right
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:48.820] here.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:48.900] And
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.000] they're
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:49.160] all
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:49.500] explained
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:49.820] very
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:50.300] carefully.
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:51.860] There's
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:52.260] the
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.860] hour
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:54.000] of
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:54.420] ascension,
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:54.660] which
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:54.820] would
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:55.380] be
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.680] prime
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:50:59.280] hour
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:50:59.540] circle.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:50:59.820] So
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.120] I
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:00.420] believe
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.300] I'd
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:01.380] have
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:01.460] to
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:01.560] go
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:01.760] back
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:01.880] and
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.020] double
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:02.220] check
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:02.400] all
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:02.520] of
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:02.720] this.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:03.140] But
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:03.240] I
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:03.460] believe
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:03.640] they
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:03.940] relate
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:04.240] to
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:05.460] what
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:05.600] would
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:05.680] be
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:05.840] the
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.260] sunrise
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:06.480] and
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:06.760] sunset
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:06.920] of
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:07.020] that
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:07.200] given
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:07.360] day.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:07.620] Let's
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:07.760] see
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:07.860] if
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.200] our
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:08.720] hypothesis
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:08.900] is
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:09.080] correct.
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:09.320] No,
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:09.960] it
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.080] is
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:10.300] not.
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:11.880] That
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.020] would
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:12.260] have
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:12.420] to
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:12.840] be,
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:13.700] since
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:13.920] it's
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.280] varying
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:14.660] in
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:14.760] a
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.040] systematic
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:15.340] way
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:15.500] from
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.000] January
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.040] through
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.020] the
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:18.240] summer
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:18.520] and
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:18.640] then
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:18.840] back
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:18.980] to
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:19.080] the
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:19.260] winter,
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:20.140] I'm
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:20.420] imagining
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:20.600] this
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:20.760] has
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:20.980] something
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.120] to
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:21.180] do
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:21.300] with
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:21.420] the
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:21.780] direction
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:22.660] of
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:23.040] the
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:23.300] sun
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.240] relative
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:24.400] to
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:24.520] the
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:24.640] Earth
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:24.880] as
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.020] it
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:25.300] traces
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:25.680] that
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.220] ellipse
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:26.400] through
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:26.540] the
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:26.760] sky.
[00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:28.290] So
[00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:28.430] let's
[00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.550] pay
[00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:28.790] attention
[00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.910] to
[00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:29.030] that
[00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.250] yellow
[00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:29.490] line
[00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:29.670] for
[00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.750] a
[00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.830] minute.
[00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:30.130] That's
[00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:30.290] the
[00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:30.470] one
[00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.550] I
[00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:30.730] want
[00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:30.870] to
[00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:31.150] attract
[00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:31.510] everybody's
[00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.770] attention
[00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:31.990] to.
[00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:32.670] Now
[00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:32.850] we're
[00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:33.110] in
[00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:33.370] June,
[00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.970] so
[00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:34.090] in
[00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:34.190] the
[00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.310] height
[00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:34.430] of
[00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.650] summer.
[00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:35.230] And
[00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.510] relative
[00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.690] to
[00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.850] this
[00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:36.170] observer
[00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.390] right
[00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.530] here,
[00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:36.710] the
[00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.870] sun
[00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:37.130] is
[00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.770] further
[00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:38.010] up
[00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:38.110] in
[00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:38.230] the
[00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.490] sky,
[00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.930] just
[00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:39.110] like
[00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:39.290] we
[00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:39.750] traced
[00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.950] out
[00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:40.110] right
[00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:40.250] there.
[00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.930] And
[00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:41.090] now
[00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:41.190] as
[00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.310] we
[00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:41.570] go
[00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:42.130] to
[00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:42.570] winter,
[00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:43.190] that
[00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.430] line
[00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.710] drops
[00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:44.030] closer
[00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.190] to
[00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.310] the
[00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:44.650] horizon.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:45.760] So
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:45.880] a
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:46.040] couple
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:46.160] of
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:46.360] things
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:46.620] happen.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:46.800] If
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:46.940] we
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:47.280] look
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.120] like
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:48.380] this,
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:48.520] for
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:48.840] instance,
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.140] now
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:49.240] we're
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:49.440] looking
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:49.700] straight
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:49.940] down
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.040] on
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.140] the
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:50.420] observer.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:51.800] In
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:52.240] wintertime,
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:53.000] the
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:53.200] sun
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:53.400] will
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:53.940] rise
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:54.400] in
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:54.560] the
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:54.960] southeast.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.000] And
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:56.140] it'll
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:56.400] trace
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:56.580] this
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:56.780] arc
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:56.940] through
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:57.100] the
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:57.400] sky
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.000] and
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:58.340] set
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:58.460] in
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:58.600] the
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:58.860] southwest
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:51:59.220] over
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:51:59.500] here.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:00.400] In
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:00.540] the
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:00.860] summertime,
[00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:02.910] the
[00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:03.330] sun
[00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:03.550] will
[00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:04.090] rise
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.140] almost
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:06.340] in
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:06.460] the
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:07.080] northeast,
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.160] north
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:08.300] of
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:09.240] east,
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.760] just
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.040] slightly
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:11.240] north
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:11.360] of
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:11.580] east.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:12.420] And
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.140] that's
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:13.380] why
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:13.540] if
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:13.660] you
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:13.880] have
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:13.980] a
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.140] north
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:14.380]-facing
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:14.700] window
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:14.880] and
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:14.980] you
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:15.120] put
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:15.220] your
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:15.400] little
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:15.720] plant
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:15.840] on
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:15.940] the
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:16.420] windowsill,
[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:16.960] it'll
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.120] get
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:17.240] a
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:17.340] little
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:17.500] bit
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:17.600] of
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:17.800] direct
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.260] sunlight
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:18.720] early
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:18.840] in
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:18.940] the
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:19.140] morning
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:19.300] and
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:19.440] late
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:19.560] at
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:19.820] night.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:20.480] It's
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:20.580] when
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:20.740] the
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:20.900] sun
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:21.120] is
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:21.560] tracing
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:21.780] this
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:22.100] part
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:22.500] or
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:22.720] that
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.000] part
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.200] through,
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:23.820] it's
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:24.080] tracing
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:24.280] the
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:24.500] sky.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:25.500] So
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:25.640] it's
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:25.840] worth
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:26.060] sitting
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:26.320] down
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:26.580] with
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:26.740] one
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:26.860] of
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:27.140] these
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:27.800] plots,
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:28.520] toying
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:28.800] around
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.020] with
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:29.200] it,
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:29.740] getting
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.240] accustomed
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:30.500] to
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:30.600] it,
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:30.700] and
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.080] understanding
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:31.380] really
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:31.600] how
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:31.800] the
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.000] sun
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:32.540] traces
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:32.760] its
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:32.980] arc
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:33.460] throughout
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:33.660] the
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:33.840] sky
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.200] relative
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:34.400] to
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:34.560] our
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:34.900] position
[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:35.120] right
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:35.300] here
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:35.380] on
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:35.480] the
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:35.640] Earth.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:36.320] If
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:36.540] we
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:36.860] shift
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.060] this
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:37.300] further
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:37.520] up
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:37.940] north,
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:39.000] really
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:39.400] interesting
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:39.680] things
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:39.900] begin
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:40.040] to
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:40.300] happen.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:40.720] So
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:40.860] for
[00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:41.080] example,
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:41.280] my
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:41.480] wife
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:41.580] is
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:41.740] from
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:42.020] Sweden.
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:42.660] If
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:42.760] we
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:42.860] go
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:42.960] to
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.140] her
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:43.400] hometown
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:43.680] right
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:43.980] here
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:44.500] in
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:44.600] the
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:44.700] middle
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:44.860] of
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:45.360] summertime,
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:45.960] right
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:46.060] at
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:46.180] the
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:46.640] solstice,
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.140] you
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:47.280] can
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:47.440] see
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:47.640] the
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:47.940] sun
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.300] traces
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:49.680] this
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.100] awesome
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:50.500] route
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:50.940] from
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:51.340] north
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:51.500] to
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:51.840] north,
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:52.980] barely
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:53.360] leaving
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:53.520] the
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:53.940] horizon.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:54.340] If
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:54.480] we
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:54.660] look
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:54.860] at,
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.140] again,
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:56.320] from
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:56.460] the
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:56.780] perspective
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:56.980] of
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:57.080] the
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:57.220] little
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:57.460] creature
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:57.800] here,
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:58.640] that
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.940] yellow
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:00.460] arc
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:00.660] is
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:00.900] really
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:01.160] close
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:01.260] to
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:01.360] the
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:01.680] horizon.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:02.940] Maybe
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.100] it
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:03.360] goes
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:03.500] up
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:03.720] about
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:03.900] that
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.240] high,
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:04.880] but
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.220] it
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:05.520] continues
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:05.780] going
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:05.960] all
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.040] the
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:06.160] way
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:06.260] to
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:06.400] the
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:06.680] north.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:07.320] And
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:07.460] if
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:07.620] you
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:07.920] keep
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:08.140] going
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:08.400] north,
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:08.540] it
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:08.660] will
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:08.960] never
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.440] set
[00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:10.450] during
[00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:10.570] the
[00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:10.670] middle
[00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.790] of
[00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.970] summer.
[00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:11.410] It'll
[00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:11.710] just
[00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.530] be
[00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.870] light
[00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:13.130] all
[00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.250] the
[00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.490] time.
[00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.830] And
[00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:13.910] you
[00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:14.030] can
[00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.170] see
[00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:14.330] here,
[00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:14.450] it
[00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.590] just
[00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:14.830] traces
[00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:15.070] that
[00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:15.250] orbit
[00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:15.450] right
[00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:15.630] around
[00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.770] there.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:16.700] It's
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:16.840] all
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:17.060] trig,
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:17.400] folks.
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:17.980] We
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:18.100] can
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:18.260] do
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:18.380] it.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:18.500] We
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:18.620] can
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:18.780] sit
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:19.020] down,
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:19.120] and
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:19.200] we
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:19.320] can
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:19.480] work
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:19.580] through
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:19.680] the
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.060] equations
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:20.420] by
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:20.760] hand.
[00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:22.010] I
[00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:22.130] did
[00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.270] that
[00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.590] once.
[00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.790] It
[00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.890] took
[00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:22.990] me
[00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.090] a
[00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:23.210] long
[00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.470] time.
[00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.610] I
[00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:23.750] didn't
[00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.930] learn
[00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:24.070] that
[00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:24.330] much.
[00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:26.310] I
[00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:26.650] would
[00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:27.270] instead
[00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.770] advise
[00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.890] you
[00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.970] to
[00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:28.070] go
[00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:28.170] to
[00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:28.310] one
[00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:28.390] of
[00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.590] these
[00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:29.150] simulations
[00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.630] right
[00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:30.010] here,
[00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:30.370] but
[00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:30.470] to
[00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.770] understand
[00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:31.030] all
[00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.170] the
[00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:31.430] inputs
[00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.730] into
[00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.870] it,
[00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:32.010] all
[00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:32.170] the
[00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:32.510] different
[00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:33.570] components,
[00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:33.890] right?
[00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:34.050] The
[00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:34.250] fact
[00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:34.370] that
[00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:35.010] the
[00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:35.170] Earth
[00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:35.310] is
[00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:35.510] moving
[00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.750] around
[00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.910] the
[00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:36.090] sun
[00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:36.510] as
[00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.590] a
[00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:36.970] declination
[00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:37.390] angle,
[00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:38.850] seasonal
[00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:39.230] variations,
[00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:39.430] and
[00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.570] so
[00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:39.830] forth.
[00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:40.550] Very
[00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:40.830] useful
[00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:41.130] tool.
[00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:41.490] You
[00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:41.650] have
[00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:41.770] the
[00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:42.050] website
[00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:42.370] link
[00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:42.590] right
[00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:42.870] here.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:44.900] And
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:45.240] yeah.
[00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:48.170] So
[00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.570] from
[00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:48.810] this
[00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:49.130] tool,
[00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:50.110] actually
[00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:50.530] one
[00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:50.930] last
[00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:51.290] tiny,
[00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.510] tiny
[00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.770] thing.
[00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.310] From
[00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:52.490] this
[00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:52.670] tool
[00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.850] right
[00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:53.170] here,
[00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:54.150] we
[00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.330] can
[00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:54.810] understand
[00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:55.270] why.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:56.660] OK,
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:56.840] this
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:57.380] is
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:57.480] a
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:57.880] real
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:58.620] stretch.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:53:59.100] And
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:53:59.600] forgive
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:53:59.940] me
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.680] social
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.060] scientists
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:02.240] in
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:02.340] the
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:02.460] room
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:02.640] for
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:02.840] doing
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.040] this,
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:03.220] but
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:03.920] I
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.160] have
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:04.420] to
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:05.020] project
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:05.200] a
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:05.320] little
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:05.460] bit
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:05.580] of
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:05.900] science
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:06.200] onto
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:06.500] human
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:06.840] behavior.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.600] How
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.180] far
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:10.420] west
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.280] is
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:11.640] Madrid
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.080] from
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.000] GMT?
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:14.200] Madrid,
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:14.560] Spain.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:15.840] It's
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.020] three
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:16.320] degrees
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:16.660] west
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.160] of
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.160] the
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:18.320] Great
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:18.620] Meridian,
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.080] right?
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:19.640] So
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:19.960] the
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:20.220] line
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:20.380] that
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:20.700] divides
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:20.960] the
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:21.180] east
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:21.280] and
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:21.360] the
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:21.560] west
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.080] hemispheres
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:22.680] is
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:22.820] three
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:23.020] degrees
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:23.280] west.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:24.040] But
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:24.220] it
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:24.400] is
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:24.660] one
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:25.000] time
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:25.280] zone
[00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:26.790] earlier
[00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:27.770] than
[00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:28.810] London,
[00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:29.130] right?
[00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.370] So
[00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:30.090] it's
[00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:30.510] in
[00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.630] the
[00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.790] same
[00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:31.050] time
[00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:31.190] zone
[00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.350] as
[00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:31.650] Germany
[00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:32.210] and
[00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.330] all
[00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:32.450] the
[00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.650] other
[00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:32.970] cities
[00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:33.250] that
[00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:34.010] are
[00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:35.370] east
[00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:36.090] of
[00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:36.670] London.
[00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:37.410] And
[00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:37.550] this
[00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:37.690] is
[00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:37.870] just
[00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:38.170] for
[00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:38.670] convenience
[00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:39.070] factor.
[00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.710] If
[00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.830] you're
[00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:40.050] traveling
[00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:40.270] from
[00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.490] one
[00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.850] continental
[00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:41.210] European
[00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.570] country
[00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:41.750] to
[00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.890] the
[00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:42.050] other,
[00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:42.450] it
[00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:42.610] just
[00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:42.950] makes
[00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:43.190] sense
[00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.350] to
[00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:43.510] have
[00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.750] everything
[00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.910] be
[00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.990] on
[00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.090] the
[00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:44.230] same
[00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.450] time
[00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.650] zone.
[00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:44.750] You
[00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.890] get
[00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:45.010] to
[00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:45.150] work
[00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.230] at
[00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.330] the
[00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:45.470] same
[00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.710] time
[00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.930] sort
[00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:46.050] of.
[00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.490] Pick
[00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.590] up
[00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:46.710] the
[00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.870] phone,
[00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:47.090] call
[00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:47.430] somebody.
[00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:48.390] You're
[00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.650] doing
[00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:48.950] business.
[00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:49.750] Now,
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.120] relative
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:51.680] to
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.720] everybody
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:53.080] else
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:53.240] in
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:53.480] Europe,
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:53.780] though,
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:54.600] is
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:54.840] the
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:55.100] sun
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:55.520] setting
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.420] later
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:56.700] or
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.020] earlier
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:57.800] if
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:57.960] you're
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:58.140] that
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:58.360] far
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:58.660] west
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:58.800] in
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:54:58.940] your
[00:54:58.940 --> 00:54:59.140] time
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:54:59.360] zone?
[00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:00.950] Later,
[00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:01.270] right?
[00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:01.430] So
[00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.590] the
[00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:01.770] sun
[00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:01.930] is
[00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:02.210] setting
[00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:02.530] later
[00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:03.190] if
[00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.350] you're
[00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:03.570] there.
[00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:04.250] So
[00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:04.510] if
[00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.750] you're
[00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:05.150] eating
[00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.710] according
[00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.890] to
[00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:06.050] the
[00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:06.190] sun,
[00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:06.370] not
[00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:06.570] according
[00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:06.690] to
[00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:06.790] what
[00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:06.930] your
[00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:07.390] watch
[00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:07.530] is
[00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:07.770] saying,
[00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:07.950] but
[00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:08.090] if
[00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:08.590] you're
[00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:08.790] choosing
[00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:08.970] to
[00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:09.130] eat
[00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:09.410] dinner
[00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:10.010] when
[00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.190] the
[00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.350] sun
[00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:10.490] is
[00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.770] setting,
[00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.730] when
[00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:11.930] will
[00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:12.130] your
[00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:12.450] watch
[00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:12.750] say,
[00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:13.130] oh
[00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.350] my
[00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:13.590] goodness,
[00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.850] it's
[00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:14.070] really
[00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:14.410] late?
[00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:15.090] When
[00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:15.250] you're
[00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:15.330] in
[00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:15.550] Berlin
[00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:15.730] or
[00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:15.930] when
[00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:16.130] you're
[00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:16.310] in
[00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:16.610] Madrid?
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:17.700] When
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:17.820] you're
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:17.900] in
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:18.180] Madrid,
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:18.700] right?
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:20.580] So
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:20.980] again,
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:21.220] I'm
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:21.380] not
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:21.580] saying
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:21.720] that
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:21.880] this
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.000] is
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:22.180] the
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:22.420] sole
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:22.760] reason
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.240] for
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.520] social
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:24.900] behavior
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:25.120] being
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:25.260] a
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:25.340] little
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:25.620] different
[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:25.740] on
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:25.840] the
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.080] Iberian
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:26.440] Peninsula
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.080] since
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:27.420] Portugal
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:27.740] also
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:27.920] eats
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.120] very
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:28.320] late
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:28.440] and
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:28.600] they're
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:28.740] in
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:28.840] the
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:29.000] same
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:29.200] time
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:29.340] zone
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:29.500] as
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:29.720] London.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:30.320] But
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:30.840] it
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.020] could
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:31.160] be
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:31.280] a
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:31.580] contributing
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.060] factor,
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:32.340] right?
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:32.520] The
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:32.660] sun
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:32.780] is
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:33.020] still
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:33.580] up
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:33.680] in
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:33.820] the
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.060] sky
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:34.300] when
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:34.600] it's
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:34.980] 5
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:35.360] PM
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:35.960] in
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.240] winter,
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:36.480] let's
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:36.660] say,
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:36.820] and
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:37.040] where
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:37.160] in
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:37.400] Germany
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:37.740] it's
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:38.020] set
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:38.120] a
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:38.200] long
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:38.400] time
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:38.560] ago.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:40.500] So
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:40.700] these
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:40.980] are
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:41.260] just
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:41.460] little
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:41.700] things
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:41.840] to
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:42.000] keep
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.120] in
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.420] mind.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:42.780] An
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:42.960] easy
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:43.100] way
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:43.240] to
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:43.620] calculate
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:43.940] that,
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:44.280] an
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:44.380] easy
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:44.480] way
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:44.540] to
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:44.860] calculate
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:45.120] that,
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:45.300] when
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:45.440] is
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:45.620] the
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:45.800] solar
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.060] noon,
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:46.740] you
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.080] look
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:47.220] at
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:47.400] the
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:47.660] Earth
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:47.880] more
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:47.960] or
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:48.060] less
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:48.220] like
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:48.340] we're
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:48.580] looking
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:48.780] at
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:49.240] this
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:49.460] right
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:49.700] now.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:49.840] We
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:49.960] have
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.600] 360
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.060] degrees.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:51.560] We
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:51.880] divide
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.080] that
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.260] into
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.060] 24
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:53.580] time
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:53.960] zones.
[00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:55.070] And
[00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:55.170] then
[00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:55.290] we
[00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:55.470] say,
[00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:55.630] OK,
[00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.830] about
[00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:56.230] 15
[00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.530] degrees
[00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:56.890] each.
[00:55:57.970 --> 00:55:58.370] And
[00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.590] then
[00:55:58.590 --> 00:55:58.910] we
[00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:59.210] can
[00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.390] begin
[00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.690] counting
[00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.890] from
[00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:00.050] there.
[00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.530] If
[00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:01.230] in
[00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.570] Boston
[00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:01.750] we're
[00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:02.070] 41
[00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:02.370] degrees
[00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:02.650] north,
[00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:02.830] but
[00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:02.970] we're
[00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:03.430] 71
[00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.790] degrees
[00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:04.230] west,
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.300] we
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:05.440] can
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:05.620] say,
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:05.800] OK,
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:05.980] we
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:06.180] should
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:06.420] be,
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:06.960] for
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.380] GMT
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:07.660] minus
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:07.980] 5,
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:08.120] we
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:08.260] should
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:08.340] be
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:08.420] at
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:08.700] around
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.600] 75
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.200] degrees.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:10.560] And
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:10.680] so
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:10.800] we're
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:10.900] a
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:10.980] little
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:11.460] earlier.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:11.900] So
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:12.180] we
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:12.340] do
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:12.600] things
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:12.720] a
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:12.840] little
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.220] earlier
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:13.520] around
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:13.720] here
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:13.860] than
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:14.020] what
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:14.160] the
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:14.340] solar
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:14.540] noon
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:14.720] should
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:14.920] be
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:15.260] telling
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:15.440] us
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:15.540] to
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:15.680] do
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:15.940] things.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:16.840] Wake
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.000] up
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:17.120] a
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:17.180] little
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:17.440] earlier,
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:17.600] go
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:17.700] to
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:17.800] bed
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:17.900] a
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:18.020] little
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:18.300] earlier.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:18.440] And
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:18.600] that's
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:18.800] why
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.340] students
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:19.460] are
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:19.760] like,
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:19.980] dang,
[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:20.180] there's
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:20.300] no
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:20.700] nightlife
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:20.900] around
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:21.100] here.
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:21.580] I'm
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:21.680] not
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:21.800] saying
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:21.980] that's
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:22.100] the
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:22.360] only
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:22.720] reason,
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:23.120] but
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:23.320] it
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:23.440] could
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:23.560] be
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:23.700] a
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:24.020] contributing
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:24.500] factor,
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:25.600] whereas
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:25.800] the
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:26.020] opposite
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:26.480] happens
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.660] when
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:27.860] you're
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:28.160] far
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:28.580] west
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:28.840] in
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:28.960] your
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:29.160] time
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:29.360] zone.
[00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:30.410] OK,
[00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.890] so
[00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:31.570] again,
[00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:31.810] just
[00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:32.070] trying
[00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:32.190] to
[00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.370] wrap
[00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:32.510] our
[00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.710] heads
[00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:33.110] around
[00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:33.570] the
[00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:34.010] solar
[00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.470] resource
[00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.610] and
[00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:34.890] around
[00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:35.550] the
[00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:35.730] world
[00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:36.050] around
[00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:36.230] us
[00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.370] so
[00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:36.550] that
[00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:36.950] we
[00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:37.090] can
[00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:37.290] answer
[00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:37.450] that
[00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:37.610] little
[00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:37.890] child
[00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:37.970] in
[00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:38.070] the
[00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:38.330] shopping
[00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:38.530] mall
[00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:38.630] when
[00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.730] they
[00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:38.850] come
[00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:38.950] with
[00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:39.290] questions.
[00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:40.170] What
[00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:40.270] are
[00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.530] these?
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:44.120] Solar
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:44.480] trash
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:44.980] compactors,
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:45.200] right?
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:45.320] At
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:45.500] the
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:46.500] student
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:46.800] center.
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:47.240] Anas
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:47.560] Thakuri
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:47.740] is
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:47.900] right
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:48.040] over
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:48.280] there.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:49.220] Dunkin'
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:49.440] Donuts
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:49.580] is
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:49.800] there,
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.040] right?
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:50.620] So
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:51.000] these
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:51.160] are
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:51.500] solar
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:51.820] panels
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:52.120] mounted
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:52.280] on
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:52.400] the
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:52.600] tops
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:52.740] of
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:52.980] those.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.240] And
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:54.680] what
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:54.980] the
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:55.200] solar
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:55.700] is
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:56.020] doing
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:56.180] is
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:56.480] charging
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:56.640] a
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:56.860] battery
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:57.300] inside.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:57.980] Once
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:58.160] the
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:58.380] trash
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:56:58.640] reaches
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:58.800] a
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.000] critical
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:56:59.260] level,
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:56:59.420] a
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:56:59.660] sensor
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:56:59.820] is
[00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:00.100] triggered,
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.080] it
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:01.480] stops
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:01.620] you
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:01.780] from
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:02.020] opening
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:02.220] this
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:02.540] bin,
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:03.020] and
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:03.160] it
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:03.660] compacts
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:03.800] the
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:04.180] trash,
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:05.160] and
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:05.400] then
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.200] releases,
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:06.560] and
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:06.720] allows
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:06.820] you
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:06.900] to
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:07.060] open
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:07.180] and
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:07.300] put
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:07.460] more
[00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:07.700] stuff
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:07.880] in.
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:08.480] And
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:08.600] what
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:08.700] it
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:08.880] does
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:08.980] is
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:09.120] it
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:09.560] minimizes
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:09.760] the
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:09.940] number
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:10.060] of
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:10.340] times
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:10.700] between
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:11.060] trash
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:11.500] pickups.
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:12.020] If
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:12.380] labor
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:12.720] is
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:12.860] a
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:13.080] large
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:13.520] portion
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:13.640] of
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:13.720] the
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:14.060] cost
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:14.960] of
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.340] trash
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.880] management,
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:17.320] of
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:17.620] waste,
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:17.840] of
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.120] refuse
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:18.520] management,
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.300] then
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:19.940] it
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:20.360] eliminates
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:20.540] some
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:20.620] of
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:20.720] the
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:20.960] labor,
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:21.740] transferring
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:21.860] it
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:22.060] instead
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:22.200] to
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:22.320] the
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:22.720] technology.
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:23.640] And
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:23.920] so
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.600] installing
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.020] these
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:25.740] at
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:25.860] the
[00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:26.040] student
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:26.340] center,
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:27.240] I
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:27.320] had
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:27.420] a
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:27.500] little
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:27.640] bit
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:27.720] of
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:27.840] a
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:27.980] pet
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:28.320] peeve.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:33.620] So
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:34.100] you
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:34.460] have
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:35.160] the
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:35.660] angle
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:35.800] of
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:35.920] the
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.080] sun
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:36.260] right
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:36.420] here,
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:36.580] which
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:36.680] we
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:36.860] just
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:37.140] walked
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:37.300] through,
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:37.640] 18
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.060] degrees
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:38.240] in
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:38.540] summer.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:39.340] And
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.480] it
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:40.800] just
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.000] so
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:41.280] happened
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:41.460] to
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:41.680] work
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.080] out
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:42.560] that,
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:43.180] and
[00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:43.420] these
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:43.660] numbers
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:43.840] were
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:44.240] approximate.
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:44.500] This
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:44.620] was
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:44.820] me
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:45.060] going
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:45.240] with
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:45.440] my
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:45.580] kind
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:45.680] of
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:45.960] engineering
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.360] sense.
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:46.540] That's
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:46.740] about
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.120] 45
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:47.480] degrees.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:47.720] Count
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:47.860] the
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:48.000] number
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:48.120] of
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:48.420] paces,
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:50.200] equilateral
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:50.660] triangle,
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.300] estimate
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:51.520] the
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:51.660] height
[00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:51.760] of
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:51.860] there.
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:53.060] But
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:53.540] in
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:53.700] the
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:53.860] middle
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:54.040] of
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:54.400] summertime,
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:54.640] when
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:54.760] you
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:54.900] are
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:55.020] at
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:55.160] the
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:55.680] solstice,
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:56.580] there
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:56.760] is
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.160] no
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.140] direct
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:57:58.540] sunlight
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:58.960] hitting
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.180] this
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:57:59.480] trash
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:57:59.740] can
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:00.040] because
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:00.200] of
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:00.360] that
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:00.780] overhang
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:00.940] way
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:01.080] up
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:01.280] there.
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.020] That's
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:02.160] not
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:02.300] a
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:02.560] problem
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:02.780] for
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:03.100] this
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:03.960] particular
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:04.280] trash
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:04.600] collector,
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:04.880] since
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:05.140] those
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:05.420] panels
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:05.600] are
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:05.840] way
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.220] oversized
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:06.640] for
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:06.760] the
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:06.920] amount
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.040] of
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:07.280] energy
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:07.640] that
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:07.880] the
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:08.080] trash
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:08.360] collector
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:08.620] actually
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:08.980] needs.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:09.760] And
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.700] there
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:10.900] is
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:11.020] a
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:11.180] fair
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:11.320] amount
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:11.420] of
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:11.500] what
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:11.620] we
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:11.780] call
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:12.240] diffuse
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:12.720] sunlight,
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:13.080] meaning
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:13.380] sunlight
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:13.620] being
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:13.920] scattered
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.200] off
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:14.300] of
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:14.480] other
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:14.760] things.
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:15.040] That's
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:15.200] why
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:15.720] this
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.040] portion
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:16.200] of
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:16.440] the
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:16.800] image
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.040] looks
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:17.380] white.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:18.140] It
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:18.280] wouldn't
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:18.440] look
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:18.640] white
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:18.760] if
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:18.860] there
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:18.960] was
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.100] no
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:19.340] diffuse
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:19.620] scatter,
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.100] black,
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:20.460] pitch
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:20.740] black,
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:21.000] if
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:21.100] there
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:21.220] was
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:21.680] nothing
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:21.940] to
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:22.140] scatter
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:22.300] the
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:22.440] light
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:22.640] off.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.100] Like
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:23.200] in
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:23.340] outer
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:23.700] space,
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:23.920] there's
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.120] nothing
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:24.280] to
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:24.500] scatter.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:24.740] That's
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:24.860] why
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:25.760] it
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:25.900] looks
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:26.040] like
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:26.200] a
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:26.540] black
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:26.820] night.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:28.400] But
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:28.640] instead,
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:28.900] there's
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:29.120] a
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:29.300] large
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:29.460] amount
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:29.580] of
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:29.840] diffuse
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.120] light.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:30.280] There
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:30.420] is
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:30.580] still
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:30.780] some
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:31.020] sunlight
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:31.380] reaching
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:31.540] it.
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:31.680] And
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:31.840] since
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.020] the
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:32.260] panels
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:32.560] are
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:32.740] way
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:33.220] oversized
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:33.660] and
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:34.000] the
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:34.240] system
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:34.360] is
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:34.860] overengineered,
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:35.700] it
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:35.920] still
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:36.200] manages
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:36.560] to
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.140] acquire
[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:37.400] enough
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:37.680] energy
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:37.880] to
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:38.220] compact
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:38.400] the
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:38.660] trash.
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:38.800] And
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:38.880] it
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:39.080] doesn't
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:39.220] have
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:39.340] a
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:39.620] catastrophic
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:40.240] stop.
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:40.740] But
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:40.880] it
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:41.120] was
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:41.260] an
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:41.600] example
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:41.880] of
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.620] somebody
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:42.880] not
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.180] really
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:43.520] thinking
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.160] much
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:44.440] about
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:44.600] the
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:44.920] direction
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:45.120] or
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:45.740] the
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:46.780] angle
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:46.920] of
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:47.000] the
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:47.120] sun
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:47.240] in
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:47.360] the
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:47.620] sky.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.080] They
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:48.380] probably
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:48.840] installed
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:49.000] it
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:49.240] sometime
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:49.500] around
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:49.820] March,
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.020] right
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:50.120] when
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:50.260] the
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:50.500] snow
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:50.940] started
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:51.120] to
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:51.340] melt
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:51.660] and
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:51.780] the
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:51.920] sun
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.080] was
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:52.280] right
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:52.460] around
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:52.820] here.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:54.120] And
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:54.360] so
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.440] the
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:55.740] angle
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:56.000] was
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:56.480] around
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:56.740] there.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:56.960] And
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:57.260] it
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:57.580] made
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:57.680] it
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:57.860] into
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:58.180] the
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:58.460] trash
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:58:58.760] collectors.
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:58:59.060] But
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.640] as
[00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:00.970] the
[00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:01.470] summer
[00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:01.690] came
[00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:01.930] along,
[00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.410] it
[00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:02.610] got
[00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:02.850] shaded.
[00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.650] So
[00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.910] it's
[00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:04.070] something
[00:59:04.070 --> 00:59:04.250] to
[00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.410] keep
[00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:04.550] in
[00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:04.870] mind
[00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.690] when
[00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.910] doing
[00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:06.070] a
[00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:06.250] solar
[00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:06.770] installation.
[00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:06.990] It
[00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.170] is
[00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:07.630] important
[00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:08.050] to
[00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:08.410] calculate
[00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:08.690] these
[00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.950] things.
[00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:09.490] And
[00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:09.550] I
[00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:09.750] just
[00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:10.010] pick
[00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.150] out
[00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.350] one
[00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:10.570] small
[00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:10.970] example.
[00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:11.730] I'd
[00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:11.950] encourage
[00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:12.070] you
[00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:12.170] to
[00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.330] walk
[00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:12.490] through.
[00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:12.630] I
[00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.770] was
[00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.950] going
[00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:13.130] to
[00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.470] have
[00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:13.630] that
[00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:13.790] be
[00:59:13.790 --> 00:59:14.070] a
[00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:14.350] small
[00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:14.510] little
[00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.690] in
[00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.870]-class
[00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:15.270] example.
[00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:15.430] But
[00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.630] since
[00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:15.770] we're
[00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.910] running
[00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:16.130] short
[00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:16.270] on
[00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.550] time,
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:18.980] I'll
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:19.080] just
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:19.220] give
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:19.300] it
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:19.360] to
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:19.440] you
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:19.580] like
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:19.820] that.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.080] OK,
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:21.580] fixed
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:21.920] versus
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.280] tracking
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:22.780] systems.
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:23.360] So
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:23.620] if
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:23.820] the
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:23.980] sun
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:24.240] is
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:24.660] moving
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:25.640] as
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:25.800] a
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.020] function
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:26.520] of
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.020] season
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:27.340] and
[00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:27.500] as
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:27.640] a
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:27.900] function
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:28.360] of
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:28.860] time
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:29.020] of
[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:29.280] day
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:29.860] throughout
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.080] the
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:30.380] sky,
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:30.680] and
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:30.800] we
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:30.920] can
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:31.120] see
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:31.260] that
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:31.480] very
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:31.820] nicely,
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:32.900] again,
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.060] through
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:33.200] our
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:33.360] demo
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:33.620] right
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:33.920] here.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.080] So
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:35.400] if
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:35.800] the
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:35.940] sun
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:36.120] is
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:36.620] actually
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:36.980] moving,
[00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:39.250] one
[00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:39.730] embodiment
[00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:40.070] would
[00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:40.430] say,
[00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.830] OK,
[00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.410] I
[00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:41.570] know
[00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:41.770] more
[00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:41.870] or
[00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:42.050] less
[00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:42.230] what
[00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.390] the
[00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.530] sun
[00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:42.650] is
[00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:42.770] going
[00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:42.870] to
[00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:43.170] do
[00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:43.550] as
[00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:43.650] a
[00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:43.830] function
[00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:44.010] of
[00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:44.230] season.
[00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:44.550] Forget
[00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:44.690] the
[00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.970] diurnal
[00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:45.410] variations,
[00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:45.650] but
[00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:45.790] just
[00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:45.910] the
[00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:46.130] seasonal
[00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.570] variations.
[00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:47.290] I
[00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:47.430] know
[00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.570] that
[00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:47.710] the
[00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:47.850] sun
[00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:47.950] is
[00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:48.090] going
[00:59:48.090 --> 00:59:48.190] to
[00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.310] be,
[00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:48.430] on
[00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.730] average,
[00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:49.130] somewhere
[00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.410] around
[00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:49.730] here,
[00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:50.550] somewhere
[00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:50.810] around
[00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:51.010] my
[00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:51.310] latitude.
[00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.230] So
[00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.490] if
[00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.630] I
[00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.890] point
[00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:53.110] my
[00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:53.470] panel
[00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:54.230] at
[00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.670] latitude
[00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:55.250] tilt,
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:57.420] since
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:57.900] this
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.220] angle
[00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:58.820] was,
[00:59:58.960 --> 00:59:59.200] what
[00:59:59.200 --> 00:59:59.360] was
[00:59:59.360 --> 00:59:59.520] it,
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.040] 41
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:00.480] plus
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:00.940] 23,
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:01.580] this
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:01.820] angle
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.000] was
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:02.340] 41
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:02.600] minus
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:02.980] 23.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.180] So
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:03.340] this
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:03.460] one
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:03.580] would
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:03.760] be
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:04.100] right
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.220] around
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:04.600] 41
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.180] latitude.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:06.140] So
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:06.300] if
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:06.460] I
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:06.760] aim
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.100] my
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:07.340] solar
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:07.760] panels
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:08.160] at
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:08.540] latitude
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:08.900] tilt,
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:09.860] then
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.120] I'm
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:10.280] going
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:10.440] to
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:10.720] get,
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:11.340] on
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:11.620] average,
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.080] some
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:12.240] pretty
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:12.480] decent
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:12.780] power
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:12.980] throughout
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:13.140] the
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:13.260] year.
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:14.760] I'll
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:14.880] have
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:14.980] a
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.060] little
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.340] less
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:15.460] in
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:15.780] winter,
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:16.360] a
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:16.440] little
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:16.640] more
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:16.800] in
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.160] summer,
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.160] just
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:19.480] because
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:19.600] of
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:19.680] the
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:19.840] amount
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:19.960] of
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:20.120] solar
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:20.480] resources
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:20.920] available.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:21.360] But
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:21.520] all
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:21.600] in
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:21.720] all,
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.260] I'll
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:22.380] be
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:22.500] all
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:22.720] right.
[01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:24.470] At
[01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.710] most,
[01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.850] I'll
[01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:24.990] be
[01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.190] off
[01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.470] by
[01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:26.310] 23
[01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:26.470] and
[01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.550] 1
[01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:26.750] half
[01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:27.390] degrees.
[01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:29.030] You
[01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.150] can
[01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.270] do
[01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.510] that,
[01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:29.770] and
[01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:29.970] that's
[01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:30.250] called
[01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:30.690] fixed
[01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:31.370] latitude
[01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.710] tilt.
[01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.870] And
[01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:32.230] typically,
[01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:32.530] you'll
[01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:32.770] face
[01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:32.930] the
[01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:33.210] panels
[01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:33.890] south,
[01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.490] approximately.
[01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:35.370] We'll
[01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:35.490] get
[01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:35.570] to
[01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:35.690] that
[01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:35.790] in
[01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:35.850] a
[01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:35.970] minute.
[01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:36.290] Depends
[01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:36.390] on
[01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.610] local
[01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:36.830] weather
[01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:37.150] patterns.
[01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.510] If
[01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.550] you
[01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:37.650] have
[01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:37.850] fog
[01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:37.950] in
[01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:38.030] the
[01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.210] morning,
[01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:38.370] for
[01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:38.570] instance,
[01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.710] you
[01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.810] want
[01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:39.030] to
[01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.250] face
[01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:39.350] them
[01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:39.430] a
[01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.510] little
[01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.670] to
[01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.790] the
[01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:40.010] west.
[01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.610] But
[01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:42.010] we'll
[01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:42.210] face
[01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:42.330] them
[01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:42.690] south
[01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:43.030] and
[01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.210] at
[01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:43.230] a
[01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.490] latitude
[01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:43.870] tilt.
[01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:45.130] Or
[01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:45.450] we
[01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:45.590] can
[01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:45.970] decide,
[01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:46.250] no,
[01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:46.770] let's
[01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:47.110] actually
[01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:47.430] track
[01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.650] the
[01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:47.850] sun
[01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:48.150] throughout
[01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.530] the
[01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:48.850] sky
[01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:49.330] throughout
[01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:49.470] the
[01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.730] day.
[01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:50.230] And
[01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.350] so
[01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:50.490] we'll
[01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:50.770] start
[01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:50.950] in
[01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:51.030] the
[01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:51.230] east
[01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.310] in
[01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:51.410] the
[01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.610] morning
[01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:51.990] and
[01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.290] have
[01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:52.410] it
[01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:52.730] rotating
[01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.930] through
[01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:53.050] on
[01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:53.170] one
[01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:53.410] axis
[01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:53.830] tracker
[01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:54.350] throughout
[01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:54.490] the
[01:00:54.490 --> 01:00:54.650] day.
[01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:55.090] Or
[01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:55.290] we
[01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:55.410] can
[01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:55.550] have
[01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:55.630] a
[01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.790] two
[01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:56.010] axis
[01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:56.410] tracker
[01:00:56.410 --> 01:00:56.810] where
[01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:56.970] it
[01:00:56.970 --> 01:00:57.270] rotates
[01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.530] to
[01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:57.790] follow
[01:00:57.790 --> 01:00:57.990] the
[01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.150] sun
[01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.350] throughout
[01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:58.510] the
[01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.790] seasons
[01:00:58.790 --> 01:00:59.030] as
[01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.230] well,
[01:00:59.610 --> 01:00:59.710] a
[01:00:59.710 --> 01:00:59.790] kind
[01:00:59.790 --> 01:00:59.870] of
[01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.970] a

[01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.390]-south
[01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.650] tilt.
[01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:01.030] And
[01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.590] that's
[01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:01.770] what's
[01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:02.010] plotted
[01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:02.250] right
[01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:02.450] here.
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.730] This
[01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:04.050] is
[01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:04.470] a
[01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.750] quick
[01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.150] approximation
[01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:07.630] of

[01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:09.690] axis
[01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:09.910] and
[01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:10.050] two
[01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:10.310] axis
[01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:10.830] trackers
[01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:11.030] for
[01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.130] a

[01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:12.130] Boston
[01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:12.910] using
[01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:13.230] a
[01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.550] simulation
[01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:13.890] tool
[01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:14.150] called
[01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.770] PVWatts.
[01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:15.050] There's
[01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:15.150] a
[01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.330] link
[01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:15.670] to
[01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.910] that.
[01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:16.650] It's
[01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:17.390] based
[01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.550] on

[01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:19.730] There's
[01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:19.810] a
[01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:19.930] link
[01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:20.090] to
[01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:20.250] that
[01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:20.350] at
[01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:20.450] the

[01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.350] slides.
[01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:22.030] But
[01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:22.190] this
[01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.410] shows
[01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:22.650] you
[01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:23.110] the
[01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:23.430] total
[01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.770] system
[01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:24.070] output
[01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:24.270] in
[01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.450] terms
[01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:24.590] of
[01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:24.830] kilowatt
[01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:25.150] hours
[01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.910] in
[01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:26.110] terms
[01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:26.350] of
[01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:26.790] hours
[01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:26.990] per
[01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.250] day.
[01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:27.890] I
[01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:29.150] think,
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:29.980] yeah,
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:30.100] it's
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:30.200] a
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:30.300] little
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:30.420] bit
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:30.500] of
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:30.580] an

[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.140] units
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:31.340] there
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:31.460] on
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:31.580] the
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:31.700] y
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:31.860]-axis.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.080] But
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:32.760] it
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.040] shows
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:33.220] you
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:33.640] the
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.740] relative
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.100] gain
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:35.240] that
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:35.340] you
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:35.460] would
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:35.620] get
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:35.800] by
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.020] going
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:36.160] to
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:36.280] a
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:36.420] one
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:36.660] axis
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:36.860] and
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:36.980] then
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.180] finally
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:37.300] a
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:37.440] two
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:37.660] axis
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.040] tracker.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:38.780] So

[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:39.820] it
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:40.020] makes
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:40.220] sense
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:40.360] to

[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.140] since
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:42.520] especially
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:42.720] you
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.060] broaden
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:43.340] out
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:43.580] the
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:43.900] peak
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:44.360] near

[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:45.840] day.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:45.980] And
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:46.240] that's
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:46.800] really
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.080] good.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.360] But
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:48.760] not
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.000] always
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:49.160] does
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:49.260] it
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:49.380] make
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:49.640] sense
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.020] financially
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.240] to
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:50.380] go
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:50.480] to
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:50.560] a

[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.200] tracker.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:51.400] You're
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:51.540] adding
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:51.800] another

[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.200] onto
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:52.380] that
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:52.660] thing.
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:53.120] It's
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:53.300] really
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:53.480] not
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:53.680] gaining
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:53.820] you
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:53.980] that
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:54.260] much.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:55.520] Obviously,
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:55.720] you
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:55.860] have
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:56.000] to
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:56.320] calculate
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:56.500] it
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:56.700] out
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:57.440] yourself
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:57.740] for

[01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:58.800] location.
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:01:59.040] But
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:01:59.240] by
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:01:59.340] and
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:01:59.540] large,
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:01:59.760] a

[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:01.560] makes
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:01.820] sense
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:01.980] for
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:02.080] a

[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:02.520] panel.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:03.460] Now,
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:03.580] if
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:03.680] you
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:03.960] have
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.320] a
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:04.800] concentrator
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.240] lens
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:05.340] in
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:05.460] the
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:05.660] front
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:05.800] and
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:05.940] it
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.220] has
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:06.340] to
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:06.460] be
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:06.660] looking
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:06.980] directly
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:07.100] at
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:07.220] the
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:07.420] sun,
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:07.720] then
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:07.860] you're
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:08.000] kind
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:08.100] of
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:08.320] forced
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:08.460] to
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:08.540] go
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:08.620] to
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:08.760] two
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:08.960] axis
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.280] tracker.
[01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.950] OK,
[01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:11.290] and
[01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:11.410] there
[01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:11.510] you
[01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.670] have
[01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.790] your
[01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:11.970] total
[01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:12.270] system
[01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:12.570] output,
[01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:12.830] which
[01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:13.050] is
[01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:13.330] just
[01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:13.570] the
[01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:13.950] integral
[01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:14.170] under
[01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:14.330] the

[01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:15.670] over

[01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:16.070] entire
[01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:16.310] year.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.200] So
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:18.560] definitions,
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.060] I
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:19.180] should
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:19.260] have
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:19.360] done
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:19.480] this
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:19.820] before.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:20.040] But
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.680] direct
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.100] sunlight
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:21.480] looking
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:21.760] directly
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:21.880] at
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:21.980] the
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.160] sun
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:22.280] and
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:22.400] then
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:22.760] diffuse
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.240] sunlight
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:23.440] or
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:23.720] scattered
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.020] light
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:24.520] coming
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:24.780] off
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:24.900] of
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:25.100] other
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:25.840] things.
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:26.200] So
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:26.500] diffuse
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:26.800] sunlight
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:26.980] would
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.500] be
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.620] coming
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:28.840] from
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:28.940] the
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:29.160] other
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.060] angles
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:30.500] in
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:30.880] other
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.520] directions
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:31.680] in
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:31.800] the
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:32.060] sky.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:32.580] The
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:32.800] direct
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.140] sunlight
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:33.340] would
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:33.500] pretty
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:33.700] much
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:33.860] be
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:34.120] at
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:34.280] the
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:34.500] sun,
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:35.080] plus
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:35.220] or
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:35.400] minus
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:35.580] a
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:35.660] few
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:35.920] degrees.
[01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:37.730] And
[01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:37.870] we
[01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:38.130] have
[01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:38.430] different
[01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.650] ways
[01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:38.790] of
[01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:39.110] measuring
[01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:39.470] the

[01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:42.390] plate.
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.750] Up
[01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.870] there
[01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.990] on
[01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:43.070] the
[01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:43.230] upper
[01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.450] left,
[01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.570] it
[01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:43.690] says
[01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:43.970] flat
[01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:44.290] plate
[01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:44.630] facing
[01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:45.010] south
[01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:45.390] latitude
[01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.790] tilt.
[01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:46.210] Just
[01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:46.350] like
[01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:46.510] we
[01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.690] said,
[01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:46.870] it's
[01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:47.150] facing
[01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.490] south
[01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:47.630] in
[01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.710] the
[01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.870] United
[01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:48.210] States.
[01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:48.410] That's
[01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.610] good.
[01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.910] Latitude
[01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:50.230] tilt,
[01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:50.490] meaning
[01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:50.690] it's
[01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.890] tilted
[01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:51.090] at
[01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:51.210] our
[01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:51.510] latitude.
[01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.830] So
[01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:51.910] if
[01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.990] we
[01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.110] go
[01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:52.390] from
[01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.850] the

[01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.830] and
[01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:54.090] Texas
[01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:54.450] up
[01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:54.770] to
[01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:55.430] the

[01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:56.010] of
[01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:56.370] Minnesota,
[01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.610] we'll
[01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:57.110] be
[01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:57.750] tilting
[01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.950] it
[01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:58.570] more
[01:02:58.570 --> 01:02:58.730] and
[01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.970] more
[01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:59.950] toward
[01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:00.130] the
[01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:00.330] south,
[01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.510] like
[01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.750] this,
[01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:01.030] going
[01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:01.310] from
[01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:01.650] Texas
[01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:02.030] to
[01:03:02.030 --> 01:03:02.770] Minnesota,
[01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.130] right?
[01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.730] From
[01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:04.010] Texas
[01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.350] to
[01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:04.670] Minnesota.
[01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:06.550] And
[01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:07.070] so
[01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:07.350] latitude
[01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:07.710] tilt
[01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:08.090] facing
[01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:08.430] south,
[01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:08.730] flat
[01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:08.990] plate.
[01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:10.050] This
[01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:10.350] is
[01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:10.890] essentially
[01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:11.410] accumulating
[01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:11.830] all
[01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:11.930] of
[01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:12.050] the
[01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:12.350] sunlight,
[01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:12.730] the
[01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:12.990] direct
[01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:13.510] and
[01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.670] the
[01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.930] scattered
[01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:14.230] light,
[01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:14.770] because
[01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:14.930] it's
[01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:15.030] all
[01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:15.170] being
[01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.410] collected
[01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:15.570] by
[01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:15.690] that
[01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:15.910] flat
[01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:16.090] plate
[01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:16.270] there.
[01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.710] This
[01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:18.210] map,
[01:03:18.350 --> 01:03:18.530] on
[01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.610] the
[01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:18.750] other
[01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:19.010] hand,
[01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:19.290] is
[01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:19.450] for
[01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:19.570] a
[01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:19.730] two
[01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:20.010] axis
[01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:20.510] tracker.
[01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.770] And
[01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:21.250] it's
[01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:21.510] looking
[01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.690] at
[01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:21.850] the
[01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:22.090] sun
[01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:22.350] plus
[01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:22.510] or
[01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.710] minus
[01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.890] 2
[01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:23.110].5
[01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:23.450] degrees.
[01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.410] And
[01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.510] so
[01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.650] it's
[01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.870] really
[01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:25.090] only
[01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:25.370] picking
[01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.650] up
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.840] this
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.100] right
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:27.320] here
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:27.460] out
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:27.520] of
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:27.640] the
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:27.840] sky.
[01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.890] And
[01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:29.030] when
[01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:29.230] it's
[01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.490] sunny
[01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:29.850] all
[01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:29.950] the
[01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:30.290] time,
[01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:30.770] you're
[01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:31.030] golden.
[01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.410] You're
[01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:31.710] tracking
[01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.950] the
[01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:32.090] sun.
[01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.250] You're
[01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:32.470] actually
[01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:33.190] getting
[01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.450] more
[01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:33.750] energy
[01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.390] than
[01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.510] you
[01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.690] would
[01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:34.810] if
[01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:34.910] you
[01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:35.070] just
[01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:35.170] had
[01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:35.270] a

[01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.730] plate,
[01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:36.410] because
[01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:36.610] the
[01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:36.810] cosine
[01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:37.130] theta
[01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:37.410] angle
[01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:37.590] is
[01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:37.890] changing
[01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:38.110] throughout
[01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:38.270] the
[01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.430] day
[01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.530] if
[01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:38.590] you
[01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:38.690] have
[01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:38.770] a
[01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:38.930] flat
[01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:39.190] plate.
[01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:39.930] When
[01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:40.050] the
[01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:40.190] sun
[01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.290] is
[01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:40.390] in
[01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.470] the
[01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.630] morning
[01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.890] time,
[01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.990] you
[01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.070] have
[01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:41.130] a

[01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.690] like
[01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:42.030] this.
[01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:42.770] So
[01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:42.990] if
[01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:43.730] my
[01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:43.930] sunlight
[01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:44.110] is

[01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:44.930] this
[01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:45.050] and
[01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:45.150] I
[01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.350] do
[01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:46.030] cosine
[01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:46.350] theta
[01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:46.490] of

[01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:46.790] angle,
[01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:47.070] I'm
[01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:47.330] only
[01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:47.490] getting
[01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:47.590] a
[01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:47.690] very
[01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:48.050] small

[01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.510] of

[01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:50.510] projected
[01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.910] onto
[01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:51.150] this
[01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.370] plate
[01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:51.570] right
[01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:51.790] here.
[01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:52.470] Whereas
[01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.550] in
[01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:52.650] the
[01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:52.750] middle

[01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.370] now

[01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:54.070] theta
[01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:54.250] is
[01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:54.550] 1.
[01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:55.050] I
[01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:55.210] get
[01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:55.510] the

[01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.950] sunlight.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:57.120] But
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:57.300] if
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:57.420] I
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:57.680] have,

[01:03:59.580 --> 01:03:59.800] I
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:03:59.880] would
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:03:59.960] be
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:00.080] able
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:00.260] to

[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:02.580] east
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:02.900] and
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:03.000] then
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:03.200] track
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:03.300] it
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:03.440] throughout
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:03.560] the
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:03.760] day.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:04.240] And
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:04.440] that's
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:04.540] where
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:04.760] I'd
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:04.960] get
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.360] this
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:05.880] additional
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.660] energy
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:07.000] boost
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:07.200] here
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:07.320] in
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:07.420] the
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:07.740] mornings,
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:08.260] right
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.020] there,
[01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:10.090] from

[01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:11.150] system.
[01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:11.890] So
[01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:11.990] if
[01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.070] I
[01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:12.170] have

[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:17.900] And
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:18.020] if
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:18.160] I'm
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:18.320] only
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:18.540] looking

[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:21.220] this
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:21.520] little

[01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.470] If
[01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.570] I
[01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:28.670] have
[01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.750] a

[01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.310] I
[01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:29.510] win.
[01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:30.030] If
[01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:30.150] I
[01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.270] have

[01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:33.870] And
[01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:33.970] so
[01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:34.210] that's
[01:04:34.210 --> 01:04:34.450] why
[01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:34.650] in

[01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:37.210] cloudy,
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:38.560] I
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:38.700] won't

[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:39.420] in
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:39.760] particular,
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.400] it's
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:41.720] actually
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:42.540] better
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:42.760] for

[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:47.560] we
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:47.860] have
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:48.440] a
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:48.560] lot
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:48.680] of
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:48.900] sunny
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.240] days,
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:50.160] you
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:50.380] start
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:50.680] having
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:50.940] two

[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.080] sense.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:53.040] And
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:53.140] it's
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:53.280] just
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:53.540] really
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:53.720] the
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.000] ratio
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:54.180] of
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:54.320] these
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:54.480] two
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:54.780] maps.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:55.440] This
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:55.640] one,
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:55.800] which
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:55.940] is
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:56.160] flat
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:56.460] plate,
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.000] and
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:57.160] that
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:57.320] one,
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:57.480] which
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:57.640] is
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.060] concentrator.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:58.640] You
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:58.780] see
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:04:58.960] over
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.300] here,
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.180] we
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:00.480] win
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:00.760] if
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:00.880] we
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.040] go
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:01.260] for
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:01.400] the
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:01.900] concentrator.
[01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:03.230] And
[01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.410] over
[01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.770] here,
[01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:04.750] we
[01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:05.410] get
[01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:05.630] more
[01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.890] energy
[01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.330] out
[01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:07.630] if
[01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.850] we
[01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:08.410] use
[01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:08.630] the
[01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.810] flat
[01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:09.090] plate.
[01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:10.170] Now
[01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:10.330] that's
[01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:10.510] just
[01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.870] energy.
[01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:11.950] Obviously,
[01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:12.350] costs
[01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:12.470] and
[01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.950] economics
[01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:13.930] factors
[01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:14.170] in
[01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:14.330] what
[01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:14.870] it
[01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:15.050] takes
[01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:15.210] to
[01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:15.470] install
[01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.650] it.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.080] OK.
[01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:20.450] And
[01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.970] weather
[01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:21.290] patterns.
[01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:21.470] I
[01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.670] promised
[01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.850] I'd
[01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:21.950] get
[01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:22.150] back
[01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.270] to
[01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:22.490] this.
[01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:24.030] Interesting
[01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:24.310] to
[01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:24.550] note

[01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.630] And

[01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.390] are

[01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:42.670] have
[01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:43.010] these
[01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.770] beautiful
[01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:44.890] tropical
[01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:45.490] forests.
[01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:46.010] And
[01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.310] those
[01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:46.710] are,
[01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:48.070] obviously,
[01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:48.470] the
[01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.630] high
[01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.870] cloud
[01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:49.150] cover
[01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.250] in
[01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:49.390] those
[01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:49.710] regions
[01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:50.310] is
[01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:50.670] blocking
[01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:50.850] out
[01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:51.010] some
[01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:51.090] of
[01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:51.190] the
[01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.370] sun.
[01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:52.090] And
[01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:52.350] likewise,
[01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.550] you
[01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:52.670] can
[01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.870] see
[01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:53.010] that
[01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:53.450] dichotomy
[01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.830] between
[01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:54.150] Phoenix
[01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.290] and
[01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:54.650] Atlanta,
[01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:55.170] same
[01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:55.450] latitude
[01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:55.810] again,
[01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.350] but
[01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:56.630] Atlanta
[01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.950] having
[01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:57.070] a
[01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:57.210] higher
[01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:57.550] cloud
[01:05:57.550 --> 01:05:57.950] coverage
[01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:58.350] than
[01:05:58.350 --> 01:05:58.650] Phoenix,
[01:05:58.770 --> 01:05:58.850] and
[01:05:58.850 --> 01:05:59.050] hence,
[01:05:59.410 --> 01:05:59.550] a
[01:05:59.550 --> 01:05:59.790] lower
[01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:00.350] solar
[01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:00.770] resource,
[01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:01.030] a
[01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:01.250] lower
[01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.870] insulation.
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:03.360] So
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:03.460] you
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:03.560] see
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:03.680] how
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:03.900] this
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:04.200] kind
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:04.300] of
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:04.520] ties
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:04.840] together.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:05.520] That's
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:05.660] all
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:06.060] predictable,
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:06.540] in
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:06.640] a
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:06.820] sense.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:07.480] This
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:07.660] is
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.160] unpredictable
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.280] at
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:09.420] a
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:09.620] local
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:09.940] level
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:10.500] for
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:10.780] one
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:11.140] system.
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:11.940] If
[01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.100] the
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:12.360] sun
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.280] is
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:13.700] tracing
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:13.860] its
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:13.980] route
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:14.120] through
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:14.260] the
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:14.460] sky
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:14.560] and
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:14.660] you
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:14.820] have
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.000] that
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:15.320] envelope
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:15.820] function
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.340] that
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:16.520] you've
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:16.640] just
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:16.840] spent
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.080] so
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:17.220] much
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:17.500] effort
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:17.940] calculating
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:18.180] out
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:18.320] with
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:18.440] all
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:18.580] your
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:18.760] trig
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.200] functions
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:19.520] and
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:19.640] the
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:19.860] computer
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:20.340] simulation,
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:20.640] the
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:20.820] code
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:20.940] that
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:21.200] you've
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:21.620] just
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:21.780] been
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:21.920] given
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.200] here,
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:22.860] and
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.000] now
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:23.140] a
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:23.340] cloud
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:23.620] comes
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:23.800] over,
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.000] some
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:24.340] random
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:24.700] cloud
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:24.840] that
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:24.960] was
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.160] very
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:25.360] hard
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:25.520] to
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:25.780] predict.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:26.240] And
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:26.380] you
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:26.540] just
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:26.660] have
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:26.840] one
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.120] panel,
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:27.540] one
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:27.760] tiny
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:27.940] little
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.140] thing
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:28.300] like
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:28.600] this.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.120] And
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:29.220] the
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:29.380] cloud
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:29.580] goes
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:29.800] over
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:29.940] it.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:30.360] Boom,
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:30.580] all
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:30.640] of
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:30.780] a
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:30.800] sudden,
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:30.920] you
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.060] get
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:31.160] a
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:31.360] drop
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:31.480] in
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.020] your
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:32.640] instantaneous
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.580] power
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:33.880] output.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:34.560] Boom,
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:34.960] drops
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.220] again.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:35.540] Another
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:35.820] cloud,
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:36.120] drops
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:36.380] again.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:36.920] And
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.120] then
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:37.720] a
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.000] thunderstorm
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:38.180] in
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:38.260] the
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:38.480] afternoon.
[01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:40.130] So
[01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.530] a
[01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:41.090] meteorologist
[01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:41.350] could
[01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:41.450] have
[01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.650] told
[01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:41.790] you
[01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:41.950] that
[01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:42.150] this
[01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.510] thunderstorm
[01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:42.790] was
[01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:43.050] coming.
[01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:43.810] But
[01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:44.330] a
[01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:44.810] meteorologist
[01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:44.930] would
[01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:45.050] be
[01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:45.270] hard
[01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.530]-pressed
[01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:45.910] to
[01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:46.530] be
[01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:46.650] able
[01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:46.770] to
[01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:47.130] predict
[01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:47.490] the
[01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:48.010] evolution
[01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:48.190] of
[01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.290] a
[01:06:48.290 --> 01:06:48.450] tiny
[01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:48.670] little
[01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.990] cloud
[01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.570] over
[01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:49.730] your
[01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.990] system.
[01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:50.770] And
[01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:51.050] so
[01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:51.790] the
[01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:52.190] question
[01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.550] is,
[01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:52.850] to
[01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:53.030] what
[01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:53.310] degree
[01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:53.450] are
[01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:53.630] these
[01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:54.510] local
[01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.770] weather
[01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:55.090] patterns
[01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:55.510] predictable
[01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.730] and
[01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:56.150] unpredictable?
[01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.770] And
[01:06:56.770 --> 01:06:57.150] hopefully,
[01:06:57.570 --> 01:06:58.070] some
[01:06:58.070 --> 01:06:58.230] of
[01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.370] you
[01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.630] over
[01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:59.090] this
[01:06:59.090 --> 01:06:59.790] class
[01:06:59.790 --> 01:06:59.970] will
[01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:00.070] be
[01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:00.170] able
[01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.330] to
[01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:00.650] help
[01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:00.970] answer
[01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:01.150] that
[01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.530] question
[01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:02.370] by
[01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:02.790] analyzing
[01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:03.150] data
[01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.470] from
[01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.770] tens
[01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:03.930] of
[01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:04.170] thousands
[01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:04.430] of
[01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.710] systems

[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:31.640] right
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:31.820] now
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:31.980] because
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:32.160] neither
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:32.320] my
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:32.500] wife

[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:32.700] I
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:32.760] are
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:32.780] at
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:33.000] home.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:33.680] And
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:33.840] they're
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.220] injecting
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:34.340] that
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:34.540] power
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:34.700] into
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:34.840] the
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.000] grid.
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:35.100] And
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:35.220] the
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:35.360] grid
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:35.520] is
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:35.760] serving
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:35.940] as
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:36.040] our
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:36.200] big

[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:37.200] as

[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:37.840] unit.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.660] And
[01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:39.990] I'm
[01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.630] riding
[01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.990] free.
[01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.250] I'm
[01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:41.350] a

[01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.750] rider
[01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:41.970] right
[01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:42.130] now.
[01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:42.550] I
[01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.730] don't
[01:08:42.730 --> 01:08:42.890] pay
[01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:43.050] for
[01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:43.250] that
[01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:43.690] service,
[01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:44.210] necessarily.
[01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.650] I
[01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:44.790] do
[01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:44.910] the

[01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.210] star.
[01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.970] But
[01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:47.450] they're
[01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.570] not
[01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:47.870] charging
[01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:48.030] me
[01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.310] extra
[01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:48.810] for
[01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:49.710] the
[01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:50.090] service
[01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.710] of
[01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:52.210] using
[01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:52.370] the
[01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:52.510] grid
[01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:52.630] as

[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:55.980] Another
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:56.260] thing
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:56.360] to
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:56.500] keep
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:56.620] in
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:56.860] mind
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:57.140] is
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:57.320] that
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:57.720] we're
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.220] calculating
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:58.520] all

[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:01.880] and
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.300] scientific
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:02.820] principles.
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:03.200] We're
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:03.620] calculating
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:03.840] the
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.040] solar
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:04.460] resource,
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:04.720] which
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:04.920] is
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.320] a
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:05.540] good,
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:05.900] important
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.200] first
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:06.480] step.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:07.500] Now,
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:07.740] if
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:07.880] we
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.080] look
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:08.180] at
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:08.300] the

[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:11.800] this

[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:13.200] But
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:13.480] follow
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:13.640] me
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:13.740] on

[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:21.460] We'll
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:21.660] see
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:21.940] that

[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:27.840] And
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.140] yet,
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:28.840] if
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:28.940] we
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:29.080] look
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:29.180] at
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:29.300] the

[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:34.960] going

[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.260] per
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:38.460] year,
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.020] we
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:39.140] can
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:39.340] see
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:39.600] that
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:39.940] there's
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:40.140] a
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:40.280] lot
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:40.480] more
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:40.740] sun
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:40.880] in

[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:41.380] States
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:41.500] than
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:41.580] there
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:41.660] is
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:41.780] in
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:41.980] Germany.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:42.800] So
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.100] there's
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:43.520] something
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:43.920] else
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.180] going
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:44.520] on
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:44.660] than
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:45.060] just
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:45.420] the

[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.040] resource.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:46.580] And
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:46.800] that's
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:46.900] the
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:47.320] economics.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.080] That's
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:48.200] why
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:48.340] we
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:48.540] talk
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:48.740] about
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:48.900] the
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:49.200] policy
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:49.340] and

[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:49.940] later
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:50.080] on
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:50.200] in
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:50.480] class.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:51.000] That's
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:51.080] why
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:51.200] we
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:51.540] dedicate
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:52.060] a
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:52.360] sizable
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:52.720] portion
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.320] later
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:53.520] on
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:53.760] talking
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:53.980] about
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:54.220] that.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:55.620] Lastly,
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:56.060] our
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:56.840] final

[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:57.460] objective
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:57.860] before
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:58.340] we
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.100] halt
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:09:59.320] for
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:09:59.840] questions
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.120] and
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:00.360] for
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.240] comments,
[01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.290] we
[01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:02.450] need
[01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.550] to
[01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.810] estimate
[01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:03.010] the
[01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:03.230] land
[01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:03.450] area
[01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:03.670] needed
[01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:03.750] to
[01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:04.070] provide
[01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.670] sufficient
[01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:04.970] solar
[01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:05.370] resource
[01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:05.550] for
[01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.650] a
[01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:06.010] project.
[01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:06.670] And
[01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:06.810] this
[01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:06.930] is
[01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:07.090] really
[01:10:07.090 --> 01:10:07.230] where
[01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:07.390] your
[01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.630] homework
[01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.910] picks
[01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:08.090] up,
[01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:08.190] and
[01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:08.310] we'll
[01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.510] spend
[01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.710] some
[01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:08.870] time
[01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.990] in
[01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.470] recitation
[01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.850] walking
[01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:10.110] through
[01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.390] this.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.120] But
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:12.520] it's
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:12.840] important
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.060] to
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:13.200] get
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:13.420] your
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:13.740] units
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.080] right.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:14.880] And
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.000] so
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:15.080] I
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.180] want
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:15.260] to
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:15.360] do
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:15.500] a
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:15.780] quick
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:16.320] quiz
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:16.560] right
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:16.880] now.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:18.640] Think
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:18.780] in
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:18.920] your
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.320] minds
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:19.860] which
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:20.060] of
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:20.880] these
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.900] properties
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:23.820] corresponds
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.220] to
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:24.420] which
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:24.700] units,
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:24.800] or
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:24.900] are
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.280] described
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:25.480] by
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:25.700] which
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:26.000] units
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:26.180] over
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:26.360] here
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:26.460] on
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:26.560] the
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:26.740] right.
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:27.280] So
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:27.600] do
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:27.800] kind
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:27.880] of
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.040] a
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:28.280] linkage
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:28.540] in
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:28.640] your
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:28.940] mind,
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:29.200] one
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:29.320] to
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:29.600] one,
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:29.980] connect,
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:30.180] connect,
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:30.400] connect,
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:30.660] connect,
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:31.360] without
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:31.680] looking
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:31.860] at
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:32.100] your
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:32.740] slides.
[01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.770] And
[01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:34.890] then
[01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:35.010] we'll
[01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:35.150] do
[01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:35.310] it
[01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:35.490] in
[01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:35.810] three,
[01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.350] two,
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:39.160] one.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:40.900] Those
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:40.980] are
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:41.120] your
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:41.440] answers.
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:42.300] So
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:42.880] the
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:43.200] ones
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:43.360] that
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:43.680] usually
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:43.940] get
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:44.400] confused
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:44.620] are
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:44.920] power
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.060] and
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:45.420] energy,
[01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:47.170] kilowatts
[01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:47.310] and
[01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.650] kilowatt
[01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:48.050] hours.
[01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.590] The
[01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:50.910] way
[01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:51.030] to
[01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.290] remember
[01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.470] it,
[01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.730] the
[01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:51.950] easiest
[01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:52.110] way
[01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:52.190] to
[01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:52.390] remember
[01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.710] it,
[01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:52.950] would
[01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:53.130] be
[01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:53.270] to
[01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.530] remember
[01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:53.910] that
[01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:54.610] the
[01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:54.890] power
[01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:55.170] time
[01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:55.550] product
[01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:56.150] is
[01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:56.330] equal
[01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:56.450] to
[01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.710] energy.
[01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:57.310] So
[01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.430] if
[01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.490] you
[01:10:57.490 --> 01:10:57.610] have
[01:10:57.610 --> 01:10:57.990] power
[01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.590] instantaneous
[01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:59.210] energy
[01:10:59.210 --> 01:10:59.510] burn
[01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.710] rate
[01:10:59.710 --> 01:10:59.990] versus
[01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.470] time,
[01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:01.090] some
[01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:01.390] plot
[01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.530] that
[01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:01.670] looks
[01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:01.830] like
[01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.990] this.
[01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:02.150] You
[01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:02.330] take
[01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:02.470] the
[01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.710] integral
[01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:02.870] of
[01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:03.010] that
[01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:03.350] curve,
[01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.930] that's
[01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:04.050] your
[01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:04.230] total
[01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:04.490] energy.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:06.600] So
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.040] in
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:07.300] terms
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:07.620] of
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:08.100] units,
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.160] current,
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:09.460] voltage,
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:09.700] power,
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:09.800] and
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:10.060] energy,
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:11.340] a
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:11.780] hairdryer
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:12.000] versus
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:12.240] a
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:12.560] fridge,
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:13.300] which
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:13.460] is
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:13.640] more
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:13.900] likely
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:14.080] to
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:14.240] blow
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:14.380] a
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:14.760] fuse,
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.080] and
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:15.260] which
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:15.400] is
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:15.560] more
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:15.760] likely
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:15.920] to
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.040] blow
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:16.200] your
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:16.500] budget?
[01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.050] Hairdryer's
[01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:21.190] more
[01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:21.350] likely
[01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.510] to
[01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.630] blow
[01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.770] a
[01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.950] fuse.
[01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:22.130] Why
[01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.230] is
[01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:22.450] that?
[01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.850] Yeah,
[01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:25.390] high
[01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:26.670] current,
[01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:26.970] really,
[01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.210] because
[01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:27.550] everything's
[01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:27.710] running
[01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:28.050] 120.
[01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.710] It's
[01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:28.810] a
[01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:28.950] higher
[01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:29.390] current.
[01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:29.810] It's
[01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:30.110] pushing
[01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.530] the
[01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:30.930] wattage
[01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:31.090] up
[01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:31.230] to
[01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:31.490] around
[01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.830] 1
[01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:33.950],500,
[01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:34.390] 1
[01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.810],700
[01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:35.270] watts.
[01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:38.010] And
[01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:38.410] so
[01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:38.570] it's
[01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.770] running
[01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:39.070] close
[01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.210] to
[01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:39.310] the
[01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.570] 15
[01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:39.710]-amp
[01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:39.970] limit.
[01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.790] And
[01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:41.170] the
[01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:41.370] fridge,
[01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.470] on
[01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.570] the
[01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.670] other
[01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:41.850] hand,
[01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:42.070] is
[01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.850] probably
[01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:43.230] an
[01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:43.350] order
[01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.450] of
[01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:43.710] magnitude
[01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:44.030] lower.
[01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.550] But
[01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.710] the
[01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:44.850] fridge
[01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:44.990] is
[01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.170] running
[01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:45.330] all
[01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:45.450] the
[01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:45.790] time,
[01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:46.050] and
[01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:46.170] your
[01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:46.590] hairdryer's
[01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.730] only
[01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:46.970] running
[01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:47.090] a
[01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:47.310] few
[01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:47.770] minutes
[01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:47.910] a
[01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:48.070] day.
[01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:48.970] So
[01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:49.470] in
[01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:49.590] terms
[01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.710] of
[01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:49.870] blowing
[01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:50.030] a
[01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.270] fuse,
[01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:50.570] it
[01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.810] uses
[01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:51.050] a
[01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.210] large
[01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:51.370] amount
[01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:51.490] of
[01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:51.730] power
[01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:51.930] for
[01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:51.990] a
[01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.130] very
[01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.370] short
[01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:52.510] amount
[01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.650] of
[01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:53.010] time,
[01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:53.750] whereas
[01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.990] the
[01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.290] fridge
[01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.850] uses
[01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:54.990] a
[01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.230] smaller
[01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:55.410] amount
[01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:55.510] of
[01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.690] power
[01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:55.890] for
[01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:56.030] a
[01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.230] longer
[01:11:56.230 --> 01:11:56.410] amount
[01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:56.530] of
[01:11:56.530 --> 01:11:56.790] time.
[01:11:57.090 --> 01:11:57.270] And
[01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.390] the
[01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:57.650] integral
[01:11:57.650 --> 01:11:57.870] under
[01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:58.170] that
[01:11:58.170 --> 01:11:58.550] curve
[01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:59.150] winds
[01:11:59.150 --> 01:11:59.290] up
[01:11:59.290 --> 01:11:59.470] being
[01:11:59.470 --> 01:11:59.790] more,
[01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:00.190] typically,
[01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.750] than
[01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.870] your
[01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:01.510] hairdryer.
[01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:02.130] That's
[01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:02.210] the
[01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:02.330] total
[01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.490] amount
[01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:02.590] of
[01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.870] energy.
[01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:03.870] And
[01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:04.030] you
[01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.310] pay
[01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.670] by
[01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:04.790] the
[01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:05.010] energy.
[01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:05.130] You
[01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:05.350] pay
[01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.510] by
[01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.650] the
[01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:05.890] kilowatt
[01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:06.110] hour
[01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.630] to
[01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.870] your

[01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.770] company.
[01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:07.890] And
[01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:08.030] that's
[01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.130] why
[01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:08.210] it
[01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:08.290] would
[01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:08.430] blow
[01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:08.550] your
[01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.750] budget.
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:10.780] Yep,
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.160] oopsie.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:11.420] So
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:11.540] the
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:11.800] numbers
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.080] work
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:12.260] out
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:12.400] to
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:12.600] somewhere
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:12.820] around

[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:13.420] hour
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:13.560] per
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:13.760] day
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:13.920] for
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.220] the
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:14.560] fridge
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:14.760] and
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.020] about
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:15.260] half
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:15.360] a
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:15.540] kilowatt
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:15.700] hour
[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:15.820] a
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:15.920] day
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.160] for
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:16.300] the
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:16.760] hairdryer.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:17.260] A
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:17.480] kilowatt
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:17.680] hour
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:17.880] is
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.040] how
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:18.240] much
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:18.400] in
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.020] here?
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:20.180] $0
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:20.180].18?
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:21.040] Most
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:21.240] people
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:21.400] pay
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:21.540] about

[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:21.860].18
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:22.180] per

[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:22.640] hour.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:23.140] And
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:23.240] so
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:23.340] you
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:23.440] can
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:23.760] calculate
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:23.980] how
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:24.140] much
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:24.280] it
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:24.640] costs
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:24.840] to
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:24.980] keep
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:25.200] things
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:25.380] running
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:25.540] in
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:25.640] your
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:25.840] house.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:26.920] Most
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.040] of
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:27.140] us
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:27.300] don't
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:27.500] usually
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:27.740] think
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:27.920] about
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.140] that.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.080] And
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:30.440] last,
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:30.700] last,

[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:40.720] we
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:40.980] take
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:41.160] a
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:41.440] panel
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:41.980] and
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:42.120] we
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:42.320] say
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:42.500] that

[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:19.460] You

[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:21.960] case
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.080] it's

[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:27.560] maybe

[01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:29.830] And
[01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:30.070] so
[01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.370] it
[01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:30.630] doesn't
[01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:30.850] want

[01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.890] It's
[01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:33.010] not
[01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:33.130] going
[01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:33.230] to
[01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:33.550] guarantee
[01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:33.870] that
[01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:34.010] you're
[01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:34.070] going
[01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.130] to
[01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.250] get

[01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.590] off
[01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.670] of
[01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:35.770] the
[01:13:35.770 --> 01:13:36.010] panel.
[01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:36.730] But
[01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:36.870] it'll
[01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:37.170] guarantee
[01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:37.490] that
[01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.650] the
[01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:37.850] panel
[01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:38.050] was
[01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:38.310] rated
[01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.470] at
[01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.530] a
[01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:38.770] maximum
[01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:39.210] power
[01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:39.450] of
[01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:39.670] such
[01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:39.810] and
[01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:40.050] such
[01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:40.550] under

[01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.350] testing
[01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.770] conditions.
[01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:42.630] Now,
[01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:42.830] that's
[01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:43.070] good
[01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.350] because
[01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.530] you
[01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:43.670] can
[01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:44.170] generalize
[01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:44.310] it,
[01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:44.550] which
[01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.670] you'll
[01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:44.790] do
[01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.910] for
[01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:45.050] your
[01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.390] homework.
[01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.770] But
[01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:46.810] it
[01:13:46.810 --> 01:13:46.950] also
[01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:47.070] has
[01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.170] a
[01:13:47.170 --> 01:13:47.530] downside
[01:13:47.530 --> 01:13:48.790] because
[01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:49.410] standard

[01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:50.170] conditions

[01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:51.910] The

[01:13:54.850 --> 01:13:55.010] The

[01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:55.450] isn't

[01:13:57.670 --> 01:13:58.030] And
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:58.780] so
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:13:58.980] the

[01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.830] will
[01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:11.290] give

[01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.950] there's

[01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:15.530] to
[01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:15.630] be
[01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:15.790] made
[01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.930] there.
[01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.950] If
[01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:17.090] you
[01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.610] understand
[01:14:17.610 --> 01:14:18.370] really
[01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:18.670] well
[01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:18.930] how
[01:14:18.930 --> 01:14:19.150] much
[01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:19.430] a
[01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.870] given
[01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:20.170] panel
[01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:20.350] will
[01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.750] output,
[01:14:20.970 --> 01:14:21.310] you
[01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.470] can
[01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.730] then
[01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:22.150] predict
[01:14:22.150 --> 01:14:22.470] to
[01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.570] a
[01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:22.710] much
[01:14:22.710 --> 01:14:23.110] finer
[01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.490] degree
[01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:24.230] what
[01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:24.390] you
[01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.510] should
[01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.670] be
[01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:24.990] charging
[01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:25.210] your
[01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:25.570] customer
[01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:26.070] for
[01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.470] installing
[01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.830] panels
[01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.930] in
[01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:27.050] a
[01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:27.370] particular
[01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:27.870] location.
[01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.610] So
[01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:29.830] there's
[01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.930] a
[01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:30.070] lot
[01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.170] of
[01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:30.330] work
[01:14:30.330 --> 01:14:30.490] being
[01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:30.650] done
[01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:30.810] right
[01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:31.010] now,
[01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.210] more
[01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:31.330] on
[01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:31.450] the
[01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:31.690] business
[01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:32.010] side
[01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:32.210] of
[01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:33.450] pulling
[01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:33.730] the
[01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:34.010] systems
[01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.470] engineers
[01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.910] along
[01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:35.030] and
[01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.170] trying
[01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:35.370] to
[01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:35.710] increase
[01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:35.910] the
[01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:36.230] accuracy
[01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:36.430] of
[01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:36.770] predictions.
[01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.630] And
[01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:37.710] so
[01:14:37.710 --> 01:14:37.850] with
[01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:38.110] that,
[01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:38.490] I
[01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:38.810] will
[01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:40.050] leave
[01:14:40.050 --> 01:14:40.350] off
[01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:41.130] on
[01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:41.290] this
[01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:41.610] slide.
[01:14:41.730 --> 01:14:41.890] We
[01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:42.010] can
[01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:42.150] get
[01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:42.270] to
[01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.390] it
[01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.570] during
[01:14:42.570 --> 01:14:43.010] recitation
[01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.350] tomorrow
[01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.510] at
[01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.770] 4.
[01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:44.290] I
[01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:44.530] welcome
[01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:44.710] your

[01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:45.270] at
[01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.390] the
[01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:45.550] front
[01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.710] if
[01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:45.810] you
[01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:45.970] have
[01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:46.150] any.
