[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.920] which
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.200] is
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.920] collecting
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.380] light
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.780] through
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.080] a

[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.200] hole
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.800] that's
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.080] made
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.300] into
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.520] the

[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.560] and
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.780] that
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.000] gives
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.340] rise
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.660] to

[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.220] wall
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.180] and
[00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.730] then
[00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.290] all
[00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.430] the
[00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.690] way
[00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.190] until
[00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.570] the

[00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.550] to
[00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.850] life.
[00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.930] So
[00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.150] here's
[00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.250] an

[00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.550] obscura
[00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.510] where
[00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.270] an
[00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.550] entirely
[00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.930] dark
[00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.330] room
[00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.730] is
[00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.390] illuminated
[00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.950] by
[00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.370] the
[00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.730] light
[00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.150] that
[00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.330] is
[00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.830] passing
[00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.290] through
[00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.630] this
[00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.550] tiny
[00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.810] little
[00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.150] hole
[00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.090] and
[00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.710] creating
[00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.050] an
[00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.410] image
[00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.530] of
[00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.450] the
[00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.470] objects
[00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.170] outside,
[00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.370] of
[00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.490] the
[00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.810] scene
[00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.650] outside,
[00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.590] upside
[00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.110] down
[00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.810] in
[00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.410] this
[00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.450] very
[00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.730] dark
[00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.010] room.
[00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.610] Of
[00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.850] course
[00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.410] because
[00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.710] the
[00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.950] aperture
[00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.130] is
[00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.290] so
[00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.610] small
[00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.770] and
[00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.970] there's
[00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.090] so
[00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.290] little
[00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.590] light
[00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.930] coming
[00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.230] into
[00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.430] the
[00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.730] room
[00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.610] you
[00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.890] have
[00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.350] to,
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.260] you
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.360] know,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.480] you
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.640] have
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.780] to
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.080] adapt
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.340] to
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.660] the
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.260] darkness
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.520] of
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.720] that
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.980] room
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.140] if
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.300] you're
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.640] standing
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.980] inside
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.220] that
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.380] room
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.540] to
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.820] actually
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.260] perceive
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.760] something.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.020] It's
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.240] actually
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.520] just
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.020] very
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.260] little
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.580] light.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.760] It's
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.900] not
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.060] very
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.480] bright
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.200] if
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.340] you
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.660] create
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.940] such
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.200] a

[00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.030] But
[00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.170] this
[00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.330] has
[00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.510] been
[00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.930] used,
[00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.750] you
[00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.890] can
[00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.130] find
[00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.330] this

[00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.930] has
[00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.130] been
[00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.350] used
[00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.570] by
[00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.930] artists.
[00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.250] Here
[00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.310] are
[00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.470] some

[00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.290] more
[00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.750] examples
[00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.130] where
[00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.670] ordinary
[00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.110] rooms
[00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.370] have
[00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.570] been
[00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.150] illuminated
[00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.550] using
[00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.790] this
[00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.210] principle
[00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.150] of
[00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.270] a

[00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.910] small
[00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.410] pinhole
[00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.790] and
[00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.070] then
[00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.470] an
[00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.650] image
[00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.850] has
[00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.990] been
[00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.310] captured
[00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.690] inside
[00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.930] that
[00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.230] room
[00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.990] with
[00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.230] a

[00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.470] time
[00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.730] and
[00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.210] giving
[00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.550] rise
[00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.990] to
[00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.010] installations
[00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.530] like
[00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.770] you
[00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.930] can
[00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.130] see
[00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.470] here
[00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.850] by
[00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.090] this
[00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.530] artist.
[00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.730] So
[00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.570] the
[00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.170] most
[00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.830] basic

[00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.210] camera
[00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.490] can
[00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.650] be
[00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.030] described
[00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.510] as
[00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.770] a
[00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.150] box
[00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.890] that
[00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.070] has
[00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.230] a
[00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.530] little
[00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.430] hole
[00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.270] inside
[00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.890] one
[00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.030] of
[00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.190] the
[00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.530] walls
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.060] and
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.740] that
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.980] hole
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.140] is
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.580] collecting
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.120] light
[00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.490] or
[00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.670] is
[00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.170] letting
[00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.830] light
[00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.230] pass
[00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.590] through
[00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.850] but
[00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.030] it's
[00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.230] letting
[00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.590] light
[00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.370] pass
[00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.750] through
[00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.750] only
[00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.730] into
[00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.910] the
[00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.430] direction
[00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.430] continuing
[00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.710] where
[00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.850] the
[00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.030] light
[00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.150] is
[00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.390] coming
[00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.730] from.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.660] So
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.760] we
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.860] have
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.960] a
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.220] point
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.500] here
[00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.790] then
[00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.970] that
[00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.230] light
[00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.670] passes
[00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.870] through
[00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.030] that
[00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.290] hole
[00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.910] and
[00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.210] because
[00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.630] light
[00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.210] travels
[00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.870] linearly
[00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.950] along
[00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.510] rays
[00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.730] that
[00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.070] light
[00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.250] is
[00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.530] hitting
[00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.530] this
[00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.270] image
[00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.810] plane,
[00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.090] the
[00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.410] sensor
[00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.730] here
[00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.970] on
[00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.110] the
[00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.370] back
[00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.370] exactly
[00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.610] at
[00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.790] one
[00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.310] location.
[00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.250] And
[00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.570] because
[00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.770] of
[00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.050] this
[00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.650] the
[00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.090] image
[00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.370] that
[00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.490] is
[00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.890] projected
[00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.250] is
[00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.570] actually
[00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.050] projected
[00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.430] upside
[00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.930] down
[00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.690] onto
[00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.890] that
[00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.150] image
[00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.530] plane
[00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.150] behind
[00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.030] this
[00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.850] little
[00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.490] hole
[00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.630] in
[00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.770] the
[00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.030] wall
[00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.550] which
[00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.690] is
[00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.850] called
[00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.010] a
[00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.210] focal
[00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.650] point
[00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.970] because
[00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.270] all
[00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.510] the
[00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.810] light
[00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.150] rays
[00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.390] that
[00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.890] pass
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.400] through
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.640] this
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.880] hole
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.120] must
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.600] pass
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.040] exactly
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.280] through
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.540] this
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.780] hole,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.060] this
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.340] focal
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.700] point.
[00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.770] However,
[00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.370] when
[00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.850] we
[00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.330] consider
[00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.850] camera
[00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.210] models
[00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.370] in
[00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.550] this
[00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.870] lecture
[00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.110] we
[00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.470] typically
[00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.910] consider
[00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.450] the
[00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.890] image
[00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:31.190] plane
[00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.390] to
[00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.730] be
[00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.290] in
[00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.790] front
[00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.750] of
[00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.130] the
[00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.370] focal
[00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.650] point
[00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.770] and
[00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.930] not
[00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.350] behind
[00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.570] the
[00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.750] focal
[00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.130] point.
[00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.830] So
[00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.250] here's
[00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.750] an
[00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.210] example
[00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.770] of,
[00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.390] despite
[00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.650] this
[00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.870] being
[00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.050] the
[00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.310] physical
[00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.690] model,
[00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.310] the
[00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.730] mathematical
[00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.250] model
[00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.530] looks
[00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.750] like
[00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.950] this
[00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.090] here
[00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.190] on
[00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.330] the
[00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.590] right.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.960] The
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.480] distance
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.760] from
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.940] the
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.160] focal
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.540] point
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.880] of
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.160] this
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.020] plane
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.460] is
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.860] the
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.160] same
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.320] as
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.440] the
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.740] distance
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.980] of
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.240] this
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.520] image
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.780] plane
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.920] to
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.100] this
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.300] focal
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.620] point
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.860] but
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.220] in
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.400] this
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.660] case
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.840] the
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.060] image
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.300] plane
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.440] is
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.580] in
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.860] front
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.000] of
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.140] the
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.360] focal
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.720] point.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.640] Now
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.120] in
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.380] this
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.780] case
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.660] the
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.920] image
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.420] of
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.880] the
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.300] 3D
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.680] object
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.120] here
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.580] is
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.820] of
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.000] the
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.180] same
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.720] size
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.080] and
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.240] the
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.420] same
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.840] shape
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.100] as
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.320] the
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.660] image
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.820] if
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.980] it's
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.320] projected
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.820] behind
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.060] the
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.220] focal
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.640] point.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.020] The
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.220] only
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.560] difference
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.760] is
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.960] that
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.160] it's
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.540] mirrored.
[00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.180] And
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.980] so
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.300] both
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.700] models
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:16.940] are
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.340] actually
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.860] equivalent.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.460] They
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.620] are
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.980] just
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.680] related
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.120] by
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.720] this
[00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.310] mirroring
[00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.050] so
[00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.210] they
[00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.430] can
[00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.690] be
[00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.650] brought
[00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.990] into
[00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.190] each
[00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.450] other
[00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.110] using
[00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.530] appropriate
[00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.930] change
[00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.170] of
[00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.430] image
[00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.910] coordinates.
[00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.170] Now
[00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.410] in
[00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.570] this
[00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.770] lecture
[00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.970] we're
[00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.390] considering
[00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.830] this
[00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.270] mathematical
[00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.670] camera
[00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.050] model
[00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.590] which
[00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.790] has
[00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.160] some
[00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.510] advantages
[00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.730] in
[00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.890] the
[00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.130] sense
[00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.430] that
[00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.590] the
[00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.790] image
[00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.930] is
[00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.170] not
[00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.590] projected
[00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.910] upside
[00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.310] down
[00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.510] so
[00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.670] we
[00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.930] can
[00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.730] directly
[00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.310] see
[00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.810] the
[00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.090] image
[00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.430] as
[00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.230] we
[00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.410] would
[00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.730] see
[00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.970] it
[00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:48.590] as
[00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.010] humans
[00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.330] and
[00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.570] that's
[00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.830] also
[00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.010] how
[00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.350] digital
[00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.750] cameras
[00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.050] store
[00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.350] images.
[00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.550] They
[00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.730] don't
[00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.950] store
[00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.110] the
[00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.370] images
[00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.690] upside
[00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.090] down
[00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.490] but
[00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.670] they
[00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.930] store
[00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.250] them
[00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.810] in
[00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.930] the
[00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.170] right
[00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.790] orientation.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.820] So
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.980] this
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.200] is
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.520] what
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.640] we
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.780] can
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.120] use
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.260] as
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.360] a
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.800] replacement
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.380] for
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.620] this
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.940] model
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.300] because
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.620] both
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.780] are
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.140] equivalent
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.560] up
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.680] to
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.020] very
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.220] simple
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.060] reflection.
[00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.770] Now
[00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.010] if
[00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.110] we
[00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.310] talk
[00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.730] about
[00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.370] projection
[00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.770] models
[00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.190] there's
[00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.570] two
[00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.210] basic
[00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.750] projection
[00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.250] models
[00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.930] that
[00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.430] are
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.780] important.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.240] There's
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.460] many
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.780] more
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.060] but
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.480] these
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.680] two
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.840] are
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.980] the
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.200] ones
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.340] that
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.480] we're
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.560] going
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.640] to
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.920] discuss
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.180] here.
[00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.750] And
[00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.470] if
[00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.590] you
[00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.710] want
[00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.830] to
[00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.130] know
[00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.150] about
[00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.570] other
[00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.950] projection
[00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.290] models
[00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.790] I
[00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.350] recommend
[00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.650] having
[00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.770] a
[00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.890] look
[00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:26.070] into

[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.240] is

[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.260] then

[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.580] vanish
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.040] if

[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.760] you
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.060] know

[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.160] So

[00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.150] the

[00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:46.570] that
[00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:46.730] is
[00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.050] formed
[00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.830] and
[00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.970] that

[00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:48.310] is
[00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:48.490] a

[00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.070] that's
[00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.310] also
[00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:51.510] what
[00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.710] you're

[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.000] So
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.180] here
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.300] on
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.400] the

[00:07:59.700 --> 00:07:59.920] here
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.180] it's

[00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.450] Now

[00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.050] So

[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.660] showing

[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.160] coordinate
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.500] you
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:40.640] can
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:40.860] think
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.000] of

[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.320] system

[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:45.760] red
[00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.670] but
[00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.830] it's
[00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.050] just
[00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.570] difficult

[00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.950] and
[00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.110] it's
[00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.450] confusing
[00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:50.710] so
[00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.830] I
[00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:51.090] draw
[00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.570] everything

[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:57.740] So
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:57.860] what
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:57.940] we

[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:11.840] you

[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.280] think
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.400] of

[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.340] of

[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:17.480] we

[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.280] here,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:18.920] but
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.020] it
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.300] behaves
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:19.660] exactly
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:19.880] the

[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.300] So
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:22.400] how
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:22.560] can
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:22.740] we
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.220] write
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:23.400] this

[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.180] Well,

[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.380] with

[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:02.180] So
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:02.320] this
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:02.340] is
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:02.480] a

[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:03.840] and

[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:04.980] coordinates
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.160] now
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.420] this
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:06.540] is
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:06.800] a

[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.020] because
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.120] it's

[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.220] so

[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.540] But

[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.180] again
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:19.360] this

[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:22.640] It
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:22.800] doesn't

[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:42.580] So
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.560] after
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:43.760] the

[00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.910] Now
[00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:53.070] in

[00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.430] we're

[00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.290] that
[00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.430] I've
[00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:56.630] just
[00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:56.970] shown
[00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:57.570] because
[00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.050] the

[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.360] sensor

[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:03.540] We
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.000] define
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.280] the

[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.220] not

[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.680] and
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:10.260] so
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:10.420] we
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:10.700] must
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:11.280] scale
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.180] the

[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:14.920] to

[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:17.960] And
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.080] so
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.220] what
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:18.340] we
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:18.580] have
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:18.780] here
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:18.940] is
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.180] simply

[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.580] so
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:22.720] we
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:22.880] can
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.420] scale

[00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:40.270] to
[00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:40.390] be

[00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:44.270] So
[00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:44.490] let's
[00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.030] assume
[00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.390] we

[00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.190] then
[00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:52.370] we
[00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.550] would
[00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.870] convert

[00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.850] and
[00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:06.970] we're

[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.260] but
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:41.360] it

[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.220] So
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:44.520] how

[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.220] Now
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:39.580] what
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:39.700] is
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:39.800] the
