[00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.210] Okay,
[00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:02.650] so
[00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:02.790] a
[00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:02.910] rough
[00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.270] outline
[00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.510] for
[00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.070] today's
[00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.510] class
[00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.690] will
[00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:04.910] be,
[00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.250] we'll
[00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:05.510] start
[00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.690] off
[00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.830] by
[00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.010] sort
[00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.150] of
[00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.490] layering
[00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.770] on
[00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:06.930] more
[00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.030] and
[00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.130] more
[00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.590] complexity.
[00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.050] We'll
[00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.290] start
[00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.450] off
[00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.550] with
[00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:08.650] a
[00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.890] basic
[00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.570] idea,
[00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.070] which
[00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.170] is
[00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.250] a
[00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.450] Markov
[00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.930] process,
[00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.150] or
[00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.270] a
[00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.510] Markov
[00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.810] chain,
[00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.950] for
[00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.110] those
[00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.210] of
[00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:12.270] you
[00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.310] who
[00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.470] might
[00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.630] come
[00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.850] across
[00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.030] this
[00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.330] before.
[00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.430] And
[00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.550] then
[00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:14.670] we'll
[00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.850] start
[00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.970] to
[00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.230] introduce
[00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.430] some
[00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.550] of
[00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.770] the
[00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.410] perhaps
[00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.650] less
[00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.030] familiar
[00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.610] ideas,
[00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.890] which
[00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.190] are
[00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.490] essential
[00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.670] to
[00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.990] reinforcement
[00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.390] learning.
[00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.770] First
[00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:19.890] of
[00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.970] all,
[00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.110] by
[00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.270] adding
[00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.690] rewards
[00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.890] in
[00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.090] to
[00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.230] give
[00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.330] a
[00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.610] Markov
[00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:21.830] reward
[00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.370] process.
[00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.070] Then
[00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.230] by
[00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.450] adding
[00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.890] actions
[00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.170] in
[00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.410] to
[00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.530] give
[00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.630] a
[00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.890] Markov
[00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.170] decision
[00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.750] process.
[00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.450] And
[00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.710] finally,
[00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.910] we
[00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.250] probably
[00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.490] won't
[00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.630] have
[00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.810] time
[00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.930] to
[00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.090] actually
[00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.290] talk
[00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.470] about
[00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.610] them,
[00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.710] but
[00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.850] they're
[00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.930] in
[00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.030] the
[00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.250] lecture
[00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.530] notes
[00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.670] for
[00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.830] those
[00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.950] of
[00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.970] you
[00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.070] who
[00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.130] are
[00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.350] interested.
[00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.650] There's
[00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.830] a
[00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.030] lot
[00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.190] of
[00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.750] extensions
[00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.970] to
[00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.370] MVPs
[00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.510] where
[00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.610] we
[00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.730] can
[00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.930] move
[00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.330] beyond
[00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.010] these
[00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.210] three
[00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.610] settings
[00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.750] and
[00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.850] add
[00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.970] in
[00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.130] even
[00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.310] more
[00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.810] complexity
[00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.050] like
[00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.310] partial
[00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.890] observability
[00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.050] and
[00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.190] so
[00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.450] forth.
[00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.210] So
[00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.270] I'll
[00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.470] begin
[00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.670] with
[00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.910] the
[00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.390] basics.
[00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.170] I'll
[00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.330] try
[00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.470] not
[00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.610] to
[00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.770] kill
[00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.130] myself
[00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.450] today
[00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.650] on
[00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.190] any
[00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.510] stage.
[00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.790] So
[00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.190] the
[00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.430] basic
[00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.730] idea
[00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.050] then
[00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.370] is
[00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.530] we're
[00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.590] gonna
[00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.590] develop
[00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.810] this
[00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.370] formalism,
[00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.810] the
[00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.050] Markov
[00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.310] decision
[00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.890] process.
[00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.310] And
[00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.390] what
[00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.530] we're
[00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.670] trying
[00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.830] to
[00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.030] cover
[00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.230] here
[00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.330] is,
[00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.450] if
[00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.530] you
[00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.750] remember
[00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.870] in
[00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.970] the
[00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.150] last
[00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.390] class,
[00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.530] we
[00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.730] talked
[00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.930] about
[00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.290] agents
[00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.450] and
[00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.830] environments.
[00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.030] We
[00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.150] have
[00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.290] an
[00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.530] agent,
[00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.850] that's
[00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.970] our
[00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.350] algorithm,
[00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.370] and
[00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.530] that's
[00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.650] the
[00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.890] brain
[00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.010] that
[00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.130] we're
[00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.270] trying
[00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.430] to
[00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.610] build.
[00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.710] And
[00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.830] it's
[00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.190] interacting
[00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.370] with
[00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.550] some
[00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.790] world.
[00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.150] Some,
[00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.410] this
[00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.590] might
[00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.770] be
[00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.930] the
[00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.290] real
[00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.550] world
[00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.710] for
[00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.850] a
[00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.010] robot.
[00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.330] It
[00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.510] might
[00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.830] be
[00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.170] the
[00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.490] trading
[00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.810] environment
[00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.990] for
[00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.050] a
[00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.250] trading
[00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.530] agent,
[00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.750] the
[00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.990] factory
[00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.330] floor
[00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.570] for
[00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.150] a
[00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.530] factory,
[00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.850] or
[00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.090] whatever.
[00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.670] And
[00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.830] this
[00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.310] environment,
[00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.690] we
[00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.830] want
[00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.070] some
[00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.570] description
[00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.770] of
[00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.910] that
[00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.290] environment
[00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.550] such
[00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.650] that
[00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.730] we
[00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.850] can
[00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.250] understand
[00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.470] it,
[00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.690] start
[00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.810] to
[00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.110] apply
[00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.350] some
[00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.010] tools
[00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.170] to
[00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.330] it,
[00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.450] and
[00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.590] really
[00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.910] understand
[00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.150] what
[00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.270] it
[00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.430] means
[00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.550] to
[00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.610] do
[00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.030] reinforcement
[00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.290] learning
[00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.430] in
[00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.570] that
[00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.890] setting.
[00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.550] And
[00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.750] that's
[00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.850] gonna
[00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.990] be
[00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.110] the
[00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.410] MDP.
[00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.170] And
[00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.410] in
[00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.550] this
[00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.730] case,
[00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.870] what
[00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.030] we're
[00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.050] gonna
[00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.350] start
[00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.550] with
[00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.670] is
[00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.790] the
[00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.010] case,
[00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.470] the
[00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.690] nice
[00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.970] case,
[00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.130] where
[00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.230] the
[00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.510] environment
[00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.730] is
[00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.930] fully
[00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.410] observable.
[00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.610] So
[00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.790] we're
[00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.110] told
[00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.670] state.
[00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.470] So
[00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.630] this
[00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.710] is
[00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.830] the
[00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.010] case
[00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.110] where
[00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.230] we
[00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.410] see
[00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.810] everything
[00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.990] that
[00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.130] there
[00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.250] is
[00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.370] to
[00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.530] know
[00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.730] about
[00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.830] that
[00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.230] environment,
[00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.590] all
[00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.710] the
[00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.970] relevant
[00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:31.410] information
[00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.590] is
[00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.930] presented
[00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.130] to
[00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.250] our
[00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.550] agent.
[00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.170] Nothing
[00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.350] is
[00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.490] hidden
[00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.790] away.
[00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.050] And
[00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.170] one
[00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.290] way
[00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.410] to
[00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.590] think
[00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.710] of
[00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.870] this
[00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.990] is
[00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.090] that
[00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.190] the
[00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.410] current
[00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.870] state
[00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.310] that's
[00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.550] given
[00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.690] to
[00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.770] the
[00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.950] agent,
[00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.070] it
[00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.230] sort
[00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.350] of
[00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.810] completely
[00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.450] characterizes
[00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.670] this
[00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.150] process.
[00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.310] So
[00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.390] the
[00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.530] way
[00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.650] in
[00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.770] which
[00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.890] the
[00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.210] environment
[00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.230] unfolds
[00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.590] depends
[00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.930] on
[00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.170] some
[00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.510] state,
[00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.650] and
[00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.830] we're
[00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.010] told
[00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.190] that
[00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.430] state.
[00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.590] We
[00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.790] know
[00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.990] that
[00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.250] state.
[00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.430] It's
[00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.630] fully
[00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.990] observed.
[00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.430] And
[00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.830] the
[00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.070] nice
[00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.230] thing
[00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.430] about
[00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.730] this
[00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.250] formalism
[00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.470] is
[00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.670] that
[00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.090] really,
[00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.810] almost
[00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.070] all
[00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.630] reinforcement
[00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.910] learning
[00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.270] problems
[00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.450] can
[00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.610] be
[00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.030] formalized
[00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.170] in
[00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.390] some
[00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.630] way
[00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.770] as
[00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.850] a
[00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.110] Markov
[00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.370] decision
[00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.770] process.
[00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.450] So
[00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.850] if
[00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.930] you
[00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.090] think
[00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.350] about
[00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.610] even
[00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.050] some
[00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.130] of
[00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.250] these
[00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.470] less
[00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.750] familiar
[00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.210] cases,
[00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.410] for
[00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.530] those
[00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.650] of
[00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.710] you
[00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.810] who've
[00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.930] come
[00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.170] across
[00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.390] them,
[00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.870] these
[00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.970] are
[00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:04.130] things
[00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.290] which
[00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.530] people
[00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.790] might
[00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.010] not,
[00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.290] first
[00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.390] of
[00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.470] all,
[00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.690] think
[00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.790] of
[00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.930] as
[00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.170] Markov
[00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.370] decision
[00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.850] processes.
[00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.190] But
[00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.330] the
[00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.510] problem
[00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.730] of
[00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.010] optimal

[00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.090] where
[00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.230] you've
[00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.390] got,
[00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.590] say,
[00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.930] some
[00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.850] differential

[00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.150] and
[00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.250] you
[00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.410] want
[00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.530] to
[00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.790] find
[00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.990] the

[00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.510] way
[00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.650] to
[00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.810] make
[00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.970] your
[00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.310] octopus
[00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.630] swim
[00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.050] through
[00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.770] this
[00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.590] fluid.
[00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.250] How
[00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.350] do
[00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.410] we
[00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.590] actually
[00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.810] deal
[00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.950] with
[00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.170] that?
[00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.750] Well,
[00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.970] there's
[00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.050] an

[00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.610] to
[00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.070] MDPs
[00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.230] that's
[00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.450] actually
[00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.570] a
[00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.050] continuous
[00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.550] Markov
[00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.790] decision
[00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.210] process
[00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.410] with
[00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.770] continuous
[00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.250] actions.
[00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.010] And
[00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.410] optimal
[00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.850] control
[00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.170] actually
[00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.410] really
[00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.690] deals
[00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.810] with
[00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.950] that
[00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.270] case.
[00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.830] Again,
[00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.330] partially
[00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.690] observable

[00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.770] not
[00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.070] only
[00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.330] can
[00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.430] we
[00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.610] think
[00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.730] of
[00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.170] MDPs
[00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.270] to
[00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.390] give
[00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.510] us
[00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.630] some
[00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.970] intuition
[00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.230] into
[00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.390] them,
[00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.530] but
[00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.930] actually
[00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.570] any
[00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.910] partially
[00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.090] observed
[00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.530] problem
[00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.710] can
[00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.870] be
[00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.290] completely
[00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.770] converted
[00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.210] into
[00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.370] an
[00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.630] MDP.
[00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.870] So
[00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.970] it's
[00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.170] not
[00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.330] the
[00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.490] case
[00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.590] that
[00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.750] these
[00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.950] things
[00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.250] fall
[00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.830] outside
[00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.990] of
[00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.090] the
[00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.370] framework
[00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.510] of
[00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.910] MDPs.
[00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.050] They
[00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.330] are
[00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.850] MDPs.
[00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.970] They
[00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.150] really
[00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.330] are
[00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.730] MDPs.
[00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.790] And
[00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.890] if
[00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.970] you
[00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.290] understand
[00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.450] the
[00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.790] basics,
[00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.290] you
[00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.410] can
[00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.650] solve
[00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.870] all
[00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.950] of
[00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.070] these
[00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.330] problems
[00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.590] in
[00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.110] principle.
[00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.410] Some
[00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.490] of
[00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.610] the
[00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.870] simplest
[00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.250] cases,
[00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.490] which
[00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.630] we'll
[00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.830] deal
[00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.970] with
[00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:51.090] in
[00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.190] a
[00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.390] later
[00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.770] class,
[00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.890] when
[00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.990] we
[00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.150] talk
[00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.310] about
[00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.430] the
[00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.870] exploration
[00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.330] exploitation
[00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.950] dilemma
[00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.290] in
[00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.710] reinforcement
[00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.050] learning,
[00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.690] are
[00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.010] what's
[00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.170] known
[00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.330] as
[00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.670] bandits.
[00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.970] This
[00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.110] is
[00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.510] a
[00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.870] very
[00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.310] common
[00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.830] formalism
[00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.030] that's
[00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.150] used
[00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.290] a
[00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.410] lot
[00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.530] at
[00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.610] the
[00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.810] moment,
[00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.010] where
[00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.090] you
[00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.270] get
[00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.470] just
[00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.610] a
[00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.790] set
[00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.930] of
[00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.290] actions.
[00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.790] You
[00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.930] get
[00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.010] to
[00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.170] take
[00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.310] an
[00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.510] action,
[00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.670] you
[00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.810] get
[00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.990] some
[00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.330] reward
[00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.490] for
[00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.630] that
[00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.970] action,
[00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.430] and
[00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.610] that's
[00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.730] the
[00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.890] end
[00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.010] of
[00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.130] your
[00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.510] task.
[00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.130] So
[00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.270] this
[00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.410] is
[00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.590] like
[00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.730] the
[00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.110] task
[00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.270] we
[00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.450] talked
[00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.710] about
[00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.030] last
[00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.230] week,
[00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.370] where
[00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.510] you
[00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.070] present
[00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.330] an
[00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.570] advert
[00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.810] to
[00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.930] the
[00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.150] user
[00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.310] on
[00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.410] the
[00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.650] Internet.
[00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.310] And
[00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.470] that
[00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.730] advert
[00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.910] either
[00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.090] gets
[00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.330] clicked
[00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.550] on
[00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.650] or
[00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.770] it
[00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.050] doesn't,
[00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.170] and
[00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.250] you
[00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.390] want
[00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.490] it
[00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.490] to
[00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.610] be
[00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.790] clicked
[00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.950] on
[00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.050] as
[00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.210] much
[00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.350] as
[00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.650] possible.
[00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.390] And
[00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.590] actually,
[00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.790] this
[00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.910] is
[00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.090] just
[00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.210] a
[00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.450] Markov
[00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.690] decision
[00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.030] process
[00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.290] with
[00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.450] only
[00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.670] one
[00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.970] state.
[00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.510] So
[00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.850] again,
[00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.050] it's
[00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.170] a
[00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.370] special
[00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.670] case
[00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.790] of
[00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.230] MDPs.
[00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.310] If
[00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.410] we
[00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.570] can
[00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.770] solve
[00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.230] MDPs,
[00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.310] we
[00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.430] can
[00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.650] solve
[00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.910] all
[00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.010] of
[00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.150] these
[00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.430] different
[00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.810] cases.
[00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.750] So
[00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.830] it's
[00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.010] really
[00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.530] fundamental.
[00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.730] So
[00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.250] what's
[00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.350] the
[00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.610] central
[00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.890] idea
[00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:28.050] to
[00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.170] an
[00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.430] MDP?
[00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.830] Well,
[00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.090] we've
[00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.250] already
[00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.510] seen
[00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.670] this
[00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.770] in
[00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.870] the
[00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.050] last
[00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.310] class,
[00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.450] but
[00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.570] it's
[00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.710] such
[00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.810] an
[00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.030] important
[00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.330] concept,
[00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.490] I'm
[00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.570] just
[00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.670] gonna
[00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.970] flash
[00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:32.090] up
[00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.250] this
[00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.530] slide
[00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.070] again,
[00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.210] which
[00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.330] is
[00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.470] the
[00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.770] Markov
[00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.130] property.
[00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.470] And
[00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.730] again,
[00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.990] the
[00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.270] Markov
[00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.510] property,
[00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.670] the
[00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.910] central
[00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.150] idea
[00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.330] which
[00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.430] we're
[00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.630] trying
[00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.770] to
[00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.050] understand
[00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.350] here
[00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.470] is
[00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.710] this
[00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.170] idea
[00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.330] that
[00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.430] you
[00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.590] have
[00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.770] some
[00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.190] state,
[00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.490] this
[00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.210] random
[00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.590] variable
[00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.950] S.
[00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.170] This
[00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.330] is
[00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.950] characterizing
[00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.430] where
[00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.570] we
[00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.790] are
[00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.210] in
[00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.590] our
[00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.990] environment.
[00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.110] And
[00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.330] if
[00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.410] it
[00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.590] has
[00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.730] the
[00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.990] Markov
[00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.350] property,
[00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.090] then
[00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.070] this
[00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.390] basically
[00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.650] tells
[00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.790] us
[00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.890] that
[00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.010] the
[00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.350] future
[00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.870] is
[00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.290] independent
[00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.470] of
[00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.570] the
[00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.790] past,
[00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.970] given
[00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.130] the
[00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.410] present.
[00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.950] In
[00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:54.110] other
[00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.370] words,
[00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.850] what
[00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.170] happens
[00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.630] next
[00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.890] in
[00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.030] our
[00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.430] environment
[00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.090] depends
[00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.550] only
[00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.850] on
[00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.550] our
[00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.890] previous
[00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.230] state,
[00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.690] and
[00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.970] not
[00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:00.230] on
[00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.430] all
[00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.530] the
[00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.690] things
[00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.830] which
[00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.990] came
[00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.270] before
[00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.530] that.
[00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.050] Okay,
[00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.190] so
[00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.290] the
[00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.490] state
[00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.010] completely
[00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.690] characterizes
[00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.530] everything
[00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.750] which
[00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.870] we
[00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.030] need
[00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.150] to
[00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.310] know,
[00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.450] it
[00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.670] captures
[00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.950] all
[00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:07.070] the
[00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.310] relevant
[00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.750] information
[00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.990] from
[00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.090] the
[00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.430] history.
[00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.970] And
[00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.130] once
[00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.250] you
[00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.410] know
[00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.570] this
[00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.830] thing,
[00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.130] you
[00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.250] can
[00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.610] essentially,
[00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.290] if
[00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.370] you
[00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.570] have
[00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.850] ST,
[00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.410] what
[00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.570] this
[00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.750] tells
[00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.930] us
[00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.030] is
[00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.110] you
[00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.230] can
[00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.430] throw
[00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.650] away
[00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.870] everything
[00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.050] which
[00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.210] came
[00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.450] before.
[00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.610] So
[00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.050] the
[00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.250] set
[00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.410] of
[00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.730] Markov
[00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.130] processes,
[00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.390] or
[00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.490] the
[00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.630] set
[00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.790] of
[00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.090] states
[00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.250] that
[00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.430] have
[00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.610] this
[00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.950] property,
[00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.690] is
[00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.810] the
[00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.010] set
[00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.170] of
[00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.390] environments
[00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.150] in
[00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.510] which
[00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.170] everything
[00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.350] which
[00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.550] we
[00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.490] know
[00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.670] about
[00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.810] the
[00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.070] system
[00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.410] can
[00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.530] be
[00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.890] described
[00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.110] by
[00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.330] this
[00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.890] single
[00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.310] state
[00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.550] at
[00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.670] the
[00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.870] current
[00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.190] time.
[00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.290] And
[00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.370] we
[00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.510] don't
[00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.650] need
[00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.910] to
[00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.310] retain
[00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.610] everything
[00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.750] that
[00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.890] we've
[00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.010] ever
[00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.230] seen,
[00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.030] okay?
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.520] So
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.960] one
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.100] way
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.220] to
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.600] understand
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.900] this
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.040] is
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.320] that
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.020] for
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.400] any
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.360] problem
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.520] with
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.640] the
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.940] Markov
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.800] property,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.020] for
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.200] any
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.520] Markov
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.020] process,
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.580] if
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.680] you
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.000] start
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.120] in
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.300] some
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.680] state
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.180] S,
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.760] and
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.920] you've
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.300] got
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.500] some
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.880] successor
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.220] state,
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.620] S
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.980] prime,
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.100] then
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.440] you
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.560] can
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.740] actually
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.120] define
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.300] the
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.700] probability
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.940] that
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.060] you'll
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.420] transition
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.640] from
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.760] one
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.840] of
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.000] those
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.220] states
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.360] to
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.460] the
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.640] next
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.940] state.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.700] So
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.920] given,
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.420] remember
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.600] that
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.860] this
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.340] state
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.500] which
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.620] we
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.760] were
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.000] in,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.660] characterizes
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.100] everything
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.340] about
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.480] what
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.580] will
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.780] happen
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.140] next.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.740] So
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.860] that
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.040] must
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.240] mean
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.380] that
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.520] there's
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.680] some
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.920] well
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.360]-defined
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.940] transition
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.480] probability
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.080] that
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.260] tells
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.400] me
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.540] that
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.660] if
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.760] I
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.840] was
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.960] in
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.120] this
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.320] state
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.660] before,
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.260] there's
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.420] some
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.920] probability,
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.380] given
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.520] that
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.600] I
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.700] was
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.800] in
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.960] that
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.260] state,
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.440] that
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.560] I
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.660] will
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.100] transition
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.620] to

[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.100] There's
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.240] some
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.640] probability
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.000] that,
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.120] you
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.180] know,
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.300] if
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.420] my
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.660] robot
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.880] is
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.140] here,
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.660] and
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.700] I
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.840] give
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.940] it
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.020] a
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.120] little
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.400] push,
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.600] then
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.680] it
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.900] will,
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.100] you
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.180] know,
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.400] fall
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.620] over
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.760] to
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.020] here,
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.160] or
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.400] maybe
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.720] put
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.860] a
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.000] foot
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.320] forward.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.920] All
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.020] of
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.160] these
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.340] things
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.440] are
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.800] completely
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.240] characterized
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.560] by
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.680] the
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.900] state
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.020] it
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.120] was
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.260] in
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.560] before,
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.080] okay?
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.840] And
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.940] so
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.120] this
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.300] gives
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.480] us
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.740] our
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.100] state
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.640] transition
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.800] probabilities.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.520] So
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.620] it's
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.720] the
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.100] probability
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.320] that
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.420] if
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.540] I'm
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.600] in
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.860] S,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.180] I
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.580] transition
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.800] to
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.980] S
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.280] prime,
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.020] and
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.140] that
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.300] gives
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.420] us
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.520] the
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.820] probability
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.980] of
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.100] this
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.520] random
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.960] next
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.340] state
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.260] will
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.520] be
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.840] this
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.260] particular
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.940] instantiation
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.100] of
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.180] the
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.360] state
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.580] S
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.900] prime,
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.480] given
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.660] that
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.780] the
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.020] previous
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.240] state
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.380] we
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.460] were
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.680] in,
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.980] our
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.180] current
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.420] state
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.560] at
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.720] time
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.940] T
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.220] was
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.740] this
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.000] S.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.380] Now,
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.740] once
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.880] we
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.080] have
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.340] this
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.780] idea
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.900] of

[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.340] matrix,
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.300] we
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.480] can,
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.680] we
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.820] can
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.020] form
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.600] this
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.780] into
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.920] a
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.200] complete
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.580] matrix
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.800] that
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.020] tells
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.220] us,
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.580] essentially,
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.260] each
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.520] row
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.640] of
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.780] this
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.220] matrix
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.940] tells
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.160] us
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.360] what
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.500] would
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.920] happen
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.740] for
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.900] each
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.180] state
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.320] that
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.480] I
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.620] was
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.800] in.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.340] So
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.540] if
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.660] I
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.960] start
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.100] in
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.300] state
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.600] one,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.140] this
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.360] tells
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.480] me
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.600] the
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.000] probability
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.260] that
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.400] I'll
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.580] end
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.760] up
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.920] in
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.180] state
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.460] one
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.720] here,
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.020] state
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.280] two
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.520] here,
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.800] state
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.060] three
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.340] here,
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.780] all
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.880] the
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.940] way
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.040] up
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.160] to
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.320] end
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.640] states
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.880] here.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.720] So
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.900] each
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.100] row
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.220] of
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.360] this
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.720] completely
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.300] characterizes
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.500] the
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.940] transitions
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.240] from
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.460] one
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.760] possible
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.120] starting
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.440] place
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.580] in
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.800] this,
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.080] in

[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.480] Markov
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.840] process.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.960] So
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.120] this
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.360] single
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.760] matrix
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.980] now
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.200] gives
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.320] me
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.440] the

[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.780] to
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.980] this
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.240] Markov
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.600] problem.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.300] Tells
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.400] me
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.560] from
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.740] any
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.060] state,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.300] how
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.580] likely
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.740] am
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.860] I
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.980] to
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.100] end
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.240] up
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.340] in
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.500] any
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.660] other
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.940] state?
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.580] So,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.180] you
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.280] can
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.540] imagine
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.740] now
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.840] that
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.920] we
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.040] can
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.280] follow
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.460] this
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.640] through
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.980] multiple
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.480] steps,
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.000] and
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.160] keep
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.520] sampling
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.720] from
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.860] this
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.240] transition
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.760] probabilities,
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.020] and
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.140] that
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.240] will
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.420] give
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.700] us
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.320] some
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.620] draws
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.860] from
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.020] this
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.320] Markov
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.740] process.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.180] So,
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.940] let's
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.080] try
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.160] and
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.460] understand
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.680] that
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.760] a
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.860] little
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.020] bit
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.280] more.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.660] So
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.840] now,
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.040] just
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.440] formally,
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.920] a
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.240] Markov
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.780] process
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.220] is
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.540] basically
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.740] a
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.900] random
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.460] process,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.660] a
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.920] process
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.120] that
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.300] we're
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.460] sort
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.560] of
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.860] sampling
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.240] from,
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.800] iteratively.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.240] So
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.420] that,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.840] basically,
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.260] our
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.600] definition
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.840] for
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.020] this
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.140] is
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.300] going
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.380] to
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.460] be,
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.580] it's
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.700] a
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.980] sequence
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.220] of
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.480] random
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.960] states.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.740] So
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.880] a
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.020] sequence
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.220] of
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.400] random
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.780] states,
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.480] S1,
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.080] S2,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.840] going
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.180] on
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.840] in
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.180] time,
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.580] that
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.000] has
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.140] the
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.380] Markov
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.700] property.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.540] That's
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.760] the
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.100] definition
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.260] of
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.320] a
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.540] Markov
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.840] process,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.080] it's
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.200] just
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.320] a
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.580] sequence
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.740] of
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.980] states
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.080] with
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.180] a
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.420] Markov
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.760] property.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.500] And
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.740] so,
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.500] all
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.660] it
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.480] requires
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.700] to
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.980] define
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.160] this
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.440] thing
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.180] is
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.560] a
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.800] state
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.260] space,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.000] S,
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.300] this
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.400] is
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.520] the
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.680] set
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.820] of
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.060] states
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.200] which
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.320] we
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.440] can
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.600] be
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.780] in,
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.800] and
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.160] a
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.500] transition
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.000] probabilities
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.340] that
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.740] characterize
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.020] how
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.140] we
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.460] transition
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.680] from
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.860] one
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.060] state
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.180] to
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.260] the
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.500] next.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.320] Okay,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.920] and
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.220] now,
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.600] this
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.840] fully
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.320] defines
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.520] the
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.880] dynamics
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.040] of
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.160] this
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.340] whole
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.700] system.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.940] There's
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:09.100] some
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.500] evolution
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.720] of
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.940] our

[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.120] through
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.340] this
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.700] system,
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:11.960] or
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.100] of
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.280] our

[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.100] through
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.260] its
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.620] environment,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.880] or
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.000] of
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.180] our
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.380] chess
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.620] playing
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.880] agent
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.080] through
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.240] the
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.420] rules
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.540] of
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.620] the

[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.360] all
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.460] of
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.600] these
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.800] things
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.940] can
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.080] be
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.560] defined.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.660] No
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.980] actions
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.260] yet,
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.680] no
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.980] rewards
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.180] yet,
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.380] but
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:20.780] the
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.400] dynamics
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.600] can
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.700] be
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.920] fully
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.280] defined
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.500] by
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:22.620] a
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:22.780] state
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.060] space
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.160] and
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.260] a
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.580] transition
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.980] probability
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.520] matrix,
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.940] okay,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.320] that's
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.420] the
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.640] Markov
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.940] process.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.280] So,
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:28.820] I
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.940] think
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.020] it
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.260] always
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.500] helps
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.620] to
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.740] make
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.900] these
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.100] things
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.440] concrete,
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.200] so
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.600] let's
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.860] try
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:31.940] and
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.040] make
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.240] this
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.720] concrete
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:32.880] for
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.020] you
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.320] guys.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:35.820] So,
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.180] this
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.300] is
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.600] my
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.200] cartoon
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.800] illustration
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.100] of
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.200] what
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:39.320] I
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.600] imagine
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.760] it's
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.940] like
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.040] to
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.160] be
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.380] sitting
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:40.540] in
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.680] my
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.020] lectures,
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.320] and
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.460] so
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:42.560] we're
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:42.660] just
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:42.780] going
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:42.960] to
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.340] imagine
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:43.540] there's
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.720] only
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:43.940] three
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.320] classes
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:44.540] you
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.740] have
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.840] to
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.040] sit
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.280] through,
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:45.920] if
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.000] you
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.140] get
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.280] through
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.420] all
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.580] three
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.060] classes,
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.340] then
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.560] don't
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.700] worry,
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:47.860] we
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.080] managed
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.240] to
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.580] pass
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:48.720] the
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.040] class,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.380] if
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:49.520] only
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.600] it
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.680] was
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:49.780] that
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.000] easy,
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.200] but
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.420] anyway,
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:51.900] but
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.060] the
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.260] problem
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.460] is
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:52.560] that
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:52.680] there's
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:52.800] all
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:52.920] these
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.380] distractions
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:53.700] along
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:53.820] the
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.040] way.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.340] So,
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:54.680] you
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:54.920] start
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.080] off
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:55.200] in
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.300] the
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.540] first
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:55.920] class,
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.580] and
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:56.780] there's
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:56.880] a
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.320] 50
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.520]%
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:57.900] probability
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.140] you'll
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:58.300] make
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:58.400] it
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.520] through
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:58.640] to
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:58.720] the
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:58.900] next
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.220] class.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:07:59.580] There's
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:07:59.760] also
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:07:59.900] a

[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.680] probability
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:00.920] that
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.040] you
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.240] guys
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.340] will
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:01.500] open
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:01.600] up
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:01.720] your
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.120] laptops,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:02.900] start
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.140] looking
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.260] at
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:03.680] Facebook.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.460] Now,
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.100] if
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:06.180] you
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:06.300] look
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.440] at
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:06.720] Facebook,
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:06.980] we
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.120] all
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.340] know
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.540] that
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:07.900] once
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.060] you're
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.200] in
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.480] Facebook,
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:08.760] it's
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:08.860] a
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:08.960] little

[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.460] addictive,
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:09.740] so
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:09.840] there's
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.060] probably
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.340] about
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:10.500] a

[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:11.640] that
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:11.760] you'll
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:11.900] just
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.120] kind
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.240] of

[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.040]-transition
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.560] and
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:13.740] keep
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:13.980] looking
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.100] at
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.380] Facebook,
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:14.640] keep
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:14.860] looking
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.000] at
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.260] Facebook
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.660] again.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:16.460] And
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:16.700] then,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.380] maybe
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:17.640] after
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:17.760] you
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.060] iterate
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.360] around
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:18.540] this
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:18.700] thing
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:18.820] for
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:18.920] a
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.020] few
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.340] times,
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:19.580] there's
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:19.760] a

[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:20.720] probability
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:20.940] that
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:21.040] you'll
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.300] actually
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:21.860] drop
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.080] out
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.220] of
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:22.480] this
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:22.980] Facebook
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.240] and
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:23.460] get
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:23.660] back
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:23.800] to
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:23.900] the
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.200] class
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.360] and
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:24.780] listen
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:24.960] to
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.120] the
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.420] rest
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:25.520] of
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:25.600] the
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:25.900] class,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:26.520] which
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:26.740] point
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:26.880] you
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.160] might
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.660] make
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:27.760] it
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:27.840] to
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:27.960] the
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.180] second
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.620] class.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.280] Unfortunately,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:30.640] maybe
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:30.820] we're
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.000] talking
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.260] about
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:31.520] something
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:31.820] really
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.240] tedious,
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:32.460] like
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:32.820] Markov
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.420] processes,
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:33.680] and
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:33.760] then
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:33.840] you
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.160] feel
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:34.260] a
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.400] bit
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.000] sleepy.
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:35.540] And
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:35.740] so,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.000] there's
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.200] maybe
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.360] a

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:37.900] asleep,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.280] but
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:39.540] there's
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:39.760] maybe
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.280] an

[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:41.600] through
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:41.740] to

[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:43.620] At
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:43.820] which
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.220] point,
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.760] maybe
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.260] you
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:46.460] think,
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:46.660] yeah,
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:46.780] I'm
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:46.900] doing
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.160] really
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.440] well,
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:47.660] and
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.300] you
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.420] get
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:48.560] a
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:48.560] bit
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:48.880] excited
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.040] and
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.160] go
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:49.280] off
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:49.360] to

[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.040] which
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:51.300] means
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:51.440] if
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:51.500] you
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:51.600] go
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:51.660] to
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:51.780] the
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:51.960] pub,
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.100] you
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.260] drink
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:52.400] a
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:52.520] few
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:52.860] beers,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.400] you
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.580] might
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:53.780] end
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.020] up
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:54.320] either
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.020] regressing
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.260] back
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:55.400] to
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:55.620] class
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:55.800] one
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:55.920] or
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.140] class
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.340] two
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:56.520] because
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:56.620] of
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:56.700] all
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:56.800] the
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:56.960] things
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.060] you
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.420] forget.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:08:59.100] Or,
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:08:59.460] if
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:08:59.520] you
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:08:59.640] don't
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:08:59.780] go
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:08:59.860] to
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:08:59.960] the
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.140] pub,
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.280] there's
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:00.340] a
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:00.520] 60
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:00.840]%
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.580] chance
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:01.700] that
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:01.780] you'll
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.140] pass,
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:02.520] and
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:02.860] then
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.360] after
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:04.520] that,
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:04.600] you
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:04.700] can
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:04.820] go
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:04.940] to
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.140] sleep
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:05.240] and
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.520] everyone's
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:05.740] happy,
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:06.560] okay?
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:06.700] And
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:06.840] this
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.100] sleep
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.320] state
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.740] represents
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:07.940] a
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.240] terminal
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.680] state
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.080] to

[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:10.620] A
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:10.840] terminal
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.100] state
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.380] doesn't
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:11.520] need
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:11.700] any
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:11.960] special
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.340] machinery.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:12.500] You
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:12.580] can
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:12.760] think
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:12.880] of
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.020] this
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.140] as
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.360] just
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.660] a
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:13.980] self
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.300]-loop,
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:14.740] an
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.100] absorbing
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.440] terminal
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:15.720] state.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:15.840] It
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:15.960] just
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.160] keeps
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.420] looping
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:16.620] around
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:16.720] and
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:16.900] around
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.040] and
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.200] around.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:17.740] That's
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:17.820] what
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:17.940] this
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.140] square
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.660] represents.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:19.360] By
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.420] the
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:19.520] way,
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:19.620] there's
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:19.700] a
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:19.820] few
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.000] more
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.220] seats
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.440] over
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:20.580] here,
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:20.700] I
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:20.840] think,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:20.960] if
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.100] anyone
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.320] wants
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.720] to
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.440] just
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:22.840] move
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.160] around.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:23.700] If
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:23.820] you're
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.000] okay,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.240] that's
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.400] fine.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.220] Okay,
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:28.700] so
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:28.840] now
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:28.960] that
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.120] we've
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.280] got
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:29.620] this
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.160] student
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.480] Markov
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:30.680] chain,
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:30.940] let's
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.300] think
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:31.480] about
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:31.600] what
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:31.720] it
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:31.960] means
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.100] to
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.280] take
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.640] samples
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:32.820] of
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.020] this.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:33.580] So
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:33.920] what's
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.020] a
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.260] sample?
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:34.460] A
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:34.680] sample
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:34.880] is
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:34.980] a
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.300] sequence.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:35.520] It's
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:35.620] a
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:35.900] sequence
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.120] of
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.400] states
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:36.580] where
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:36.700] we
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.040] start,
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:37.460] for
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:37.680] example,
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:37.840] in
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:37.940] our
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:38.180] class
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:38.460] one,
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:39.580] and
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:39.760] now
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:39.880] we're
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.000] just
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.140] gonna
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.540] take
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:40.900] samples
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.140] through
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:41.340] this
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:41.680] system.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:41.880] For
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.200] example,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.220] one
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:43.520] sample
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:43.720] might
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:43.900] look
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.080] like
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.300] this,
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:44.440] where
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:44.540] we
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:44.660] go
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:44.960] class
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.200] one,
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:45.520] class
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:45.740] two,
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.040] class
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.420] three,
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.280] pass,
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:47.740] fall
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.040] asleep,
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:48.720] okay?
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.220] That's
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.320] the
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:49.500] nice
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:49.800] sample.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.680] But
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:50.760] you
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:50.900] might
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.200] also
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.380] have
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:51.600] another
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:51.900] sample
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.100] that's
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.260] like
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:52.840] class
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.220] one,
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:53.920] Facebook,
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:54.900] Facebook
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.340] again,
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.000] that's
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.260] class
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:56.620] one,
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.240] that's
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.460] class
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:57.660] two,
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:57.760] and
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:57.900] then
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.100] fall
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.420] asleep.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.380] You
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:09:59.540] might
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:09:59.760] have
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.180] more
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:00.700] complicated
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.660] samples.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.100] Some
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.200] of
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.300] them
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:03.460] might
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:03.600] go
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:03.760] on
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:03.840] and
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:03.980] on
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.100] for
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:04.320] quite
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:04.440] a
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:04.540] long
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:04.820] time.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.000] These
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.140] are

[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:06.800] you
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:06.900] could

[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:11.600] okay?
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:11.720] So
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:11.900] that's
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:11.980] what

[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.160] And

[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:21.740] that

[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:25.880] like.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.220] It
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:26.340] can

[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:27.560] from
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:27.760] any
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.100] state,
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:28.620] there's
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:28.760] some

[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:29.400] of

[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:31.780] Is
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:31.860] that
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.040] clear?
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.180] Good.
[00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.270] Okay.
[00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:35.850] And
[00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:36.130] now,
[00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:36.670] we
[00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.790] can
[00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.950] look
[00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:37.030] at
[00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.150] the

[00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:38.470] problem.
[00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.810] So
[00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.930] the

[00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:39.550] matrix

[00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.930] matrix
[00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:43.390] basically
[00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:43.790] tells
[00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.070] us,
[00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:44.390] for

[00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:45.190] states
[00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.370] which
[00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:45.590] we
[00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.830] might

[00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.290] in,
[00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.610] what's

[00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:49.410] So
[00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:49.590] for
[00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.830] example,
[00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:49.990] if
[00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.090] we

[00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:52.310] and
[00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.390] we

[00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.290] basically
[00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:56.630] tells
[00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.870] us
[00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.370] there's

[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:23.820] question?
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.220] So

[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:27.880] each
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.480] state.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:28.760] How
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:28.880] do
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.020] you
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.340] make
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:29.500] it
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:29.680] such
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:29.900] that
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.420] if
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:30.540] you
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:30.700] were
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:30.900] to,
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.480] say,
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:31.900] go
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.080] to
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.420] Facebook,
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.200] then
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:33.420] you
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:33.560] have
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:33.680] a
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.040] reducing
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.660] probability
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:34.980] each
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.260] time
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.000] you
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.000]-
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.140] Okay,
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:36.600] so
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:36.700] the
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:36.920] question
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.080] is,
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:37.220] how
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:37.280] do
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:37.400] we
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:37.620] deal
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:37.980] with
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.980] modifications
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.200] to
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.360] these
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:39.760] probabilities
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.080] over
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.380] time?
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:40.980] So
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.400] there's
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:41.580] two
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:41.840] answers
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.040] to
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:42.280] that.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.560] One
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:43.800] answer
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:43.940] is
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.040] that
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.120] you
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.240] can
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:44.400] have
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:44.520] a
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:44.680] non
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.220]-stationary
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:45.860] Markov
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.340] process.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.200] Later
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:47.380] we'll
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:47.520] have
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:47.840] MDP,
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.100] so
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.300] non
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:48.680]-stationary
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:48.980] MDP.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:51.700] In
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:51.880] that
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.120] case,
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:52.260] what
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:52.360] you
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:52.460] can
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:52.600] do
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:52.720] is
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:52.840] use
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:52.960] the
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.160] same
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.380] kind
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:53.460] of
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:53.800] algorithms
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:53.980] we
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.140] use
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:54.220] for
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:54.340] the
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:54.580] stationary
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:54.900] case,
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.080] but
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.620] incrementally
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:55.900] adjust
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.060] your
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.400] solution
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:56.720] algorithm
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:56.920] to
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.060] just
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.240] kind
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.360] of
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:57.680] track
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:57.920] the
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.240] best
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.520] solution
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:58.720] you've
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:58.840] found
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.060] so
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.280] far.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:00.780] The
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:00.960] other
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.240] answer
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:01.380] is
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:01.480] to
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:01.660] say,
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:01.900] well,
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.340] the
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:02.500] fact
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:02.600] that
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:02.680] you've
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:02.780] got
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:02.980] non
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.300]-stationary
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:03.680] dynamics
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.220] just
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:04.500] makes
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:04.620] it
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:04.760] a
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:04.900] more
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.460] complicated
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:05.840] Markov
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.300] process.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:06.800] That
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.020] there's
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.260] some,
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:07.980] so
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.160] you're
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.460] imagining
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:08.620] that
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:08.880] there's
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.560] probabilities
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:09.840] that
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.080] depend
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.200] on
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:10.380] how
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:10.580] long
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:10.760] you've
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:10.920] been
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.080] in
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.260] this
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:11.480] state
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:11.640] and
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:11.800] so
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.100] forth.
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.620] So
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:12.760] now
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:12.860] you
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:12.980] can
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.340] augment
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:13.560] this
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:13.860] state,
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.000] you
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.060] can
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.160] have
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.240] a
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:14.360] more
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:14.840] complicated
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.340] Markov
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:15.760] process
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.240] that
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:16.420] has
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:16.580] like
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:16.720] a
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.040] counter
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.660] that
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:17.880] tells
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.000] you
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.120] how
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.300] long
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:18.460] you've
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:18.580] been
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:18.720] in
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:18.940] this
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.520] Facebook
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:19.860] state.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:20.400] And
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:20.580] now
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:20.740] you've
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:20.940] basically
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.140] got
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.340] lots
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:21.460] of
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:21.740] different
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.020] states,
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:22.300] depending
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:22.480] on
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:22.640] whether
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:22.800] you've
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:22.900] been
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.060] in
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:23.340] Facebook
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:23.960] once
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.140] or
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:24.440] twice
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:24.600] or
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:24.780] three
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.120] times.
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.100] And
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.200] you
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.280] can
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:26.380] have
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:26.480] an

[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.120] of
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.280] these,
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.420] you
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:27.520] can
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:27.660] have
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:27.800] a
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.020] continuous
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:28.580] set
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:28.700] of
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:28.900] these.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:29.700] All
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:29.800] of
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:29.940] these
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.100] things
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.220] are
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.560] possible,
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.300] but
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:31.460] they
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:31.640] don't
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:31.900] change
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.020] the
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.300] fundamental
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.740] structure
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:32.980] from
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.100] this
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.260] being
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:33.380] a
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:33.600] Markov
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.000] process.
[00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:36.570] This
[00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:36.710] is
[00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.850] just
[00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:36.970] a
[00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:37.270] particular
[00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:37.790] simple

[00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:39.110] where
[00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.190] we
[00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.270] can
[00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:39.430] see
[00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.750] everything
[00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.930] on

[00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:40.370] page,
[00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.550] but
[00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.210] don't
[00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.590] let
[00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.890] that
[00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.450] mislead
[00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:42.590] you
[00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.750] into
[00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.030] thinking
[00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.250] that
[00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.530] Markov
[00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:43.870] processes
[00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:44.050] are
[00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:44.530] necessarily
[00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:44.930] small
[00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:45.090] or
[00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:45.370] simple.
[00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.090] We
[00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:46.250] can
[00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.430] solve
[00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.610] very,
[00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.750] very
[00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.230] complex
[00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.590] Markov
[00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.930] processes
[00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.110] in
[00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.210] the
[00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:48.330] rest
[00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:48.430] of
[00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.510] the
[00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:48.710] course.
[00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:48.870] We'll
[00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.050] see
[00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:49.210] how
[00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:49.350] to
[00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.650] solve
[00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.850] MDPs.
[00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.750] Some
[00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.850] of
[00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:51.930] them
[00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:52.070] have
[00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:52.250] 10
[00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.330] to
[00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:52.410] the
[00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:52.830] 170
[00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.310] states
[00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.490] will
[00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:53.590] be
[00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.750] one
[00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.830] of
[00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:53.910] the
[00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:54.230] examples
[00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.430] we'll
[00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.570] do
[00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:54.830] later.
[00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:55.130] So
[00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:55.630] these
[00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:55.750] can
[00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.850] be
[00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:56.050] very
[00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.310] large
[00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.450] and
[00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:56.730] complex
[00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:57.130] pieces
[00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.390] with
[00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:57.490] a
[00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:57.590] lot
[00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.690] of
[00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:57.950] structure
[00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:58.150] to
[00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.350] them.
[00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:01.150] Okay,
[00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.630] so
[00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.050] far
[00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.190] we
[00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:02.390] haven't
[00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:02.550] really
[00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.750] talked
[00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.930] about
[00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:03.330] reinforcement
[00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:03.690] learning
[00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:03.950] at
[00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:04.150] all.
[00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.310] There's
[00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.470] no
[00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.790] rewards,
[00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:04.970] there's
[00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:05.130] no
[00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:05.390] action.
[00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:05.650] So
[00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:05.810] let's
[00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.990] start
[00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.110] to
[00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.290] put
[00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.450] in
[00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:06.630] some
[00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:06.710] of
[00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.830] that
[00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:07.130] machinery
[00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:07.410] now.
[00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:08.390] And
[00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:08.510] the
[00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:08.750] first
[00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.870] and
[00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:09.070] perhaps
[00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:09.310] most
[00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.650] important
[00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:09.970] step
[00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:10.430] is
[00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.570] to
[00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:10.730] add
[00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.170] rewards.
[00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.890] And
[00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:11.990] so
[00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.130] one
[00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:12.270] way
[00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:12.390] to
[00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:12.550] think
[00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.650] of
[00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.830] this
[00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:12.930] is
[00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:13.070] we're
[00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.170] now
[00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:13.350] going
[00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.430] to
[00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.670] create
[00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.910] what's
[00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.010] called
[00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.130] a
[00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:14.390] Markov
[00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:14.670] reward
[00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.010] process,
[00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:15.450] which
[00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:15.550] you
[00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.650] can
[00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.850] think
[00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:15.970] of
[00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:16.070] as
[00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:16.230] like
[00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.330] a
[00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:16.590] Markov
[00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.890] process
[00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.230] with
[00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.550] value
[00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.910] judgments.
[00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:19.230] So
[00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.410] there's
[00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:19.650] some
[00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.230] value
[00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.510] judgment
[00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:20.810] saying
[00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.990] how
[00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.170] good
[00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.310] it
[00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.630] is
[00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:21.850] to
[00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.050] be
[00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:22.290] in
[00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:22.890] some
[00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:23.350] particular,
[00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.810] you
[00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.890] know,
[00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:24.050] there's
[00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.210] some
[00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:24.530] value
[00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.790] judgment
[00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.050] saying
[00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:25.510] how
[00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:25.690] much
[00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:25.950] reward
[00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:26.110] will
[00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.230] I
[00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.370] have
[00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:26.790] accumulated
[00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.210] across
[00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:27.750] some
[00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.050] particular
[00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.490] sequence
[00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.630] that
[00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:28.750] we
[00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:28.970] sample
[00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:29.230] from
[00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.490] this
[00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.070] Markov
[00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:30.390] process.
[00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.550] So
[00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.730] all
[00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.890] we're
[00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:31.910] going
[00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.970] to
[00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:32.110] do
[00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.250] to
[00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:32.430] add
[00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.710] into
[00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.170] our
[00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.090] Markov
[00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:34.370] process
[00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.610] is
[00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.730] we're
[00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:34.850] going
[00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.970] to
[00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:35.170] add
[00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:35.310] in
[00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.470] two
[00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.730] things.
[00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:35.910] So
[00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.990] we
[00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.130] had
[00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:36.290] our
[00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.530] state
[00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.830] space
[00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.110] S
[00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.750] and
[00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.870] our
[00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.210] transition
[00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.650] dynamics
[00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:38.890] P.
[00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.510] Now
[00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:39.630] what
[00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:39.770] we're
[00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:39.870] going
[00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.990] to
[00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.150] add
[00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.290] in
[00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:40.430] is
[00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.650] some
[00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.330] reward,
[00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:42.090] a
[00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.310] reward
[00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.670] function
[00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.010] R
[00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:43.610] and
[00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:43.710] a
[00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.990] discount
[00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.370] factor
[00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:44.650] gamma.
[00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.210] Let's
[00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:45.350] just
[00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.530] talk
[00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.710] about
[00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.830] what
[00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:46.010] those
[00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:46.150] are
[00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.250] and
[00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.370] make
[00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.490] sure
[00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:46.590] we
[00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.910] understand
[00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:47.190] them.
[00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:48.330] So
[00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:48.870] the
[00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.130] reward
[00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:49.490] function,
[00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:49.790] first
[00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.910] of
[00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:50.110] all,
[00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.590] this
[00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.690] is
[00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:50.930] something
[00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:51.130] which
[00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:51.390] tells
[00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:51.670] us
[00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.150] if
[00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.250] we
[00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:52.610] start

[00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:53.850] S,
[00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:54.530] if
[00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.630] we're
[00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:54.770] in

[00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.110] only?
[00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.510] This
[00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:58.630] is
[00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:58.790] just
[00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.910] the
[00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:59.170] immediate

[00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:01.990] that
[00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.310] moment?
[00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:02.870] And
[00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.950] what
[00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:03.070] we
[00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:03.210] care
[00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:03.490] about
[00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.010] is
[00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:04.630] maximizing

[00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.170] rewards.
[00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.410] That's
[00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:06.510] what
[00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:06.610] we
[00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:06.770] care

[00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.710] learning.
[00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.390] So
[00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:08.510] for
[00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:08.610] the

[00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:11.050] together
[00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:11.270] over
[00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:11.570] time.
[00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.170] The
[00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.510] R,
[00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:12.790] for
[00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:13.010] now,
[00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:13.170] it
[00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:13.310] just
[00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.530] tells
[00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:13.730] us
[00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.910] for
[00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:14.150] one
[00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.470] step.
[00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.890] At
[00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.050] that
[00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.430] moment,
[00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:16.070] if
[00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:16.270] we're
[00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:16.670] at
[00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.910] time
[00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:17.210] T

[00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:19.690] time
[00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:19.890] T
[00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:20.070] plus
[00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:20.370] one,
[00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.770] we'll
[00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:20.950] get
[00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:21.130] this
[00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:21.430] reward.
[00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.610] It
[00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:21.750] just
[00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.930] tells
[00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:22.070] us
[00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:22.210] what

[00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.510] happen
[00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:22.810] next.
[00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:26.930] So
[00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:27.030] if
[00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.110] we
[00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.250] go
[00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:27.450] back

[00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.150] is
[00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.250] we're
[00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:31.350] just
[00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.490] going
[00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.550] to
[00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.710] add

[00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.970] now.
[00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.090] And
[00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:34.250] I'm
[00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.390] just
[00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:34.490] going

[00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.770] maybe
[00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.010] you
[00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:37.170] don't

[00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:38.290] class,
[00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.590] so
[00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:39.090] let's
[00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:39.270] call

[00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.310] And

[00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:10.410] here.
[00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.530] We
[00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:10.650] don't
[00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:10.850] just

[00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:13.530] We
[00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:13.670] care

[00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:14.810] you
[00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.870] know,
[00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:15.090] maybe
[00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:15.210] you
[00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:15.330] get

[00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:15.810] two
[00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:16.350] here,
[00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:16.890] but
[00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:17.030] if
[00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.210] you
[00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.590] follow
[00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.790] through
[00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.950] an

[00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:19.230] you
[00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.390] might
[00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:19.530] get
[00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:19.750] minus
[00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.990] two

[00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.010] ten.
[00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.810] And
[00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:23.030] that's
[00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.150] your
[00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.470] overall
[00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.790] reward
[00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.910] that
[00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.970] you
[00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:24.110] get
[00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.250] for
[00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:24.390] that
[00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:24.730] sequence,
[00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:24.930] that

[00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:25.470] of

[00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:26.930] process.
[00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.310] And
[00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.570] so
[00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:28.690] what
[00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:28.790] we
[00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.950] talk
[00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:29.170] about
[00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:29.350] is
[00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.730] this
[00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:30.250] quantity
[00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:30.490] called
[00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:30.610] the
[00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:30.950] return.
[00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:31.850] So
[00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.950] we
[00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:32.110] call
[00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.190] it
[00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:32.270] the
[00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:32.630] return
[00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:32.950] G.
[00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.390] That's
[00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:33.630] kind
[00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:33.730] of,
[00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:33.830] you
[00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:33.930] can
[00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:34.110] think
[00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.210] of
[00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:34.350] as
[00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.570] the
[00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:34.890] goal.
[00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:35.530] The
[00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:35.750] goal
[00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.870] of
[00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:36.310] reinforcement
[00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.610] learning
[00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:36.750] is
[00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:36.870] to
[00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.250] maximize
[00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.470] the
[00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.810] return.
[00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:38.390] So
[00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:38.590] G
[00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.810] sort
[00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.910] of
[00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.130] stands
[00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:39.270] for
[00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:39.510] goal
[00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:39.730] here.
[00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.110] And
[00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.230] the
[00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.470] goal
[00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.710] here,
[00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:41.970] the,
[00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:42.130] the
[00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:42.490] return
[00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:42.970] is
[00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:43.250] the
[00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.690] reward
[00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.410] summed
[00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:44.650] over
[00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:45.010] all
[00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:45.110] of
[00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.230] the
[00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.450] time
[00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:45.870] steps
[00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.610] infinitely
[00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:46.890] into
[00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:47.030] the
[00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.330] future
[00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.390] and
[00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:48.490] the
[00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:48.610] way
[00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:48.730] that
[00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:48.830] we
[00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:49.230] control
[00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.430] this
[00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.830] return
[00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:50.210] and
[00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.410] make
[00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:50.690] it
[00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:51.370] finite
[00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:51.950] is
[00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:52.090] by
[00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:52.290] using
[00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:52.430] a

[00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:53.070] factor.
[00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.290] So
[00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:53.410] we
[00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:53.710] basically
[00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:54.070] say,
[00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:54.610] we're
[00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:54.710] going
[00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.870] to
[00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.350] discount
[00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.610] by
[00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.770] a

[00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:56.690] at
[00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:56.890] each

[00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.370] step
[00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:57.570] going
[00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:57.710] into
[00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.830] the
[00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:58.090] future.
[00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.750] So
[00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:58.950] again,
[00:15:59.010 --> 00:15:59.050] to
[00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.150] get

[00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:02.790] and
[00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.890] then
[00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:03.270] we're
[00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:03.290] going
[00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.350] to

[00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.870] Okay,
[00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:14.110] and
[00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.330] that's
[00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:14.410] going

[00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:17.030] Yeah,
[00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.290] question.
[00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:19.650] There's
[00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:19.790] no
[00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.270] expectation
[00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:20.450] here.
[00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:20.590] That's
[00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:20.650] a
[00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:20.750] good
[00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.990] question.
[00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:21.170] Why
[00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:21.270] is
[00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:21.350] there
[00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.470] no
[00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.850] expectation
[00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:22.170] here?
[00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.750] There's
[00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:22.910] no
[00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.310] expectation
[00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:23.550] here
[00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.730] because
[00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:23.930] we're
[00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:24.110] just
[00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.370] talking
[00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:24.570] about
[00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:24.750] a
[00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:24.990] random
[00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.390] sample
[00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:25.550] at
[00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.630] the
[00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:25.890] moment.
[00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:26.390] So
[00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:26.570] G
[00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:26.710] is
[00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:27.050] random.
[00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.890] G
[00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:28.230] is
[00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.450] just
[00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:28.750] one
[00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.210] sample
[00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.730] from
[00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:29.910] our
[00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:30.190] markup
[00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:30.430] reward
[00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.970] process,
[00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.570] all
[00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:32.070] the
[00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:32.450] rewards
[00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:32.590] that
[00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.690] we
[00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:32.910] get
[00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:33.150] going
[00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.350] through
[00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.630] that,
[00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:33.970] that
[00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:34.450] sequence.
[00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:35.150] Later,
[00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.450] in
[00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:35.530] a
[00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:35.670] couple
[00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.790] of
[00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.090] slides,
[00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:36.310] we'll,
[00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:36.450] we'll
[00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:36.610] look
[00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:36.670] at,
[00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:36.850] we'll
[00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:37.110] introduce
[00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.270] the
[00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:37.710] expectation,
[00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:37.970] which
[00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:38.070] is
[00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.170] what
[00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:38.270] we
[00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:38.490] actually
[00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:38.690] care
[00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:38.930] about.
[00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:40.650] So
[00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:40.830] this
[00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:41.170] discount
[00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:41.490] factor
[00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:41.750] then
[00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.250] has
[00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:42.350] to
[00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.430] be
[00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.650] something
[00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.970] between
[00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:43.250] zero
[00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:43.410] and
[00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:43.650] one.
[00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.170] And
[00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:44.270] it
[00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:44.490] tells
[00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:44.690] us,
[00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.830] if
[00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:44.910] you
[00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.090] like,
[00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:45.250] the
[00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:45.550] present
[00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.950] value
[00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:46.130] of
[00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:46.410] future
[00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:46.750] rewards.
[00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:46.910] It
[00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:47.070] tells
[00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:47.170] you
[00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:47.310] how
[00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:47.510] much
[00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:47.650] I
[00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:47.850] care
[00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:48.250] now
[00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:48.750] about
[00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.130] rewards
[00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:49.270] I'll
[00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:49.450] get
[00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:49.570] in
[00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:49.670] the
[00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.910] future.
[00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:50.910] So
[00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.030] it
[00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.190] kind
[00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:51.290] of
[00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.470] tells
[00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.610] me
[00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:51.730] that
[00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:51.850] if
[00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:52.010] I'm
[00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:52.130] at
[00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:52.350] time
[00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.550] step
[00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.950] ten,
[00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:53.430] and
[00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.530] I
[00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:53.670] know
[00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.790] I'm
[00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:53.870] going
[00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.910] to
[00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:54.030] get
[00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.110] a
[00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.450] reward
[00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:54.610] at
[00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:54.810] time
[00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:55.010] step
[00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:55.410] 20,
[00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.910] then
[00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:56.010] I
[00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:56.170] should
[00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:56.310] get,
[00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:56.690] discount
[00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:57.030] that
[00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.210] an
[00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:57.470] additional
[00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.750] ten
[00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.190] times.
[00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.730] That's
[00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.930] ten
[00:16:58.930 --> 00:16:59.170] time
[00:16:59.170 --> 00:16:59.390] steps
[00:16:59.390 --> 00:16:59.550] into
[00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.670] the
[00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.930] future,
[00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.110] so
[00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.270] we're
[00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:00.290] going
[00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.350] to
[00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.630] discount
[00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:00.890] ten
[00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:01.030] more
[00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.370] times.
[00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:03.510] So
[00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:03.950] this
[00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.110] thing
[00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.270] has
[00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.350] to
[00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.450] be
[00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:04.670] between
[00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:04.890] zero
[00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:05.030] and
[00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.250] one.
[00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:05.990] And
[00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.250] zero
[00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:06.530] kind
[00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.650] of
[00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:06.890] means
[00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:07.630] maximally
[00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:08.170] short
[00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:08.590]-sighted.
[00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:08.790] Like
[00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:08.890] if
[00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:08.950] you
[00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:09.050] have
[00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:09.150] a
[00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.390] discount
[00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.730] factor
[00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:09.870] of
[00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:10.090] zero,
[00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.590] you
[00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.910] basically
[00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:11.250] zero
[00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:11.470] out
[00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.930] anything
[00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.350] beyond
[00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.530] your
[00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:12.770] current
[00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.010] time
[00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.290] step.
[00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.530] And
[00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:13.630] you
[00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.810] only
[00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:14.010] look
[00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:14.090] at
[00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.210] that
[00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.470] first
[00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.750] reward.
[00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.350] And
[00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.450] if
[00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:15.530] you
[00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:15.630] have
[00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.730] a
[00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:15.990] discount
[00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.330] factor
[00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:16.470] of
[00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.650] one,
[00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.910] that's
[00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.350] maximally
[00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.630] far
[00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.110]-sighted,
[00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.550] where
[00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:18.650] you
[00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.810] care
[00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:19.030] about
[00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:19.290] all
[00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:19.630] rewards
[00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.910] going
[00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:20.290] infinitely
[00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:20.570] far
[00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:20.710] into
[00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.830] the
[00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:21.110] future.
[00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.710] And
[00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.830] you
[00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:22.030] just
[00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:22.390] assume
[00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.530] that
[00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:22.650] your
[00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:22.890] Markov
[00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:23.190] process
[00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:23.390] has
[00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.510] the
[00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.770] property
[00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:24.010] that
[00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:24.450] eventually
[00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:24.730] these
[00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:24.930] things
[00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:25.090] will
[00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:25.390] all
[00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.410] be
[00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:26.710] finite,
[00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:26.970] that
[00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:27.090] you'll
[00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:27.250] get
[00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:27.510] zero.
[00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:27.810] Like
[00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:27.890] in
[00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.970] our
[00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:28.290] absorbing
[00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:28.630] terminal
[00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.950] state,
[00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:29.070] you
[00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.190] just
[00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.310] get
[00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.510] zero,
[00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:29.730] zero,
[00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.010] zero
[00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.950] at
[00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:31.050] the
[00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:31.230] end.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.100] Okay,
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:33.700] so
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.160] specifically
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.360] the
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.600] value
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:34.740] of
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.000] receiving
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.320] reward
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:35.700] R,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:36.400] K
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:36.600] plus
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:36.840] one
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.100] time
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:37.320] steps
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:37.700] later,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.060] is
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.240] gamma
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:38.360] to
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:38.440] the
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:38.680] KR.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:39.200] We'll
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:39.300] just
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:39.500] keep
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.560] discounting
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:40.760] again
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:40.860] and
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.020] again.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:41.340] Yes?
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:41.340] Does
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:41.380] the
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:41.700] discount
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.020] factor
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.480] apply
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:42.820] outside
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.040] of
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:43.440] problems,
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:43.960] like
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.100] financial
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.080] problems?
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.320] Okay,
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.060] I'm
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.080] going
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:47.140] to
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:47.400] have
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:47.500] a
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:47.680] slide
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:47.800] on
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:47.940] this.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.120] Okay,
[00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.590] so
[00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.670] really,
[00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.950] why
[00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:55.250] should
[00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.350] we
[00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.510] do
[00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.710] this?
[00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:55.890] It's
[00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:56.210] basically,
[00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:56.950] we're
[00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:57.150] somehow
[00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:57.670] introducing
[00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:58.210] a
[00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:58.650] judgment
[00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.090] here,
[00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.630] which
[00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.810] is
[00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.990] that
[00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.230] we
[00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.950] prefer
[00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:01.570] short
[00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:01.770]-term
[00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:02.170] reward
[00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:02.830] to
[00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:03.750] delayed
[00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.090] reward.
[00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:04.290] We
[00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:04.570] prefer
[00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:04.890] reward
[00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.090] now
[00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.230] to
[00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.470] reward
[00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.790] later.
[00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.550] And
[00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:06.650] the
[00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.890] amount
[00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:07.010] that
[00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.110] we
[00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.450] prefer
[00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:07.790] reward
[00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:08.010] now
[00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:08.210] to
[00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.470] reward
[00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.810] later
[00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:09.510] is
[00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.730] given
[00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:10.070] by
[00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.470] gamma.
[00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:10.770] So
[00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:10.890] the
[00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.110] closer
[00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.250] it
[00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:11.390] is
[00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.510] to
[00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.750] zero,
[00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.270] the
[00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.510] more
[00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.670] we
[00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:12.970] prefer
[00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:13.490] reward
[00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.790] now.
[00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:14.110] And
[00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.190] the
[00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:14.370] closer
[00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:14.470] it
[00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.570] is
[00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.670] to
[00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:14.930] one,
[00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:15.330] the
[00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:15.490] more
[00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:15.750] indifferent
[00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.970] we
[00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:16.130] are
[00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.210] to
[00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:16.370] when
[00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.550] those
[00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:16.830] rewards
[00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.110] arrive.
[00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:18.450] So
[00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:18.710] why
[00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.870] should
[00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.010] that
[00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.170] be?
[00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.330] That
[00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:19.430] was
[00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.710] essentially
[00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.870] the
[00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:20.110] question.
[00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:20.310] Why
[00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.430] should
[00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.530] we
[00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:20.670] do
[00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:20.910] that?
[00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.670] So
[00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.030] I'm
[00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:22.070] going
[00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.090] to
[00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:22.270] turn
[00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:22.410] that
[00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:22.530] over
[00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:22.650] to
[00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:22.750] the
[00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.090] audience.
[00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:23.590] So
[00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.190] in
[00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:24.410] most
[00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:24.550] of
[00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:24.930] reinforcement
[00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:25.270] learning,
[00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:25.910] we
[00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:26.730] use
[00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:26.830] a
[00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.090] discount
[00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.470] factor.
[00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.650] So
[00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.750] I
[00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.870] just
[00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.990] want
[00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.070] to
[00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.230] ask
[00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.350] you
[00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.510] guys,
[00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:28.670] well,
[00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:28.890] why?
[00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:29.050] Why
[00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:29.190] should
[00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.270] we
[00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.370] do
[00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:29.650] this?
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:31.980] Anyone
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.240] think
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:32.360] of
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:32.700] reasons?
[00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.830] Okay,
[00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:36.150] great.
[00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.330] So
[00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:36.550] someone
[00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:36.790] said
[00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:36.930] there's
[00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:37.130] more
[00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.590] uncertainty
[00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.790] into
[00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:37.890] the
[00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:38.090] future.
[00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:38.230] I
[00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.350] think
[00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:38.530] that's
[00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:38.610] a
[00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:38.710] really
[00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.990] great
[00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.290] answer,
[00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:39.550] actually.
[00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:41.330] So
[00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.730] one
[00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.030] reason
[00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:42.230] to
[00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.510] use
[00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.750] a
[00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:42.970] discount
[00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:43.450] factor
[00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:44.230] is
[00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.370] to
[00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:44.650] basically
[00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:45.050] represent
[00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:45.290] the
[00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:45.430] fact
[00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.530] that
[00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:45.630] we
[00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.830] do
[00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:46.030] not
[00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:46.250] have
[00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.350] a
[00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.630] perfect
[00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.950] model.
[00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.370] So
[00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:47.490] if
[00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:47.550] you
[00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:47.770] imagine
[00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:47.910] that
[00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.050] we're
[00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:48.170] just
[00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:48.590] building
[00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.730] a
[00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:48.990] Markov
[00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.330] process
[00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:49.570] to
[00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:49.790] model
[00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:49.930] the
[00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:50.250] environment,
[00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.510] we're
[00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.710] building
[00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.090] this
[00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:51.570] Markov
[00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:51.770] reward
[00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.230] process.
[00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:52.970] But
[00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:53.050] we
[00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:53.210] don't
[00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.390] have
[00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.490] a
[00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:53.790] perfect
[00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:53.990] model
[00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.110] of
[00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.190] the
[00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.530] environment.
[00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:56.170] So
[00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:56.490] we
[00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:56.710] think
[00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.870] we've
[00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.990] come
[00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.110] up
[00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.210] with
[00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:57.470] some
[00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.970] great
[00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:58.250] plan.
[00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.410] We
[00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:58.770] think
[00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:58.910] we
[00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:59.030] know
[00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.310] exactly
[00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.470] how
[00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.590] much
[00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.770] reward
[00:18:59.770 --> 00:18:59.930] we're
[00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:00.010] going
[00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.030] to
[00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:00.130] get
[00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:00.230] into
[00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.350] the
[00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.590] future.
[00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:01.490] But
[00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.630] if
[00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.730] we
[00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:01.910] don't
[00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.350] entirely
[00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:02.730] trust
[00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.250] our
[00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:03.710] decisions
[00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:04.050] that
[00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:04.170] we
[00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:04.370] make,
[00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.510] if
[00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.590] we
[00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.750] don't
[00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.090] entirely
[00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.530] trust
[00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:05.650] our
[00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.090] evaluations,
[00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:06.870] we
[00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.090] might
[00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:07.370] choose
[00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.530] to
[00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:07.930] discount.
[00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.470] Because
[00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.810] we
[00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.990] might
[00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.210] say,
[00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:09.490] okay,
[00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:09.850] well,
[00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:10.010] maybe
[00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.130] I
[00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.230] can
[00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:10.410] take
[00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:10.550] this
[00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:10.690] pot
[00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:10.810] of
[00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:10.990] gold
[00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.350] now.
[00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.870] Or
[00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:12.110] maybe
[00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.270] I
[00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.410] should
[00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:12.710] really
[00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.970] trust
[00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:13.130] my
[00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.410] plan
[00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:13.510] and
[00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.630] my
[00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.850] model
[00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.190] that's
[00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.310] going
[00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.390] to
[00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.550] tell
[00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:14.670] me
[00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:14.790] that
[00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:14.930] all
[00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:15.070] these
[00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.270] things
[00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.370] are
[00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:15.430] going
[00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.510] to
[00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.750] happen
[00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.930] over
[00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:16.070] the
[00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.210] next
[00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:16.410] ten
[00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:16.590] years
[00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.730] and
[00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.850] then
[00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.950] I'll
[00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:17.030] get
[00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:17.150] an
[00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.250] even
[00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:17.510] bigger
[00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.730] pot
[00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:17.870] of
[00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:18.090] gold.
[00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:18.930] Well,
[00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.330] you
[00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:19.450] have
[00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:19.570] to
[00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:19.770] really
[00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.010] trust
[00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:20.150] your
[00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.370] model
[00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:20.550] to
[00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:20.750] wait
[00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.910] all
[00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.070] those
[00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.530] time
[00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:21.830] steps
[00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.110] and
[00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.470] really
[00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.990] believe
[00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.170] that
[00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:23.670] things
[00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:23.770] are
[00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:23.850] going
[00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:23.910] to
[00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:24.090] turn
[00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:24.210] out
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:24.390] just
[00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.510] as
[00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.610] you
[00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:24.950] planned
[00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:25.410] in
[00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:25.550] order
[00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:25.710] to
[00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.850] get
[00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:26.010] that
[00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:26.210] bigger
[00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.410] pot
[00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:26.530] of
[00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:26.650] gold
[00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:26.990] later.
[00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:27.850] So
[00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:28.290] uncertainty,
[00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:28.570] I
[00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:28.710] think,
[00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.830] is
[00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.050] really
[00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:29.270] one
[00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.350] of
[00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.470] the
[00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.730] major
[00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:29.990] kind
[00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.070] of
[00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.370] intuitive
[00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:30.790] reasons
[00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.070] to
[00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.570] discount.
[00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:32.290] Any
[00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:32.450] other
[00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.730] points?
[00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:32.930] Any
[00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:33.090] other
[00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:33.410] ideas?
[00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:34.430] Yeah.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:49.820] Right.
[00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:52.350] Okay,
[00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.750] absolutely.
[00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:53.050] So
[00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:53.390] to
[00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.650] keep
[00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.070] the
[00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.330] maths
[00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:54.710] bounded.
[00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:54.930] I
[00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:55.050] mean,
[00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.150] and
[00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:55.450] actually,
[00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:56.690] so
[00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.950] I'll
[00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:57.070] do
[00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.210] my
[00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:57.510] first
[00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.970] couple
[00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:58.070] of
[00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.350] slides
[00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.510] here.
[00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:59.070] So
[00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.310] I
[00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.610] mean,
[00:19:59.610 --> 00:19:59.730] the
[00:19:59.730 --> 00:19:59.890] first
[00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:00.090] reason
[00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:00.190] is
[00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.390] just
[00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.850] mathematically
[00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.410] convenient.
[00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:01.910] And
[00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:02.030] I
[00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:02.190] think,
[00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.690] honestly,
[00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:02.950] that's
[00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.050] the
[00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:03.190] main
[00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.430] reason
[00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.550] we
[00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:03.710] do
[00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.870] it
[00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.110] in
[00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.470] the
[00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.830] MDP
[00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:05.270] framework
[00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.430] for
[00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.690] RL.
[00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:06.490] Most
[00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:06.610] of
[00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:06.650] the
[00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.830] time,
[00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:06.990] it's
[00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.150] just
[00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:07.370] because
[00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.510] the
[00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.710] maths
[00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.850] all
[00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:08.090] works
[00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.250] out.
[00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.410] It's
[00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:08.590] easy
[00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.750] to
[00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.990] teach.
[00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.150] It's
[00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.290] easy
[00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:09.470] to
[00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.850] understand.
[00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:11.570] And
[00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.930] it
[00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:12.230] avoids
[00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.430] these
[00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.750] infinite
[00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:13.190] returns.
[00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:13.690] So
[00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:13.790] if
[00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:13.890] you
[00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:14.050] have
[00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:14.250] some
[00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:14.670] cycle
[00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:14.830] in
[00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:15.390] your
[00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.690] Markov
[00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.190] process,
[00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:17.610] and
[00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:18.050] you
[00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:18.210] just
[00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:18.410] get
[00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:18.810] rewards
[00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:19.030] again
[00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:19.170] and
[00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:19.330] again
[00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:19.470] and
[00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.670] again
[00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:19.810] and
[00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:20.030] again,
[00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.630] you
[00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.990] need
[00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.190] some
[00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.530] mechanism
[00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:21.730] to
[00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:22.070] avoid
[00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.630] infinity
[00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.910] as
[00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:23.210] your
[00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.010] evaluation.
[00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.450] Otherwise,
[00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:25.050] the
[00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:25.310] maths
[00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.450] just
[00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:25.630] doesn't
[00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.830] work
[00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.970] out.
[00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:26.390] And
[00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.530] there
[00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:26.710] are
[00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.870] other
[00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:27.230] mechanisms
[00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.450] for
[00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:27.650] dealing
[00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:27.810] with
[00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:27.950] that,
[00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.090] which
[00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:28.210] we'll
[00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:28.450] mention
[00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:28.790] briefly.
[00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.590] We
[00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.750] have
[00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.850] the
[00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:31.330] uncertainty.
[00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:32.910] And
[00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:32.970] I
[00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:33.070] just
[00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.190] wanted
[00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.270] to
[00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.410] add
[00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:33.490] in
[00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:33.590] a
[00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.710] couple
[00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.830] of
[00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.990] other
[00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.390] ideas.
[00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:35.050] So
[00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:35.450] someone
[00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.770] mentioned
[00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:36.130] already
[00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.730] the
[00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:36.950] idea
[00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:37.150] that
[00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:37.330] in
[00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:37.830] financial
[00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.230] settings,
[00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.450] it's
[00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.650] rather
[00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.110] natural.
[00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:39.650] So
[00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.970] that's
[00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:40.070] a
[00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.230] quite
[00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.610] specific
[00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.970] setting.
[00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:41.250] But
[00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:41.690] in
[00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:41.810] a
[00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:42.150] financial
[00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:42.630] setting,
[00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:43.510] we
[00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.650] have
[00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:43.810] this
[00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.070] idea
[00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.390] of
[00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.790] interest
[00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.110] rates,
[00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:45.270] that
[00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.350] you
[00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.510] kind
[00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.590] of
[00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.830] know
[00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:46.050] that
[00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:46.490] money
[00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.770] now
[00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:46.950] is
[00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:47.250] worth
[00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:47.850] more
[00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:47.990] than
[00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.190] money
[00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.490] later.
[00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:48.650] And
[00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.810] that's
[00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:49.050] usually
[00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:49.370] built
[00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.570] into
[00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:49.750] the
[00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.050] definition
[00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:50.250] of
[00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:50.370] what
[00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:50.470] it
[00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.670] means
[00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:50.850] to
[00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:51.030] kind
[00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.170] of
[00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:51.890] make
[00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:52.670] financial
[00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.130] decisions
[00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:53.390] or
[00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.830] trading
[00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.450] in
[00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:54.530] the
[00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:54.730] trading
[00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:55.010] system
[00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.130] or
[00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.430] whatever.
[00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.090] So
[00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.490] that's
[00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:57.930] a
[00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:58.230] specific
[00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.530] case
[00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:58.670] where
[00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:58.810] there's
[00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:59.010] really
[00:20:59.010 --> 00:20:59.250] a
[00:20:59.250 --> 00:20:59.610] meaning
[00:20:59.610 --> 00:20:59.810] to
[00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.990] this,
[00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.130] that
[00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.210] you
[00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:00.330] can
[00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:00.490] think
[00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:00.610] of
[00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:00.810] gamma
[00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:00.970] as
[00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:01.150] like
[00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:01.350] the
[00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.690] inverse
[00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:01.830] of
[00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.930] the
[00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:02.190] interest
[00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.450] rate.
[00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:04.210] But
[00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:04.370] one
[00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.570] more
[00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:04.770] point
[00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:04.870] I
[00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.970] just
[00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:05.110] want
[00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.210] to
[00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.390] make
[00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.530] is
[00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:06.010] that,
[00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.390] actually,
[00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:07.010] animals
[00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.190] and
[00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.550] humans,
[00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:07.830] they
[00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:08.070] actually
[00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.350] show
[00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.470] a
[00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.750] preference
[00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.930] for
[00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:09.150] immediate
[00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:09.410] reward.
[00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.610] So
[00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:09.810] people
[00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:09.930] have
[00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:10.090] done
[00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:10.470] tests
[00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.650] on
[00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:11.010] humans.
[00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:11.450] And
[00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.530] it
[00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:11.730] turns
[00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:11.970] out
[00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:12.210] that
[00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:12.550] the
[00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:12.830] humans
[00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:13.050] have
[00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:13.210] not
[00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:13.470] quite
[00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.930] an
[00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:14.310] exponential
[00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.950] discounting,
[00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:15.090] but
[00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:15.190] they
[00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.310] have
[00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.530] something
[00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:15.710] like
[00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.790] a
[00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:16.210] hyperbolic
[00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:16.810] discounting.
[00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.790] But
[00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:18.070] certainly,
[00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:18.430] animals
[00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.590] and
[00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.790] humans
[00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.030] do
[00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:19.350] prefer
[00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.510] to
[00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.630] get
[00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.910] reward
[00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:20.090] now
[00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.230] than
[00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.470] reward
[00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.730] later.
[00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:20.910] And
[00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:21.010] so
[00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:21.110] you
[00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.210] can
[00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:21.390] think
[00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.490] of
[00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:21.650] this
[00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.770] as
[00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:21.930] a
[00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.210] cognitive
[00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:22.590] model
[00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.790] as
[00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.370] well
[00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:23.790] of
[00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:24.470] how
[00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:25.110] biological
[00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.630] decision
[00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:25.930] making
[00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:26.990] operates.
[00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:28.450] And
[00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:28.690] finally,
[00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:28.790] I
[00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:28.910] just
[00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:29.030] wanted
[00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:29.170] to
[00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:29.390] mention
[00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.610] that
[00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:29.770] if
[00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:29.930] you
[00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:30.910] don't
[00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:31.150] agree
[00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:31.290] with
[00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:31.450] these
[00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:31.730] points,
[00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:31.930] which
[00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:32.030] I
[00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:32.170] think
[00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:32.290] is
[00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:32.570] perfectly
[00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:33.010] legitimate
[00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:33.250] to
[00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:33.430] say,
[00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.550] well,
[00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:33.730] hey,
[00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.950] look,
[00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:34.210] the
[00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:34.570] problem
[00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:34.770] I
[00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:34.910] care
[00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:35.190] about
[00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.650] really
[00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.630] is
[00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.990] artificial
[00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.230] to
[00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.530] introduce
[00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:37.650] a
[00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:37.930] discount
[00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:38.230] factor.
[00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.370] I'm
[00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:38.550] only
[00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:38.830] doing
[00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.010] it
[00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:39.350] to
[00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.510] make
[00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.610] it
[00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:39.950] convenient.
[00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:40.770] There
[00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:40.930] are
[00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.370] alternatives,
[00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:41.690] and
[00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:42.210] there's
[00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:42.970] undiscounted
[00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:43.270] Markov
[00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.510] reward
[00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.010] processes.
[00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:44.930] The
[00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:45.190] simplest
[00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.490] case
[00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:45.830] being
[00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.050] where
[00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:47.430] we
[00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.610] know
[00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:47.750] that
[00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.910] all
[00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:48.270] sequences
[00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:48.850] terminate.
[00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:49.310] So
[00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.410] if
[00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:49.490] we
[00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:49.610] go
[00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.830] back
[00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.010] to
[00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:50.250] our
[00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.010] student
[00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.150] MRP,
[00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:52.290] we
[00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:52.470] know
[00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.630] that
[00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.970] all
[00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:53.430] sequences
[00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.690] ended
[00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.990] up
[00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.190] with,
[00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:54.830] at
[00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:55.030] some
[00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:55.310] point,
[00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:55.950] falling
[00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:56.290] asleep,
[00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:56.990] one
[00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.130] way
[00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:57.230] or
[00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.430] another.
[00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:58.010] And
[00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.090] so
[00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:58.170] if
[00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:58.270] we
[00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:58.390] know
[00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.590] that's
[00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.690] the
[00:21:58.690 --> 00:21:59.010] case,
[00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.410] then
[00:21:59.410 --> 00:21:59.630] all
[00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.990] sequences
[00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.390] end,
[00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.190] or
[00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.310] at
[00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.450] least
[00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:01.690] end
[00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:01.770] in
[00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:01.910] this
[00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:02.230] absorbing
[00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.590] terminal
[00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.890] state,
[00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:03.050] which
[00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:03.250] keeps
[00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:03.430] getting
[00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.650] zero
[00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:03.790] and
[00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:03.950] zero
[00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:04.090] and
[00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:04.230] zero
[00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.550] again.
[00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:05.010] And
[00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:05.230] therefore,
[00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.430] by
[00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.970] definition,
[00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.910] all
[00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:07.390] returns
[00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.750] are
[00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.070] finite.
[00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:09.410] And
[00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:09.710] so
[00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:10.190] then
[00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.370] it's
[00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.650] fine.
[00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:11.570] There's
[00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.770] also
[00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:11.950] a
[00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:12.290] formulation
[00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:12.530] that's
[00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:12.630] in
[00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.770] the
[00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.130] extended
[00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.530] notes
[00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:13.710] for
[00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.850] this
[00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:14.170] class,
[00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.350] which
[00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.450] is
[00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.570] the
[00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.810] average
[00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:15.150] reward
[00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:15.630] formulation.
[00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.290] And
[00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:16.470] there
[00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.630] it's
[00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.870] possible,
[00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.190] even
[00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.490] with
[00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:17.870] infinite
[00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:18.290] sequences,
[00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:18.490] to
[00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:18.890] still
[00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:19.170] deal
[00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:19.310] with
[00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.410] the
[00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:20.270] undiscounted
[00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.890] sort
[00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.990] of
[00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.470] evaluation
[00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.970] of
[00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:23.230] Markov
[00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.610] processes,
[00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:24.070] Markov
[00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.270] reward
[00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:24.690] processes,
[00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.270] and
[00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.930] MDPs.
[00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:26.830] But
[00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.070] just
[00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.230] to
[00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.550] clarify,
[00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.330] not
[00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:28.570] all
[00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.050] sequences
[00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:29.690] terminate
[00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.830] in
[00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.970] the
[00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:30.310] example
[00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.490] you
[00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:30.670] have,
[00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:30.830] but
[00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.830] very
[00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.950] few
[00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:32.570] sequences
[00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.830] that
[00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:33.030] need
[00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:33.270] not
[00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.470] end
[00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.630] up
[00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.810] in
[00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:33.930] this.
[00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.030] No,
[00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.210] that's
[00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.370] not
[00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:35.550] true.
[00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:35.910] So
[00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:36.350] any
[00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:39.390] single
[00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.810] sample
[00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:40.390] which
[00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.550] you
[00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:40.850] draw
[00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:41.330] from
[00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.490] this
[00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:41.770] Markov
[00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:42.110] process,
[00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:42.390] by
[00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.790] definition,
[00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.230] is
[00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.530] finite,
[00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:43.910] a
[00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:44.130] finite
[00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:44.430] length.
[00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:44.750] I
[00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.750] mean,
[00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:44.910] I
[00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:45.170] can't,
[00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.450] there
[00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:45.650] isn't
[00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:45.850] some
[00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:46.150] part
[00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:46.270] of
[00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:46.430] that
[00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.910] process
[00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:47.110] where
[00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.230] I
[00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.330] could
[00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.490] just
[00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:47.630] end
[00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.770] up
[00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:47.930] in
[00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:48.050] an
[00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:48.230] infinite
[00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.510] loop.
[00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:50.470] So
[00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.910] any
[00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.290] sample
[00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:51.490] which
[00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:51.590] you
[00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.890] draw,
[00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:53.230] there
[00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.430] is,
[00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.070] so
[00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.010] it's
[00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:56.350] impossible
[00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.570] to
[00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:56.750] draw
[00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.910] a
[00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:57.190] sample
[00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.450] that's
[00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:57.710] infinite.
[00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:58.030] Like
[00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:58.210] by
[00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:58.570] definition,
[00:22:58.690 --> 00:22:58.770] the
[00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:58.990] sample
[00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.130] that
[00:22:59.130 --> 00:22:59.190] you
[00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.350] draw
[00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.550] will
[00:22:59.550 --> 00:22:59.950] terminate
[00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:00.050] at
[00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:00.210] some
[00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:00.490] point.
[00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.570] That's
[00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:01.670] the
[00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:01.970] definition
[00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:02.110] of
[00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.210] this
[00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.570] process.
[00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:03.390] And
[00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.630] so,
[00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:04.250] even
[00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.610] though
[00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:05.250] the
[00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:05.710] decision
[00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:06.050] process
[00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:06.490] itself
[00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:06.930] contains
[00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:07.250] infinite
[00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.550] loops,
[00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.010] any
[00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:08.290] single
[00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:08.570] sample
[00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.710] that
[00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.770] you
[00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:08.890] draw
[00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:09.030] will
[00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:09.130] be
[00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.230] a
[00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.450] finite
[00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:09.710] length
[00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.830] and
[00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.950] will
[00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:10.370] terminate.
[00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:10.710] And
[00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.790] the
[00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:10.910] only
[00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:11.130] question
[00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:11.290] is,
[00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.410] at
[00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:11.590] what
[00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.830] step
[00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.930] it
[00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:12.030] will
[00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.390] terminate.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:17.700] Okay,
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:19.740] right,
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:19.920] so
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.060] now
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:20.300] someone
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:20.460] asked
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:20.620] about
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.160] expectations.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:21.620] And
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:21.720] so
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:21.860] this
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.080] brings
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.220] us
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:22.300] to
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:22.420] the
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:22.620] value
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:22.860] function,
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.060] which
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.160] is
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.380] really
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:23.540] the
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:23.780] central
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.140] quantity
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:24.300] which
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:24.400] we're
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.620] interested
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.000] in
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.860] in
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.120] RL.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:26.840] So
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:26.940] the
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:27.160] value
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:27.480] function,
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:27.660] this
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:27.820] is
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.040] the
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.320] quantity
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:29.500] we
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:29.720] really
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:29.920] care
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.200] about.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:30.760] It's
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:30.900] the
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.120] long
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.340] term
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:31.660] value
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:31.800] of
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:31.980] being
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.080] in
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.180] a
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:32.420] state.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:32.980] So
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.080] if
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.160] you're
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:33.260] in
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:33.400] this
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:33.620] state
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:33.940] S,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.100] so
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:34.220] if
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:34.300] you're
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:34.400] in
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:34.580] some
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:34.920] concrete
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.240] state
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:35.580] S,
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:36.560] how
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:36.760] much
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.200] value
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:37.820] will
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:37.920] you
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.060] get
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:38.240] from
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:38.400] there
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:38.520] on?
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:38.760] What's
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:38.860] the
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:39.100] total
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:39.560] reward
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:39.860] that
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:39.980] you'll
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:40.120] get
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:40.300] from
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:40.460] that
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:40.740] state
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:40.980] onwards?
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.020] So
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:42.400] formally,
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.000] it's
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.180] just
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:43.360] the
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:43.760] expected
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.240] return
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:44.540] if
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:44.640] you
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:44.920] start
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.040] in
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:45.200] that
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.520] state.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:45.840] So
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:45.940] if
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:46.040] I
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.260] drop
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:46.420] you
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:46.640] into
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:46.880] this
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.160] Markov
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:47.400] reward
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:47.840] process
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.320] in
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:48.520] some
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:48.860] state,
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.040] like
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:49.160] if
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:49.240] I
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:49.420] drop
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:49.540] you
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:49.680] in
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:49.940] class
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.260] two,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.200] how
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.420] much
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:51.940] reward
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.100] will
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.160] you
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:52.300] get
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:52.440] from
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:52.700] class
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.020] two
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:53.320] to
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:53.440] the
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:53.620] end
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:53.920] until
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.060] you
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:54.740] terminate?
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:54.980] That's
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.240] basically
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:55.400] what
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:55.540] it's
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:55.720] saying.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:56.460] How
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:56.620] much
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:56.860] reward
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:56.980] will
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:57.060] you
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.180] get
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:57.340] from
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:57.500] then
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:57.740] onwards?
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:58.800] And
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:58.920] we
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.040] have
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.180] this
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:23:59.740] expectation
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:00.820] because
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.820] the
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.140] environment
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.380] is
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:02.960] stochastic.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:03.420] We're
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:03.520] in
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:03.660] this
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:04.200] stochastic
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:04.820] Markov
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.340] process.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.140] The
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:06.640] evolution
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:06.800] of
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.160] states
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:07.560] might
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.100] go
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.280] one
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:08.400] way
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:08.600] one
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.660] episode
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:09.880] and
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.300] another
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:10.440] way
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:10.540] the
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:10.740] next
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.120] episode.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:11.660] What
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:11.780] we
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:11.940] care
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.180] about
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:12.340] is
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:12.440] the
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:12.820] expected
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.260] return
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:13.500] over
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:13.680] all
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:13.800] of
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.060] those
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:14.460] different
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:14.840] episodes.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:15.580] And
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:15.780] that's
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:15.880] the
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.080] value.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:16.320] That's
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.440] how
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:16.620] good
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:16.700] it
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:16.840] is
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:16.960] to
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.060] be
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:17.160] in
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:17.300] any
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:17.500] given
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:17.800] state.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.500] So
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:18.660] this
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:18.760] is
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:18.900] the
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.160] central
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.500] quantity.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:19.660] We
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:20.020] prefer
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:20.480] states.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:20.600] We
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:20.960] prefer
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.100] to
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:21.200] be
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:21.320] in
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:21.540] states
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:21.700] that
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:21.840] give
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:21.960] us
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.280] more
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:22.800] total
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.160] reward.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:23.860] And
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:23.940] so
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.100] the
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:24.400] formulation
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:24.800] of
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.360] our
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:25.600] problem
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:25.800] is
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:25.900] to
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.060] say,
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:26.340] let's
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:26.780] first
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:26.880] of
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:26.940] all
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:27.080] just
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.300] measure
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:27.480] that.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:27.620] So
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:27.720] in
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:27.800] an
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.140] MRP,
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:28.360] there's
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:28.600] no
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.680] concept
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:29.840] of
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.380] maximizing.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:30.600] We're
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:30.720] just
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.020] saying,
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:31.380] let's
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:31.540] just
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:31.760] measure
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:31.960] how
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.120] much
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.380] reward
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:32.520] we'll
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:32.780] get.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.100] Like
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:33.220] when
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:33.300] we
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:33.400] get
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:33.520] to
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.040] MDPs,
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.140] we
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.300] want
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:34.420] to
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:34.720] maximize
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:34.980] this
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:35.280] quantity.
[00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.610] Okay,
[00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.070] so
[00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.230] let's
[00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.370] get
[00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:38.690] concrete
[00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.970] again.
[00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:39.150] Let's
[00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:39.230] go
[00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.410] back
[00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:39.530] to
[00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:39.830] the
[00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:40.350] student
[00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:40.790] Markov
[00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:41.110] chain,
[00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:42.130] actually
[00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:42.290] the
[00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:42.490] student
[00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:43.250] Markov
[00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.450] reward
[00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:43.850] process.
[00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.970] So
[00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:45.130] we're
[00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:45.130] going
[00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:45.210] to
[00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:45.730] sample
[00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:46.270] returns
[00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:46.570] now.
[00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.550] So
[00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:47.750] again,
[00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.930] we're
[00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.990] going
[00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.070] to
[00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.230] look
[00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.330] at
[00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:48.590] these
[00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:49.190] samples
[00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.430] of
[00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.570] this
[00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:49.970] process
[00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:50.130] that
[00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:50.310] we've
[00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.630] taken.
[00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:51.990] And
[00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.150] we're
[00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:52.190] going
[00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.210] to
[00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:52.590] consider
[00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.910] a
[00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:53.170] discount
[00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:53.590] factor
[00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.830] of
[00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:54.130] gamma
[00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:54.450] equals
[00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:54.690] 0
[00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:55.150].5.
[00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:57.250] So
[00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:57.690] basically
[00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:58.470] half
[00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.610] the
[00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.810] amount
[00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:58.930] that
[00:24:58.930 --> 00:24:59.030] we
[00:24:59.030 --> 00:24:59.250] care
[00:24:59.250 --> 00:24:59.470] about
[00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.650] getting
[00:24:59.650 --> 00:24:59.990] rewards
[00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.130] at
[00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:00.330] every
[00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:00.590] step.
[00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:01.850] And
[00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:02.010] so
[00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:02.190] this
[00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.290] is
[00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:02.410] the
[00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:02.690] definition
[00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:02.870] of
[00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.970] our
[00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:03.370] return,
[00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:04.290] with
[00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:04.530] gamma
[00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.070] instantiated
[00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.250] through
[00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:05.330] the
[00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.570] half.
[00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:06.150] And
[00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:06.230] so
[00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.390] now
[00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.490] if
[00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:06.550] we
[00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:06.730] just
[00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:06.990] look
[00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.130] at
[00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.390] the
[00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:07.830] value
[00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.970] of
[00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:08.150] these
[00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:08.490] guys.
[00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:11.130] So
[00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:11.570] these
[00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.710] are
[00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:12.070] basically
[00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.310] like
[00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.550] the
[00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.170] returns
[00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:13.430] here.
[00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.610] So
[00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:13.730] you
[00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.930] get
[00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.530] minus
[00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:15.770] 2
[00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.910] at
[00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:15.990] the
[00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.190] first
[00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.430] step,
[00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:16.710] minus
[00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:17.090] 2
[00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.270] discounted
[00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:18.370] by
[00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:18.470] a
[00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.730] half,
[00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:19.030] minus
[00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:19.350] 2
[00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.890] discounted
[00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:20.010] by
[00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:20.130] a
[00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:20.370] quarter.
[00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:21.090] And
[00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:21.210] then
[00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:21.290] at
[00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:21.370] the
[00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:21.490] end
[00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:21.570] of
[00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:21.630] it,
[00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:21.710] you
[00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.810] got
[00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:21.950] this
[00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:22.150] plus
[00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:22.410] 10
[00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:23.010] reward
[00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:23.350] for
[00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.130] finishing
[00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:24.310] the
[00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.650] class,
[00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:25.070] all
[00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.230] three
[00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.550] classes.
[00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:26.070] And
[00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.290] that's
[00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:26.710] discounted
[00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.830] by
[00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.970] an
[00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:27.190] 8.
[00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:27.670] You
[00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:27.870] sum
[00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:28.050] those
[00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.210] all
[00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:28.530] together,
[00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:29.070] you
[00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.170] get
[00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:29.430] minus
[00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.630] 2
[00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.070].25.
[00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:30.990] So
[00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.230] that's
[00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.450] one
[00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:31.810] sample
[00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:32.010] of
[00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:32.370] the
[00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:32.750] return.
[00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:33.270] So
[00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:33.470] this
[00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.630] guy
[00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.790] should
[00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.090] say
[00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:34.670] G1.
[00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:35.970] And
[00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:36.110] now
[00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.250] we've
[00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:36.350] got
[00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.570] four
[00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:36.810] different
[00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:37.210] samples
[00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:37.610] here.
[00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:38.010] These
[00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.350] are
[00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.290] different
[00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:39.710] samples
[00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.890] of
[00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:40.770] the
[00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:41.070] first
[00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.510] four
[00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.050] different
[00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:43.650] sample
[00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.310] sequences
[00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.610] through
[00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:45.810] this
[00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:46.090] Markov
[00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:46.290] reward
[00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:46.750] process.
[00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:47.270] So
[00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:47.430] what's
[00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.530] the
[00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:47.810] value
[00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.950] of
[00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:48.110] being
[00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.230] in
[00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.370] this
[00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:48.630] state?
[00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.870] What's
[00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.970] the
[00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:49.190] value
[00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.290] of
[00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:49.410] the
[00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:49.630] start
[00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.990] state?
[00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:50.870] One
[00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:51.090] way
[00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:51.270] to
[00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:51.730] estimate
[00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:51.970] it
[00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:52.090] is
[00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:52.150] you
[00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:52.270] can
[00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:52.410] just
[00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:52.670] take
[00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:52.790] a
[00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:52.990] bunch
[00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.530] of
[00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:54.250] samples
[00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:54.530] and
[00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:54.670] just
[00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:54.850] take
[00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:54.990] the
[00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.270] average
[00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:55.450] of
[00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:55.590] these
[00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.910] values.
[00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.090] And
[00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.190] that
[00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.310] would
[00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.450] give
[00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.550] you
[00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:56.650] a
[00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:56.950] legitimate
[00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:57.510] estimator
[00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.730] for
[00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:57.890] the
[00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:58.090] value
[00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:58.430] function,
[00:25:58.910 --> 00:25:59.050] the
[00:25:59.050 --> 00:25:59.250] value
[00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.370] of
[00:25:59.370 --> 00:25:59.510] that
[00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.790] state.
[00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.250] So
[00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.810] the
[00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:02.190] returns
[00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.350] are
[00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.790] samples.
[00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:03.230] They're
[00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.530] random.
[00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:03.970] But
[00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:04.090] the
[00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:04.290] value
[00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:04.590] function
[00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.870] is
[00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:05.750] not
[00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.950] a
[00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:06.110] random
[00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.490] quantity.
[00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:06.650] It's
[00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:06.730] an
[00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:07.170] expectation
[00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:07.430] over
[00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.610] these
[00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.830] random
[00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:08.290] variables.
[00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:09.850] Okay,
[00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:10.010] is
[00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.130] that
[00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.350] clear?
[00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.230] So
[00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.610] why
[00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:11.730] are
[00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:11.870] we
[00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:12.170] starting
[00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:12.610] with
[00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.150] G1
[00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:13.290] and
[00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:13.410] we
[00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:13.950] start
[00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:14.190] from
[00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.390] the
[00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.550] fifth
[00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:14.810] one?
[00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:20.130] No,
[00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:20.610] these
[00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:21.090] subscripts
[00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:21.230] are
[00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.470] time
[00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.830] steps.
[00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:23.090] So
[00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.590] G1
[00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.330] is...
[00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:25.530] So
[00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:25.710] here
[00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.850] we're
[00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:26.130] basically
[00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:26.910] saying...
[00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:27.050] So
[00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:27.370] the
[00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:27.790] definition,
[00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:28.110] we
[00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.230] go
[00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.390] back
[00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.530] to
[00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:28.750] the
[00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.370] definition
[00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:30.710] of
[00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:31.450] return.
[00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.090] The
[00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:33.410] definition
[00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:33.590] of
[00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.830] return
[00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:34.090] was
[00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:34.750] the
[00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.230] return
[00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:36.410] starting
[00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:36.570] at
[00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:36.770] time
[00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:37.470] step
[00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.770] T
[00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.250] is
[00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:38.370] the
[00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:38.750] rewards
[00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.990] from
[00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.170] that
[00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:39.390] time
[00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:39.590] step
[00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.970] onwards.
[00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.090] Okay,
[00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.810] so
[00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:41.970] now
[00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:42.150] we're
[00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:42.510] considering
[00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.070] a
[00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.270] bunch
[00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:43.390] of
[00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:43.650] different
[00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.170] returns.
[00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:46.570] We
[00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:46.830] are
[00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:47.450] also
[00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.910] starting
[00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.370] from
[00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.470] S1
[00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.690] equals
[00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:50.050] C1
[00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:50.150] in
[00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:50.330] this
[00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.630] case.
[00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:51.890] But
[00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:52.150] the
[00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.010] subscripts
[00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:54.170] are
[00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:54.850] time
[00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:55.170] steps.
[00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:56.230] And
[00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.650] they're
[00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:57.270] observed
[00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.290] quantities
[00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:58.690] here.
[00:26:58.930 --> 00:26:58.990] There's
[00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.150] no
[00:26:59.150 --> 00:26:59.690] expectations
[00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.950] because
[00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:00.410] we're
[00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.210] essentially
[00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:01.850] saying
[00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.990] that
[00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.150] we've
[00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:02.530] observed
[00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:02.950] these
[00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:03.390] sequences.
[00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:03.710] These
[00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.830] are
[00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:04.250] observed
[00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.810] samples
[00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:05.330] of
[00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.430] our
[00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.670] random
[00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:06.070] process.
[00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.550] And
[00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:06.670] if
[00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:06.750] we
[00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:07.010] want
[00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.270] to
[00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.210] ask
[00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.370] about
[00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:08.490] the
[00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:08.670] value
[00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:08.970] function
[00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:09.130] to
[00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:09.270] make
[00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:09.370] an
[00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:09.810] expectation,
[00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.130] we're
[00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.370] asking
[00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.590] what's
[00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.690] the
[00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:11.190] expected
[00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.990] return?
[00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.370] What's
[00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:12.550] the
[00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:13.070] expected
[00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.850] number
[00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:14.090] that's
[00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.170] going
[00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:14.250] to
[00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:14.430] pop
[00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.630] out
[00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.750] of
[00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.950] this
[00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:15.090] at
[00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:15.210] the
[00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:15.410] end?
[00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.010] What's
[00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.110] the
[00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.330] average
[00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:16.470] of
[00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.610] these
[00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.810] numbers?
[00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.610] And
[00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:17.810] that's
[00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.930] how
[00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:18.090] good
[00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:18.210] it
[00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:18.350] is
[00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.430] to
[00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:18.570] be
[00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:18.950] in
[00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:19.230] the
[00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.470] first
[00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.690] state
[00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.790] of
[00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:20.890] the
[00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:21.130] student
[00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:21.470] Markov
[00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.690] chain.
[00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.910] Okay,
[00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:24.650] so
[00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:25.010] what
[00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.110] does
[00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.250] this
[00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.450] look
[00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:25.730] like?
[00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.630] So
[00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.810] let's
[00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:27.110] consider
[00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.270] a
[00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:27.410] couple
[00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:27.530] of
[00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:27.830] different
[00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.270] discount
[00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:28.770] factors.
[00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.610] So
[00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:29.870] first
[00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.990] of
[00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.090] all,
[00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:30.250] this
[00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:30.370] is
[00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:30.650] the
[00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.450] maximally
[00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:31.850] short
[00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:32.290]-sighted
[00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:32.570] view
[00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.950] of
[00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:33.070] the
[00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.270] value
[00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:33.610] function.
[00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.370] So
[00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.530] this
[00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:34.630] is
[00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.750] the
[00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.990] value
[00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.330] function
[00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.630] now
[00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:36.290] for
[00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:36.430] gamma
[00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.710] equals
[00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.970] zero.
[00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.390] This
[00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:37.470] is
[00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.590] where
[00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.690] we
[00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:37.930] literally
[00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:38.170] don't
[00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:38.330] care
[00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.510] about
[00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.870] anything
[00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:39.130] except
[00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:39.430] one
[00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.670] step
[00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:39.790] of
[00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:40.030] immediate
[00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:40.370] reward.
[00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:41.110] So
[00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.190] if
[00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.270] we
[00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:41.550] take
[00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.090] any
[00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:42.410] given
[00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.430] state
[00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.650] here,
[00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:43.790] so
[00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:43.890] now
[00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:43.990] if
[00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.050] we
[00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:44.410] consider
[00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:45.430] our
[00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.830] class
[00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.130] two
[00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.570] state
[00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:46.830] here,
[00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:47.330] we
[00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:47.510] know
[00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.710] that
[00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.910] no
[00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:48.050] matter
[00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:48.290] what
[00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:48.430] we
[00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.750] do
[00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.570] afterwards,
[00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:49.930] we're
[00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:50.010] going
[00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:50.050] to
[00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:50.250] get
[00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:50.430] a
[00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.670] reward
[00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:50.790] of
[00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:51.010] minus
[00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:51.350] two
[00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.110] at
[00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:52.290] this
[00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:52.490] time
[00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.810] step.
[00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.710] It
[00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.930] doesn't
[00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:54.170] matter
[00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:54.310] that
[00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.470] we're
[00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.490] going
[00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:54.530] to
[00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:54.650] get
[00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:54.790] these
[00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:54.950] other
[00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:55.230] things
[00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.330] and
[00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:55.450] this
[00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:55.630] plus
[00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.870] 10
[00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:56.170] later.
[00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.470] That's
[00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.790] irrelevant
[00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.130] because
[00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:57.290] we're
[00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:57.430] just
[00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.630] looking
[00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.750] at
[00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.850] how
[00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:58.030] much
[00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:58.250] reward
[00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:58.390] we
[00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:58.530] get
[00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:58.870] at
[00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:59.030] this
[00:27:59.030 --> 00:27:59.230] time
[00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.430] step
[00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.710] onwards.
[00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:00.370] So
[00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:00.490] the
[00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:00.750] value
[00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:00.910] of
[00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:01.070] being
[00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.210] in
[00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:01.350] this
[00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.550] state
[00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:01.710] is
[00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:01.950] minus
[00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.230] two.
[00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:03.930] That's
[00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:04.030] what
[00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:04.170] we're
[00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:04.230] going
[00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.310] to
[00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.470] get.
[00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:04.650] We're
[00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:04.670] going
[00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:04.670] to
[00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:04.770] get
[00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:04.990] minus
[00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.190] two
[00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.370] whether
[00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:05.490] we
[00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:05.610] go
[00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:05.750] to
[00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.010] sleep
[00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:06.150] or
[00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:06.310] whether
[00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.430] we
[00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.530] go
[00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:06.690] this
[00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:06.830] way,
[00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.970] we're
[00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:07.010] going
[00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.030] to
[00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:07.130] get
[00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.350] minus
[00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.570] two.
[00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:08.470] That's
[00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.610] just
[00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:08.730] the
[00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:09.070] definition
[00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.210] of
[00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:09.350] that.
[00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:11.030] However,
[00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:11.390] if
[00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.490] we
[00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:11.670] look
[00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:11.890] at
[00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:12.230] a
[00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.370] more
[00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:12.670] long
[00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:13.050]-sighted
[00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:13.330] discount
[00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:13.670] factor,
[00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:13.850] so
[00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:14.010] this
[00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:14.150] is
[00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:14.350] like
[00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.630] 0
[00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.970].9
[00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:15.290] now,
[00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:17.050] then
[00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:17.430] the
[00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.690] values
[00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.870] all
[00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:18.390] change.
[00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:19.050] And
[00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:19.270] now
[00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:19.410] we
[00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:19.530] have
[00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:19.650] to
[00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:19.990] consider,
[00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.310] well,
[00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.410] if
[00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:20.510] I
[00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:20.590] was
[00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.690] in
[00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.870] this
[00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:21.150] state,
[00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:21.970] I'm
[00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:21.990] going
[00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.010] to
[00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.110] get
[00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:22.190] a
[00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.410] reward
[00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:22.550] of
[00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:22.770] minus
[00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:23.070] two
[00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.330] now.
[00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:23.910] But
[00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:24.230] then
[00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:25.030] with
[00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:25.230] 0
[00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.410].8
[00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:25.790] probability,
[00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:26.010] I'm
[00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:26.070] going
[00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.150] to
[00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:26.510] transition
[00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.730] over
[00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:27.090] here
[00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:27.650] into
[00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:27.810] a
[00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:28.130] situation
[00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.350] where
[00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.510] I'm
[00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:28.590] going
[00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.650] to
[00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:28.970] get
[00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:29.550] additional
[00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:30.070] rewards,
[00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:30.610] minus
[00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:30.950] two,
[00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:31.110] and
[00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.290] then
[00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:31.610] probably
[00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.190] plus
[00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:32.390] 10
[00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:32.710] again,
[00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:32.870] and
[00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:33.010] so
[00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:33.270] forth.
[00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.510] When
[00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:34.670] we
[00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:34.850] factor
[00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:35.030] that
[00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:35.190] all
[00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.530] together
[00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:35.750] on
[00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:36.090] a
[00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:36.150] computer,
[00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.390] and
[00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:36.510] we'll
[00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:36.670] see
[00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:36.830] how
[00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.950] to
[00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:37.170] compute
[00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:37.370] these
[00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.550] things
[00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:37.810] later
[00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:37.970] as
[00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:38.110] we
[00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.290] go
[00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:38.510] on,
[00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:40.010] the
[00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.210] value
[00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:40.330] of
[00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:40.430] this
[00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.610] state
[00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.890] actually
[00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:41.350] becomes
[00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.070] much
[00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.350] better.
[00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.530] We
[00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:42.670] can
[00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:42.810] get
[00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:43.030] 0
[00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.290].9
[00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:43.590] reward
[00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.750] from
[00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.910] this
[00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:44.130] state
[00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:44.430] onwards,
[00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:45.330] kind
[00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:45.450] of
[00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:45.870] averaging
[00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:46.170] over
[00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:46.530] the
[00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:46.990] probability
[00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.130] of
[00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.310] falling
[00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.590] asleep
[00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.050] and
[00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:48.750] continuing
[00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.990] through
[00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.130] the
[00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.430] classes.
[00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.150] So
[00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:51.350] that's
[00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.450] the
[00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:51.670] value.
[00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:51.890] That's
[00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.010] the
[00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.470] average.
[00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:52.690] Now,
[00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:52.830] the
[00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.370] expectation
[00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:53.670] over
[00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:53.910] all
[00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:54.010] of
[00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:54.090] the
[00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:54.290] different
[00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:54.630] paths
[00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.790] that
[00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:54.890] we
[00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:55.030] can
[00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:55.270] take
[00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:55.430] through
[00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.650] this
[00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.050] system,
[00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.670] I'm
[00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:56.870] taking
[00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:57.150] average
[00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:57.330] of
[00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:57.470] them.
[00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:58.050] That's
[00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:58.150] the
[00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:58.350] number
[00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.570] that
[00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:58.790] kind
[00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:58.870] of
[00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:59.350] summarizes
[00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.570] how
[00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.750] good
[00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.850] it
[00:28:59.850 --> 00:28:59.970] is
[00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:00.050] to
[00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:00.150] be
[00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:00.250] in
[00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:00.390] that
[00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:00.630] state.
[00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.830] We're
[00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.850] going
[00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:00.870] to
[00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.990] get
[00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.210] 0
[00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:01.470].9
[00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:01.730] units
[00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:01.870] of
[00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:02.110] reward
[00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.290] from
[00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:02.450] then
[00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:02.790] onwards
[00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:03.410] if
[00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:03.510] we
[00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.770] start
[00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:03.970] there.
[00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.110] If
[00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.170] I
[00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:04.370] drop
[00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.470] you
[00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.630] into
[00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.790] that
[00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:05.130] class,
[00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.830] 0
[00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:06.110].9,
[00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:06.350] that's
[00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.450] how
[00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:06.590] good
[00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.710] you
[00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.850] are.
[00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:08.150] OK.
[00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:11.810] So
[00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:12.350] now
[00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.530] we're
[00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:12.530] going
[00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:12.570] to
[00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:12.750] talk
[00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.070] about,
[00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.490] this
[00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:13.630] is
[00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.250] maybe
[00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:14.390] the
[00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:14.590] most
[00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.070] fundamental
[00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.690] relationship
[00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:16.070] in
[00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.710] reinforcement
[00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:17.070] learning.
[00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:17.950] You
[00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:18.070] might
[00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.170] have
[00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:18.290] come
[00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:18.490] across
[00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:18.710] this
[00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.870] in
[00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:19.310] dynamic
[00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.750] programming.
[00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:20.050] It's
[00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:20.450] very
[00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.810] widely
[00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.290] used.
[00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:22.870] And
[00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.950] it's
[00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:23.070] called
[00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.210] the
[00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:23.430] Bellman
[00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.790] equation.
[00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:24.810] And
[00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:24.910] the
[00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:25.130] idea
[00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.290] is
[00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:25.430] that
[00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.730] the
[00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:26.110] value
[00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.450] function
[00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.650] sort
[00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:26.750] of
[00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:27.110] obeys
[00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.370] this
[00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:28.150] recursive
[00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:28.650] decomposition.
[00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.210] And
[00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:30.310] the
[00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.450] main
[00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:30.670] idea
[00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:30.810] is
[00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:30.950] very
[00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:31.230] simple.
[00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.450] It
[00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:31.930] basically
[00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:32.190] says
[00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.330] that
[00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.430] you
[00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.530] can
[00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:32.850] take
[00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.210] your
[00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:33.950] sequence
[00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:34.350] of
[00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.970] rewards
[00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:35.310] from
[00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.810] this
[00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:36.050] time
[00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:36.410] step
[00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:36.970] all
[00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:37.090] the
[00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:37.210] way
[00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:37.450] onwards
[00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:37.710] and
[00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.790] you
[00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:37.910] can
[00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:38.130] break
[00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:38.230] it
[00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.350] up
[00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:38.490] into
[00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:38.710] two
[00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:39.130] parts,
[00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:39.630] which
[00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.910] basically
[00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:40.310] consists
[00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.490] of
[00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.630] the
[00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:41.070] immediate
[00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.430] reward
[00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.570] that
[00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:41.670] you're
[00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:41.810] going
[00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.930] to
[00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:42.250] get
[00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.390] and
[00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:43.530] then
[00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:43.650] the
[00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:43.890] value
[00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:44.030] that
[00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:44.150] you'll
[00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:44.290] get
[00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:44.450] from
[00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.610] that
[00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:44.810] time
[00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:45.010] step
[00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:45.330] onwards.
[00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:46.350] So
[00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.430] you
[00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.610] break
[00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.690] it
[00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:46.790] up
[00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:46.950] into
[00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:47.230] immediate
[00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.610] reward.
[00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:48.090] And
[00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:48.210] then
[00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:48.390] from
[00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:48.530] the
[00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:48.850] successor
[00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:49.110] state
[00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.230] that
[00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.270] you
[00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:49.410] end
[00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:49.590] up
[00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.770] in,
[00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:50.650] the
[00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:50.990] value
[00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.430] of
[00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.650] where
[00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:51.750] you
[00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.910] end
[00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:52.150] up.
[00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:52.510] So
[00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:52.810] immediate
[00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:53.130] reward
[00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:53.310] plus
[00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.450] the
[00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.630] value
[00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.750] of
[00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.870] where
[00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:54.130] you
[00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:54.290] end
[00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:54.530] up.
[00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.110] Now,
[00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:55.210] if
[00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:55.350] I'm
[00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.470] a
[00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.710] robot,
[00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.430] I
[00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.590] might
[00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.730] get
[00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:57.050] an
[00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:57.350] immediate
[00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.710] reward
[00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.870] of
[00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:58.030] like
[00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:58.270] plus
[00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:58.530] 10.
[00:29:59.610 --> 00:29:59.930] But
[00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:00.090] then
[00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:00.210] I
[00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:00.330] end
[00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:00.470] up
[00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.550] in
[00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:00.690] this
[00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:00.850] new
[00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:01.110] state.
[00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:01.230] And
[00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.310] the
[00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.490] question
[00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.650] is,
[00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:01.770] how
[00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:01.930] good
[00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:02.030] is
[00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:02.130] it
[00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:02.210] to
[00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.290] be
[00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:02.390] in
[00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:02.510] this
[00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.690] new
[00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.950] state?
[00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:03.530] And
[00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:03.650] so
[00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:03.770] the
[00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:04.030] overall
[00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:04.310] value
[00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.630] function
[00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.790] of
[00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:04.950] being
[00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:05.290] here
[00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:05.890] is
[00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:06.070] like
[00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.390] my
[00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:06.610] 10
[00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:06.910] points
[00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:07.030] of
[00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:07.270] immediate
[00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:07.550] reward
[00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:07.750] plus
[00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.910] the
[00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:08.110] value
[00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.210] of
[00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.330] where
[00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.430] I
[00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.590] ended
[00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.830] up.
[00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:09.230] And
[00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.330] that's
[00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:09.450] what
[00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:09.550] the
[00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:09.710] Bellman
[00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:10.010] equation
[00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.350] tells
[00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.530] me.
[00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:11.670] So
[00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:12.050] formally,
[00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.270] if
[00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:12.350] we
[00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.530] just
[00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:12.790] step
[00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:12.990] through
[00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.190] this,
[00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:13.290] it's
[00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:13.470] very
[00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.870] straightforward.
[00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:14.590] So
[00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.730] this
[00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:14.810] is
[00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.930] our
[00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:15.170] value
[00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:15.530] function.
[00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:15.790] The
[00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:16.010] value
[00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.290] function
[00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:16.450] is
[00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:16.590] the
[00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.010] expected
[00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:17.510] return
[00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.590] given
[00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.750] that
[00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.850] I
[00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:19.110] start
[00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.190] in
[00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.270] a
[00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:19.510] particular
[00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.930] state.
[00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.450] So
[00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.590] that's
[00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.730] how
[00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:20.970] we
[00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:21.090] want
[00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:21.150] to
[00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:21.250] know
[00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:21.350] how
[00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.530] good
[00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:21.630] is
[00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:21.710] it
[00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.810] to
[00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:21.930] be
[00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:22.010] in
[00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.170] this
[00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:22.390] state.
[00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.490] And
[00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.630] it's
[00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.710] the
[00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.010] expected
[00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:23.350] return
[00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.510] if
[00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.590] you
[00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.810] start
[00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.930] in
[00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:24.050] that
[00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:24.330] state.
[00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:25.250] If
[00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.290] we
[00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:25.550] just
[00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:26.310] unwrap
[00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.450] the
[00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.770] definition
[00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:26.950] of
[00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:27.290] return,
[00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:27.810] the
[00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:28.090] return
[00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:28.250] is
[00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.450] just
[00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:28.810] the
[00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:29.330] sum
[00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.450] of
[00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.610] these
[00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:29.930] rewards
[00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:30.150] going
[00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:30.290] into
[00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:30.390] the
[00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:30.690] future,
[00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:31.390] discounted.
[00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.430] We
[00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.570] can
[00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.810] break
[00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:33.050] down
[00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:33.270] those
[00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:33.430] sum
[00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.550] of
[00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:34.370] rewards
[00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.630] into
[00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.810] the
[00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.110] immediate
[00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.570] reward
[00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.430] plus
[00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:37.310] the
[00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.830] discounted
[00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.110] value,
[00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.690] the
[00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:39.370] discounted
[00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.110] return
[00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.370] from
[00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.530] the
[00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:40.690] next
[00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:40.970] step.
[00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.150] So
[00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:41.770] we
[00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.070] just
[00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.290] pull
[00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:42.410] out
[00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:42.550] the
[00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:42.790] discount
[00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:43.110] factor.
[00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.310] We've
[00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.550] got
[00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:44.530] starting
[00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:44.750] from
[00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.010] rt
[00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:45.210] plus
[00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:45.450] 2
[00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:45.710] plus
[00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.930] gamma
[00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:46.250] rt
[00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.450] plus
[00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:46.670] 3
[00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:46.850] and
[00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:47.030] so
[00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:47.170] on
[00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:47.230] and
[00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.330] so
[00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.630] forth.
[00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:48.150] OK,
[00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:48.410] just
[00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:48.630] pull
[00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.770] the
[00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:48.970] factor
[00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:49.090] of
[00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:49.250] gamma
[00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.530] out.
[00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:50.170] And
[00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:50.330] now
[00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.450] we
[00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.590] see
[00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.730] that
[00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:50.890] this
[00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:51.070] thing
[00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.370] here
[00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:51.910] is
[00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:52.070] just
[00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.190] the
[00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.470] return
[00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.690] from
[00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:52.810] the
[00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:52.990] next
[00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.190] time
[00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.490] step.
[00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:54.990] Return
[00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.390] starting
[00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:55.590] from
[00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.770] t
[00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:55.950] plus
[00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:56.270] 2
[00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:56.650] instead
[00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:56.750] of
[00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.890] from
[00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:57.010] t
[00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:57.210] plus
[00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:57.470] 1.
[00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.810] So
[00:30:58.810 --> 00:30:59.030] that's
[00:30:59.030 --> 00:30:59.170] this
[00:30:59.170 --> 00:30:59.350] thing
[00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.570] here.
[00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.010] It's
[00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:00.130] the
[00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:00.510] expected
[00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:01.210] immediate

[00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:02.710] return.
[00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:03.730] And
[00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:03.990] then
[00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.310] by
[00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.430] the

[00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:04.690] of
[00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:05.070] iterated
[00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.650] expectations,
[00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:06.270] what
[00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:06.390] we
[00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:06.470] can
[00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.650] do
[00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:06.750] is
[00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.030] basically
[00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:07.270] say
[00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:07.450] the
[00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:08.050] expectation
[00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.010] of
[00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:09.170] this
[00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:09.690] return
[00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:10.110] is
[00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.230] the
[00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.470] same
[00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.590] as
[00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.730] the
[00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:11.350] expectation
[00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.830] of
[00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.930] the
[00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:12.450] expectation
[00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:12.650] of
[00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:12.770] this
[00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:13.110] return.
[00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:13.330] That's
[00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:13.450] called
[00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:13.590] the
[00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.710] law
[00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.830] of
[00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:14.150] iterated
[00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:14.730] expectations,
[00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:15.870] which
[00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:16.050] gives
[00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:16.170] us
[00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:16.310] this
[00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.590] final
[00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.870] line
[00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:17.170] here,
[00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.610] which
[00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:17.830] tells
[00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.970] us
[00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:18.070] that
[00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.170] the
[00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:18.430] value
[00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.870] function
[00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:19.050] in
[00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:19.250] state
[00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.590] s
[00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.270] is
[00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:20.490] equal
[00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:20.650] to
[00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:20.790] the
[00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.550] expected
[00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:22.210] immediate
[00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:22.690] reward
[00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:23.170] plus
[00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:23.310] the
[00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.550] value
[00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:23.850] function
[00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:23.970] of
[00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:24.070] the
[00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.250] next
[00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:24.530] state.
[00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:26.150] Yeah,
[00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:26.530] question?
[00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:26.890] I'm
[00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:27.190] slightly
[00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.630] confused
[00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:27.830] with
[00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.030] the
[00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:28.590] indexes
[00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.850] here.
[00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.690] Like,
[00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:30.490] when
[00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:30.630] we
[00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.910] start
[00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:31.130] with
[00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.630] state
[00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.110] st,
[00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:33.750] but
[00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:34.030] the
[00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:34.250] time
[00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.430] is
[00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.670] t,
[00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:35.350] and
[00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.670] we
[00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:36.590] count
[00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.810] the
[00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:37.130] reward,
[00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:37.910] the
[00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:38.150] first
[00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:38.490] reward,
[00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:39.110] like
[00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.750] t
[00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:40.010] plus
[00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.310] 1.
[00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:40.810] OK,
[00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.150] so
[00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:41.250] the
[00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:41.450] question
[00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.610] is,
[00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.790] why
[00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:41.890] do
[00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:42.150] we
[00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:42.650] index
[00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:42.870] the
[00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:43.270] reward
[00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:43.410] at
[00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:43.610] time
[00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.750] t
[00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.970] plus
[00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:44.290] 1?
[00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:45.810] Actually,
[00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:45.950] you'll
[00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:46.170] find
[00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:46.450] both
[00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:46.570] in
[00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:46.670] the
[00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:46.970] literature.
[00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.610] So
[00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:47.790] we're
[00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.010] following
[00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:48.330] the
[00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:48.850] Satyavarta
[00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:49.290] Convention,
[00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:49.610] which
[00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:50.170] indexes
[00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:50.530] rewards
[00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:50.690] at
[00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.850] time
[00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:51.030] step
[00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:51.190] t
[00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.410] plus
[00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:51.610] 1
[00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:51.810] rather
[00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:51.950] than
[00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:52.130] time
[00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:52.330] step
[00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:52.670] t.
[00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:53.930] This
[00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:54.190] comes
[00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.570] from
[00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:54.970] how
[00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:55.110] we
[00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.270] think
[00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:55.390] of
[00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:55.490] the
[00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.770] boundary
[00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:56.050] between
[00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:56.390] agent
[00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:56.570] and
[00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.990] environment,
[00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.290] that
[00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:57.390] the
[00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:57.590] idea
[00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.770] is
[00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:57.910] that
[00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:58.110] the
[00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.730] action
[00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:59.170] that
[00:31:59.170 --> 00:31:59.310] we
[00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.550] take
[00:31:59.550 --> 00:31:59.810] goes
[00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:00.030] into
[00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:00.170] the
[00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:00.530] environment,
[00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:01.150] then
[00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:01.490] a
[00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.690] time
[00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:01.890] step
[00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:02.430] happens
[00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:03.430] whilst,
[00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:03.870] you
[00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.990] know,
[00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.430] that
[00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:05.010] we
[00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:05.370] switch
[00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:05.550] our
[00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:05.770] time
[00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.170] index
[00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:07.030] after
[00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:07.410] control
[00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:07.770] passes
[00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:08.150] back
[00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:08.590] from
[00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.710] the
[00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:09.010] environment
[00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:09.190] to
[00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.290] the
[00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:09.490] agent.
[00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.730] We're
[00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:09.810] in
[00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:09.910] a
[00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:10.030] new
[00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:10.250] time
[00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.530] step.
[00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:11.330] So
[00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:11.450] at
[00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:11.590] that
[00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.810] point,
[00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:12.090] everything
[00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:12.270] we
[00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:12.530] receive
[00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:12.770] from
[00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:12.970] the
[00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:13.710] environment
[00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:14.090] has
[00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.390] a
[00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:14.590] new
[00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.070] time
[00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.410] index.
[00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:15.650] So
[00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:16.130] everything
[00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.410] after
[00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:16.530] the
[00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:16.790] environment
[00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:16.950] is
[00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:17.070] a
[00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.210] time
[00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.350] step
[00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.510] t
[00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.710] plus
[00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.910] 1.
[00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:18.670] You
[00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:18.850] might
[00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:18.990] even
[00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.230] find
[00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.350] that
[00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.490] my
[00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.790] slides
[00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:19.990] might
[00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.110] be
[00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.350] slightly
[00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.710] inconsistent
[00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:21.050] on
[00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:21.170] this
[00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:21.370] point.
[00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:21.570] So
[00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:21.710] it's
[00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.870] a
[00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:22.190] good
[00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.470] spot.
[00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.710] So
[00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.950] I'm
[00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:23.110] sorry
[00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.230] if
[00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.390] that's
[00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:23.470] the
[00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.690] case.
[00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.310] Yeah.
[00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:24.370] Yeah,
[00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:24.810] actually,
[00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:25.330] if
[00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:25.490] you
[00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.870] define
[00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:26.030] it
[00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:26.330] that
[00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.590] way,
[00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.830] when
[00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:27.190] gamma
[00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.430] is
[00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.730] equal
[00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:28.030] to
[00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:28.350] 0,
[00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:29.370] the
[00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:29.750] actual
[00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.070] value
[00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.270] of
[00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:30.450] the
[00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:30.870] state
[00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:32.110] won't
[00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.250] be
[00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:32.490] there
[00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:33.130] immediately.
[00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:33.570] All
[00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:33.710] you
[00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.870] go
[00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:34.010] to
[00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.250] is
[00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.710] the
[00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:35.170] probability
[00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:35.510] of
[00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.690] the
[00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:36.210] slide.
[00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:36.470] If
[00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.570] you
[00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:36.730] go
[00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:36.870] to
[00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:37.030] the
[00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:37.390] slide
[00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:37.810] where
[00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:38.070] gamma
[00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.270] is
[00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:38.470] equal
[00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.590] to
[00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.890] 0
[00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:39.250] here,
[00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:40.510] the
[00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:40.830] actual
[00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.170] values
[00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:41.350] of
[00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.470] the
[00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.750] state
[00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.950] are
[00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:42.130] going
[00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:42.230] to
[00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.370] be
[00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:42.750] different.
[00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.990] So
[00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.250] there,
[00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.530] I
[00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:43.730] think...
[00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.550] No,
[00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.730] that's
[00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:44.850] not
[00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:44.970] true.
[00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.090] It's
[00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:45.230] just
[00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.330] a
[00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:45.590] difference.
[00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.530] It's
[00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:46.790] literally
[00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.090] just
[00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.450] re
[00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.950]-indexing.
[00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:48.290] So
[00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:48.390] you
[00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:48.510] can
[00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:48.670] re
[00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:48.950]-index
[00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:49.350] everything
[00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.590] with
[00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.950] rt
[00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:50.190] instead
[00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.310] of
[00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.510] rt
[00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.710] plus
[00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.850] 1.
[00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:50.950] It's
[00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:51.030] not
[00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:51.190] going
[00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.210] to
[00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:51.390] change
[00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:51.550] any
[00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:51.650] of
[00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:51.710] the
[00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.870] math
[00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:52.050] and
[00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:52.330] any
[00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:52.410] of
[00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:52.490] the
[00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.850] semantics.
[00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:53.110] It's
[00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.210] all
[00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.330] the
[00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.510] same.
[00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.790] In
[00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:54.930] the
[00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:55.210] previous
[00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:55.590] slide,
[00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:55.710] the
[00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:56.090] reward
[00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.770] with
[00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:57.310] zero
[00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.970] discounting
[00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:58.130] was
[00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.410] the
[00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:58.710] reward
[00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.870] in
[00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:59.010] the
[00:32:59.010 --> 00:32:59.230] state
[00:32:59.230 --> 00:32:59.390] that
[00:32:59.390 --> 00:32:59.550] I'm
[00:32:59.550 --> 00:32:59.910] currently
[00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:00.210] in.
[00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:00.790] If
[00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:00.930] you
[00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:01.110] set
[00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.510] gamma
[00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:01.910] to
[00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:02.210] 0
[00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.450] here,
[00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.570] it
[00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:02.750] looks
[00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.950] like
[00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:03.090] the
[00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:03.470] reward
[00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.610] of
[00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:04.010] the
[00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.210] state
[00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:04.310] I'm
[00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.610] currently
[00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.790] in
[00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:04.930] is
[00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:05.070] the
[00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.490] expected
[00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:05.950] reward
[00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:06.110] of
[00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.230] the
[00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.470] next
[00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.930] state.
[00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.410] It
[00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:07.590] just
[00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.370] depends
[00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.510] on
[00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:10.670] how
[00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:10.830] we
[00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:11.390] define
[00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:12.030] rt.
[00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.390] Like,
[00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.570] where
[00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:12.730] does
[00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:12.930] that
[00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:13.130] time
[00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.330] step
[00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:13.550] t
[00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:13.830] refer
[00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:14.130] to?
[00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:14.890] So
[00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:15.150] here,
[00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:15.350] what
[00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.470] we're
[00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.730] saying
[00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:15.870] is
[00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:16.030] this
[00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:16.170] is
[00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:16.870] actually...
[00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.890] If
[00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:17.530] we
[00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:17.810] move
[00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.970] into
[00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:18.150] this
[00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:18.330] state
[00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:18.450] at
[00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:18.630] time
[00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.810] step
[00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:19.090] t,
[00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:19.590] then
[00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.990] this
[00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.610] figure
[00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:20.850] now
[00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:21.350] indicates
[00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.490] that
[00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:21.630] this
[00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:21.970] reward
[00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:22.110] is
[00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.230] what
[00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.470] happens
[00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.590] at
[00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.750] time
[00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.910] step
[00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.070] t
[00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.270] plus
[00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:23.490] 1.
[00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:24.490] That's
[00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:24.670] all.
[00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:24.990] But
[00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.130] we
[00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.690] move
[00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:25.850] into
[00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:26.050] this
[00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:26.250] state,
[00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.410] and
[00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:26.550] then
[00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:26.670] we
[00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:26.810] get
[00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.970] this
[00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:27.210] reward
[00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:27.390] no
[00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:27.510] matter
[00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:27.670] what
[00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:27.790] we
[00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:27.850] do.
[00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:27.910] So
[00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:27.910] the
[00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:28.570] indexing
[00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:28.790] of
[00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:29.210] the
[00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.450] r
[00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:29.710] of
[00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.890] the
[00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:30.270] reward
[00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:30.530] and
[00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:30.730] the
[00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:31.110] state
[00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.490] is...
[00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:33.890] So
[00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:34.250] it's
[00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:35.030] just
[00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.190] a
[00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.550] convention.
[00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:35.890] It's
[00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:36.030] just
[00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.190] a
[00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.410] convention,
[00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:36.610] so
[00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:36.830] don't
[00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:37.110] confuse
[00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.370] yourselves.
[00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.570] It's
[00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:37.710] just
[00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.850] a
[00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:38.150] convention.
[00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:39.610] Stick
[00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:39.770] to
[00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:39.870] the
[00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:40.110] very
[00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.610] intuitive
[00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.030] idea
[00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:41.150] that
[00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:41.230] you
[00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.370] move
[00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:41.510] into
[00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:41.650] a
[00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:41.810] state,
[00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:41.950] you
[00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:42.090] get
[00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:42.250] some
[00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:42.590] reward,
[00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:43.130] everything
[00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.330] is
[00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:43.510] good.
[00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.750] So
[00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.150] let's
[00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:51.310] just
[00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.450] try
[00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:51.550] and
[00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:51.830] understand
[00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.030] this
[00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:52.250] Bellman
[00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.530] equation
[00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:52.710] a
[00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.830] little
[00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.010] bit
[00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:53.210] more.
[00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:53.930] So
[00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:54.150] the
[00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:54.370] Bellman
[00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:54.570] equation...
[00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:55.910] So
[00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:56.050] this
[00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:56.150] is
[00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:56.290] our
[00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:56.510] Bellman
[00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:56.830] equation.
[00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:57.010] The
[00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:57.210] value
[00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:57.490] function
[00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:57.810] now
[00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:58.230] is
[00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.610] equal
[00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.730] to
[00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.870] the
[00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:59.310] expected
[00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.790] immediate
[00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:00.210] reward
[00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:00.450] plus
[00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:00.950] discounted
[00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.150] value
[00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:01.250] at
[00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:01.330] the
[00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:01.510] next
[00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:01.770] state.
[00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.610] So
[00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:02.930] value
[00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.230] now,
[00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:03.750] take
[00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.910] a
[00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:04.170] step,
[00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:05.250] see
[00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:05.390] what
[00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:05.490] the
[00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:05.670] value
[00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:05.830] is
[00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.910] in
[00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:06.030] the
[00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:06.210] state
[00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:06.350] I
[00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.490] end
[00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:06.650] up.
[00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:08.110] And
[00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:08.450] that's
[00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:08.850] just
[00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:09.050] like
[00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.670] a
[00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:10.270] tautological
[00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.810] definition.
[00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.090] If
[00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:11.230] we've
[00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.350] got
[00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:11.490] our
[00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:11.710] value
[00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:12.010] function
[00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:12.450] correct,
[00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.990] it
[00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.350] must
[00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:13.830] obey
[00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.070] this
[00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.510] identity.
[00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:15.750] That's
[00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.850] what
[00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:15.950] it
[00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:16.130] means
[00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:16.270] to
[00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.350] have
[00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:16.450] a
[00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:16.610] value
[00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:16.910] function.
[00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.890] If
[00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:18.010] we
[00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:18.210] don't
[00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:18.430] obey
[00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.610] this
[00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:18.930] identity,
[00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.110] we
[00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:19.330] haven't
[00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:19.550] found
[00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.670] the
[00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:19.850] value
[00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:20.130] function
[00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:20.370] yet.
[00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.370] So
[00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:21.510] one
[00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.650] way
[00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:21.750] to
[00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:22.090] understand
[00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:22.290] this
[00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:22.410] is
[00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:22.530] by
[00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:22.770] using
[00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:22.930] what
[00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:23.070] we
[00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:23.250] call
[00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:23.450] these
[00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:24.070] backup
[00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:24.630] diagrams
[00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:24.950] here.
[00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:25.770] So
[00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:25.910] these
[00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:26.210] backup
[00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.750] diagrams,
[00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.770] this
[00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.850] is
[00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:28.190] basically
[00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.570] showing
[00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:28.790] us...
[00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:29.850] You
[00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:29.970] can
[00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:30.130] think
[00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:30.230] of
[00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.350] this
[00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:30.450] as
[00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:30.610] like
[00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:30.690] a
[00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:30.910] one
[00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:31.110]-step
[00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:31.370] look
[00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:31.490]-ahead
[00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.950] search.
[00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:32.490] So
[00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:32.570] we
[00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:32.850] start
[00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:32.990] in
[00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.130] this
[00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:33.350] state
[00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:33.710] S,
[00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:34.330] and
[00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:34.430] we
[00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.570] can
[00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:34.710] look
[00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.990] ahead
[00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.590] one
[00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.370] step
[00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:36.530] if
[00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.630] you
[00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:36.870] like.
[00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:37.270] So
[00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.630] this
[00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:37.890] state
[00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:38.150] S
[00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:38.430] leads
[00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.590] to
[00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:38.710] a
[00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.890] value
[00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:39.190] function
[00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.410] of
[00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:39.730] V
[00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:39.890] of
[00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:40.110] S.
[00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:40.930] If
[00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:41.010] we
[00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:41.130] go
[00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:41.330] down
[00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:41.450] to
[00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:41.650] S
[00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:41.910] prime
[00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:42.290] here
[00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.470] or
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.750] here,
[00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:43.310] we're
[00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.370] going
[00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:43.410] to
[00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:43.670] have
[00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:44.290] a
[00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:44.490] value
[00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:44.790] function
[00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:45.030] that's
[00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.270] V
[00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.410] of
[00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:45.650] the
[00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:46.090] successor
[00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:46.430] state.
[00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:47.850] And
[00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:48.050] we're
[00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.050] going
[00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.050] to
[00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.170] get
[00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:48.370] some
[00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:48.610] immediate
[00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:48.930] reward
[00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:49.110] along
[00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:49.230] the
[00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.410] way.
[00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.830] So
[00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:49.970] this
[00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:50.290] diagram
[00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:50.430] is
[00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.570] just
[00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.730] kind
[00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:50.810] of
[00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:51.050] showing
[00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.230] us
[00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.330] that
[00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:51.430] we
[00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.550] can
[00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.770] think
[00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:51.870] of
[00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:52.010] this
[00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.130] as
[00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:52.210] a
[00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:52.430] one
[00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.630]-step
[00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:52.890] look
[00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:53.010]-ahead
[00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:53.350] tree
[00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:54.210] where
[00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:54.390] you
[00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:54.630] start
[00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:54.730] in
[00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:54.870] this
[00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:55.090] state,
[00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:55.230] you
[00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.390] look
[00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:55.590] ahead
[00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:55.830] one
[00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.130] step,
[00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.650] you
[00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:57.010] integrate
[00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:57.310] over
[00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.470] the
[00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.810] probability
[00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:58.170] of
[00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:58.510] each
[00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.630] of
[00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.810] these...
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.320] Okay,
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:40.360] so
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:40.460] it's
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:40.540] a
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:40.760] one
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:40.940]-step
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:41.180] look

[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:41.940] with
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.060] like
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:42.240] this
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:42.780] averaging,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.280] where

[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:43.520] kind
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:43.600] of
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:43.760] go
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:43.960] ahead
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.140] one
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:44.340] step,
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:44.520] we
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:44.820] average
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.080] all
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:45.200] the
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:45.440] possible
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:45.740] outcomes
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:46.100] together,
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:46.360] and
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:46.500] that
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:46.640] gives
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:46.760] us
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:46.880] the
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.080] value
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:47.340] function
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:47.460] at
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:47.600] this
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:47.820] step.
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:48.780] And
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:48.980] that's
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.200] actually
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:49.720] kind
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:49.820] of
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:49.980] the
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:50.140] way
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:50.260] that
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:50.380] we're
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:50.480] going
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:50.640] to
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:50.980] proceed
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.160] when
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:51.260] we
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:51.420] actually
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:51.640] start
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:51.760] to
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:51.880] build
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.460] algorithms.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.020] They're
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:53.060] going
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:53.140] to
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:53.320] do
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:53.540] something
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:53.740] like
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:53.900] this
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:54.080] look
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:54.200]-ahead
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:54.600] process,
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:54.860] which
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:54.980] is
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.120] why
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:55.280] it's
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:55.500] useful
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:55.680] to
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:55.840] have
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:55.980] these
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.260] backup
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:56.700] diagrams
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:56.880] in
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.080] mind.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.320] Okay,
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:35:59.760] so
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:35:59.840] if
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:35:59.900] we
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:00.080] think
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:00.260] about
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:00.400] the
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:00.560] value
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:00.860] function
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:01.020] now,
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:01.180] let's
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:01.320] just
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:01.500] pick
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:01.660] out
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:01.880] one
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.260] state.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:03.420] So
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:03.520] if
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:03.580] we
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:03.780] pick
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:03.920] out
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:04.120] this
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:04.420] state
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:04.800] here,
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:07.540] so
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:07.940] this
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:08.060] is
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:08.260] the
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:08.720] class
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.240] three
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.680] state.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:10.600] And
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:10.800] so
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.160] I'm
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:11.260] just
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:11.360] going
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:11.460] to
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:11.680] tell
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:11.900] you
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.360] that
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:12.760] this
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:12.880] is
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.040] going
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.340] back,
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:13.480] I
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:13.600] think
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:13.760] this
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:13.860] is
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.120] a
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:14.720] discount
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.200] factor
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:15.800] of
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.320] one
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:16.560] now,
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:16.840] so
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.000] it's
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:17.780] undiscounted.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:18.640] And
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:18.760] what
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:18.900] we're
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.100] looking
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:19.380] at
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:19.800] is
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:19.940] what
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:20.200] happens
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:20.320] if
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:20.420] we're
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:20.540] in
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:20.700] this
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:20.980] state
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:21.180] with
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:21.380] no
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.000] discounting.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.260] So
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:23.620] I
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:24.080] claimed
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:24.260] that
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:24.640] this
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:24.760] was
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:24.900] the
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.100] value
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.480] function
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.040] of
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.200] this
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:26.500] MDP,
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:26.860] but
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.080] how
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:27.200] can
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:27.300] we
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:27.580] verify
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:27.860] that?
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.020] Well,
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:28.120] we
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:28.220] can
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:28.340] use
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:28.420] the
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:28.600] Bellman
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:28.860] equation
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.080] to
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:29.340] verify
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:29.600] that.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:29.720] We
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:29.820] can
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:29.980] say,
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:30.240] okay,
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:30.840] well,
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:30.940] if
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:31.100] this
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:31.340] value
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:31.620] function
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:31.740] is
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:31.940] 4
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.340].3,
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:32.540] it
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:32.720] should
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:32.960] really
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.140] be
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:33.460] equal
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:33.640] to
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:33.900] doing
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.260] like
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:34.340] a
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:34.540] one
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:34.720]-step
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:34.960] look
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.240]-ahead,
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.300] averaging
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:36.580] over
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:36.720] all
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:36.820] the
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:36.960] things
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.080] which
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:37.240] might
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:37.500] happen
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:37.860] next,
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:38.300] and
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:38.560] then
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:38.920] ending
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:39.080] up
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:39.280] back
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:39.480] here
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:39.760] again.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:40.580] Okay,
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:40.880] so
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.060] let's
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:41.160] see
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.260] if
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:41.420] that's
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:41.600] really
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:41.920] true.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:42.580] Well,
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:42.800] from
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:42.980] here,
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:43.120] there
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:43.200] are
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:43.360] two
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:43.580] things
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:43.720] which
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:43.860] could
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:44.200] happen.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:45.980] So
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.340] we
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:46.460] could
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:46.860] either
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.720] basically
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.040] get...
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:51.580] So
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:51.760] we're
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:51.820] going
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:51.860] to
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:51.960] get
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.220] minus
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:52.640] two
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.700] immediate
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.040] reward
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.160] no
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:54.320] matter
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:54.540] what
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:55.000] happens.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:55.380] Okay,
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:55.560] that's
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:55.660] this
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:55.880] minus
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.100] two
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:56.380] here.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:57.480] And
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:57.620] then
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:57.780] with
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:57.940] 0
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.200].6
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.660] probability,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:36:59.320] you're
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:36:59.340] going
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:36:59.420] to
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:36:59.580] move
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:36:59.720] through
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:36:59.860] to
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:36:59.960] the
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.120] next
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:00.560] class
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.180] and
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:01.340] end
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:01.500] up
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:01.700] somewhere
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:01.840] with
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:01.940] a
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.120] value
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:02.260] of
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:02.500] 10.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:03.480] But
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:03.620] there's
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.020] also
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.740] 0
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.020].4
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.500] probability
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.160] that
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:06.340] you'll
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:06.480] go
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:06.580] to
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:06.720] the
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:06.980] pub
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:07.360] and
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:07.540] you'll
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:07.660] end
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:07.780] up
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:07.880] in
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.040] this
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:08.220] state,
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.380] which
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:08.520] had
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:08.600] a
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:08.780] value
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:08.920] of
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.080] 0
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:09.380].8.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.260] Okay,
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:10.720] so
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:10.800] if
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:10.880] we
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.040] sum
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.240] those
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:11.420] things
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:11.720] together,
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:11.880] we
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.020] get
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.300] minus
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:12.620] two
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:12.960] plus
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.200] 0
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:13.500].6
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:13.740] times
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.000] 10
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.220] plus
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:14.440] 0
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:14.640].4
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:14.980] times
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:15.380] 0
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:15.720].8,
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:16.960] which
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.360] to
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:17.900] numerical
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.280] precision
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:18.440] is
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:18.620] 4
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:19.020].3.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:20.600] Okay,
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.080] and
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:21.220] so
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:21.420] that
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:21.640] sort
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:21.780] of
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.380] validated
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:22.600] the
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:22.840] fact
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.000] that
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.160] this
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:23.380] really
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:23.540] is
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:23.680] the
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:23.940] value
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.040] of
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.180] this
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:24.480] MDP.
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:24.940] Yeah,
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:25.240] I'm
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:25.360] not
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:25.520] very
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:25.740] clear.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.040] What
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:26.180] is
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:26.480] this
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:26.900] capital
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:27.260] R?
[00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:31.370] This
[00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.710] is...
[00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.910] How
[00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:32.130] much
[00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.250] is
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:32.520] that?
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:32.960] Okay,
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:33.340] so
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.020] I
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.300] think
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:35.420] I
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:35.520] need
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:35.600] to
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:35.700] be
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:35.900] clear
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.080] about
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:36.220] the
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:36.520] rewards.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:36.740] I
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:36.920] think
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.100] a
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:37.220] few
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:37.440] people
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.880] are...
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.280] So
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:39.880] let
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.020] me
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.320] try
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:40.380] and
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:40.620] explain
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:40.740] that
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:40.860] more
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.080] quickly.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:41.720] What
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:41.940] this
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:42.260] diagram
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:42.700] represents
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.440] is
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:43.700] that
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.120] you're
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:44.260] in
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:44.460] some
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:44.840] state.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:46.600] When
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:46.800] you
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.140] exit
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:47.400] that
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:47.800] state,
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.480] regardless
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:48.720] of
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:48.840] what
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:48.960] you
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.220] do,
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:49.660] you
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:49.800] will
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.020] get
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:50.200] the
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:50.520] reward
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.000] indicated
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:51.280] by
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:51.460] this
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:51.720] R.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:52.920] Okay,
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:53.800] so
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.120] upon
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:54.500] exiting
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:54.740] that
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.060] state,
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:55.500] regardless
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:55.680] of
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:55.780] where
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:55.880] you
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.020] end
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:56.240] up,
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:56.620] you
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:56.720] will
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:56.880] get
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.180] this
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:57.400] minus
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:57.580] two.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:57.760] So
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:57.860] we
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:57.980] could
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.080] have
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.520] duplicated
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:58.780] this
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:37:58.900] and
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.040] written
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:37:59.280] R
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:37:59.520] minus
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:37:59.740] two
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:37:59.960] here,
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:00.220] R
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:00.420] minus
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:00.600] two
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:00.820] here,
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:00.940] and
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:01.000] it
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.100] could
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:01.180] have
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:01.300] been
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:01.420] on
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:01.600] these
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.060] arcs.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.080] And
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:03.360] actually,
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:03.540] when
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:03.720] you
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.240] define
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:04.600] Markov
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:04.960] reward
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.620] decision
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.040] processes,
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:06.300] which
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:06.380] we'll
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:06.540] see
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:06.900] later,
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:08.220] and
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:08.400] the
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:08.640] Markov
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:08.840] reward
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.120] process,
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:09.400] you
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:09.660] can
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:09.940] make
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.240] it
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.540] dependent
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:11.800] on
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:11.920] the
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.220] particular
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:12.560] arc
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:12.700] that
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:12.780] you
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:12.960] take.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:13.080] You
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:13.180] can
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:13.340] make
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:13.440] it
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:13.720] dependent
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:13.920] on
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.020] the
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:14.220] action.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:14.380] You
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:14.500] can
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:14.640] make
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:14.760] it
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:15.040] dependent
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:15.340] on
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:15.580] the
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.860] successor
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.120] state.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:17.360] All
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:17.460] of
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:17.580] these
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:17.740] things
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:17.860] are
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.160] possible.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:18.760] This
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:18.860] is
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.000] the
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.280] simplest
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:19.760] formulation.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.340] The
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:20.640] rewards
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:20.940] just
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.340] depend
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:21.680] on
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:21.860] the
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.040] state
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:22.180] that
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:22.380] you're
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:22.560] in,
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.080] and
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:23.260] that
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:23.580] state
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.280] determines
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:24.480] how
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:24.660] much
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:25.020] immediate
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.280] reward
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:25.500] you'll
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:25.740] get.
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:26.680] And
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:26.800] then
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:26.880] you
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:26.980] have
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:27.100] to
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:27.260] look
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:27.360] at
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:27.480] where
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:27.560] you
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:27.720] ended
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:27.960] up
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.080] to
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:28.220] see
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:28.360] how
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:28.580] much
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.060] immediate
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:29.340] reward
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:29.480] you'll
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:29.620] get
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:29.760] on
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:29.840] the
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.040] next
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:30.260] step.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.060] So
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:31.160] you
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:31.580] start
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:31.820] here,
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:31.960] you
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.160] exit
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.300] it,
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:32.380] you
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:32.500] get
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:32.740] minus
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:33.000] two.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:33.380] You
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:33.500] get
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:33.640] to
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:33.820] here,
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:34.340] you
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:34.660] exit
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:34.880] this
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.040] state,
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:35.140] you
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:35.220] get
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:35.440] minus
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:35.640] two.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:35.780] You
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:35.940] exit
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.140] this
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:36.280] state,
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:36.380] you
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:36.480] get
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:36.680] minus
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.000] two.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:37.460] You
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:37.620] exit
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:37.900] this
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:38.160] state,
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:38.920] you
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.080] get
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:39.240] R
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:39.420] equals
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:39.640] zero.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:40.200] Okay,
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:41.240] sorry
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:41.540] guys,
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:41.800] you
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:41.920] get
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.320] plus
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:42.620] 10.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:43.280] You
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:43.460] exit
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:43.680] this
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:43.900] state
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.360] repeatedly,
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:44.580] you
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:44.700] get
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:44.920] zero,
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.120] zero,
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:45.320] zero,
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:45.580] zero.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.020] Yeah,
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:47.400] last
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:47.640] question,
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:47.800] then
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:47.900] I'll
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:48.020] move
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:48.120] on.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:02.540] So
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.060] this
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:03.380] Bellman
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:03.820] equation,
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:04.520] so
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:04.800] far
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:04.980] we've
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.160] seen
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:05.320] how
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:05.460] to
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:05.640] kind
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:05.760] of
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.060] spell
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:06.300] this
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:06.500] out
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:06.900] literally
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:07.560] state
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:07.740] by
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.120] state,
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:08.480] but
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:08.600] there's
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:08.680] a
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:08.820] much
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.000] more
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.360] concise
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:09.740] formulation,
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:10.200] which
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:10.320] is
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:10.600] using
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.360] matrices
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:11.720] and
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.280] vectors.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:13.540] So
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:13.640] if
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:13.700] we
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:13.820] just
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.020] spend
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:14.140] a
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:14.340] moment
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:14.500] to
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:14.860] understand
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:15.260] that,
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:15.900] what
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:16.020] we
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:16.140] can
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:16.420] do
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:16.860] is
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:17.180] basically
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:17.460] use
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.220] this
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:18.620] matrix
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.080] formulation
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:19.260] of
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:19.320] the
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:19.660] transition
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.040] matrix,
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.280] which
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:20.420] we've
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:20.600] already
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.000] seen,
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:21.760] but
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:21.920] now
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.020] what
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:22.120] we're
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:22.200] going
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:22.240] to
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:22.380] do
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:22.500] is
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:22.620] we're
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:22.700] going
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:22.800] to
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.220] introduce
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:23.920] a
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.560] vector
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.120] representation
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:25.320] of
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:25.400] the
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:25.640] value
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:25.980] function,
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:26.860] which
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.040] is
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:27.360] the
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:27.640] obvious
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:27.940] thing.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:28.080] It's
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.500] basically
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:28.780] we
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.400] form
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:29.540] a
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:29.820] column
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:30.200] vector
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:30.980] where
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.200] each
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:31.520] element
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:31.660] of
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:31.780] the
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.000] column
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:32.400] vector
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:33.740] contains
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:34.180] the
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:34.460] value
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:34.760] function
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:34.920] of
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.020] a
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.340] specific
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:35.840] state
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:36.760] for
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.000] all
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.340] states
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:37.540] from
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:37.700] one
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:37.840] to
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.020] N.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:38.800] Okay,
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:39.600] and
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:39.700] so
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.000] now
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.320] we
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:40.440] can
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:40.660] write
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:40.880] out
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.080] our
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:41.280] Bellman
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:41.600] equation
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:41.880] very
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.400] concisely.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:42.580] It's
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:42.780] just
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.400] that
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:43.520] the
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:43.780] value
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.100] function
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:44.220] that
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:44.280] you
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:44.520] start
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:44.740] with,
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:44.920] this
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.180] column
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.420] vector
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:45.740] here
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:46.300] is
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:46.520] equal
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:46.900] to,
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:47.560] and
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:47.680] we're
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:47.700] going
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:47.740] to
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:47.840] do
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:47.960] the
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:48.100] same
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:48.280] thing
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:48.420] with
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:48.600] the
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.160] reward
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:49.480] function
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:49.640] as
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:49.760] well.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:49.900] We're
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:49.960] going
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.000] to
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.180] write
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:50.300] out
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:50.400] the
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:50.620] reward
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:50.960] function
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:51.160] with
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:51.500] one
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.420] element
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:52.740] per
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.080] state.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:53.500] This
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:53.740] tells
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:53.940] us
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:54.100] how
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.340] much
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:54.840] reward
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.000] you'll
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.120] get
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.280] from
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:55.520] exiting
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:55.820] state
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:56.160] one
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:56.660] all
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:56.740] the
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:56.820] way
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:56.980] down
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.100] to
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:57.220] how
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:57.380] much
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:57.660] reward
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:57.800] you'll
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:57.900] get
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.060] from
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:58.320] exiting
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:58.840] state
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.080] N,
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:39:59.940] so
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:00.220] forth.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.020] Okay,
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:01.180] so
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.320] this
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:01.400] is
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:01.540] your
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:01.800] immediate
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.280] reward,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.060] and
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:03.180] then
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:03.340] this
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:03.460] is
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.820] where
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.000] you'll
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:05.360] transition
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:05.700] to,
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:06.400] and
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:06.540] this
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:06.680] is
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:06.820] how
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.640] much
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:07.900] value
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:08.040] you
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:08.300] started
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:08.480] with
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:08.820] before.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:09.540] Okay,
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.200] so
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:10.280] it's
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:10.540] basically
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:10.860] telling
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.220] us
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.220] that
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:12.640] in
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.120] one
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:13.680] sweep,
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:13.880] we
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:13.980] can
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.100] just
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:14.280] look
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:14.360] at
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:14.500] this
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:14.680] thing,
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:14.780] we
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:14.840] can
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.000] say
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.140] the
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:15.420] value
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.360] of
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:16.560] this
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:16.920] state
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.420] is
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:17.640] equal
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.060] to
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:18.580] the
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:18.860] immediate
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:19.360] reward
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:20.700] plus
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.000] the
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:21.400] transition
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:21.980] matrix.
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:23.020] So
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.180] these
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:23.280] are
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:23.420] all
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:23.520] the
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:23.740] places
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:23.900] we
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:24.060] might
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:24.480] transition
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:24.820] to,
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:25.280] and
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:25.380] then
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:25.520] this
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:25.600] is
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:25.740] the
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:25.960] value
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.100] of
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:26.200] where
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:26.340] we
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:26.500] end
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:26.720] up.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:27.500] Okay,
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:27.620] this
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:27.720] is
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:27.860] the
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.120] value
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:28.280] of,
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:28.460] you
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:28.540] know,
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:28.840] after
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:28.960] I've
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.140] taken
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:29.260] a
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:29.460] step,
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:29.620] I
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:29.780] might
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:29.940] end
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:30.080] up
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:30.200] in
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:30.360] this
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:30.560] state,
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:30.700] I
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:30.820] might
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:30.940] end
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:31.060] up
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:31.140] in
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:31.280] this
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:31.440] state,
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:31.560] I
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:31.660] might
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:31.760] end
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:31.860] up
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:31.960] in
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:32.120] this
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:32.360] state,
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.020] and
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:33.240] each
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:33.500] row
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:33.620] of
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:33.800] this
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.040] thing
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.020] is
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.140] going
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:35.240] to
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:35.360] be
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:35.520] dot
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:35.960]-producted
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.120] with
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:36.280] these
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:36.680] values.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:37.300] There's
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:37.500] some
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:37.900] probability
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:38.100] if
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:38.240] I'm
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:38.340] in
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:38.520] this
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:38.840] state
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:40.340] that
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:40.480] I
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:40.620] end
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:40.740] up
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:40.840] in
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:40.980] each
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:41.100] of
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:41.420] these
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:41.960] successor
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.340] states,
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:42.480] and
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:42.560] then
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:42.640] we
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:42.780] take
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:42.900] the
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.020] dot
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:43.220] product
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:43.420] of
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:43.680] that
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.180] with
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:44.340] all
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:44.420] of
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:44.520] the
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:44.840] values
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.000] of
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.120] where
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:45.240] we
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:45.380] end
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:45.640] up,
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.040] and
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.240] that's
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:46.300] going
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:46.380] to
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:46.500] give
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:46.640] us
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:46.860] this
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:47.140] first
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:47.520] entry
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:47.860] here.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:48.300] So
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:48.660] it
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:48.820] gives
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:49.000] us,
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:49.440] literally,
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:49.940] it's
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:50.020] a
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:50.140] way
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:50.220] of
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:50.420] writing
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:50.580] out
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:50.680] the
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:50.940] entire
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:51.160] Bellman
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:51.460] equation
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:51.720] in
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:51.960] one
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.540] very
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:52.880] concise
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.220] form.
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:54.780] Okay,
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:55.340] yeah,
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:55.600] question?
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:00.740] Yes,
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:00.920] that
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.000] should
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.120] be
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:01.560] Pn1,
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:01.800] actually,
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.040] from
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:02.140] the
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:02.300] bottom
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:02.580] left.
[00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:06.770] Okay,
[00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:07.490] so
[00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:08.170] the
[00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:08.390] Bellman
[00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.770] equation
[00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:09.250] is
[00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:09.370] a
[00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:09.570] linear
[00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:10.010] equation.
[00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:10.890] As
[00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:10.970] a
[00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:11.250] result,
[00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:11.410] it
[00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:11.510] can
[00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.670] be
[00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:12.010] solved
[00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:12.610] directly.
[00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:13.670] It's
[00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.750] one
[00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.830] of
[00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:13.890] the
[00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:14.050] nice
[00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:14.230] things
[00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.470] about
[00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.710] linear
[00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:15.110] equations.
[00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.350] This
[00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:15.570] is
[00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:15.750] not
[00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.910] going
[00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:16.010] to
[00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.130] be
[00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.290] true
[00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:16.490] once
[00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.590] we
[00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:16.770] move
[00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:17.070] to
[00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:17.970] the
[00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:18.110] more
[00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:18.390] complex
[00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.690] case
[00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:18.810] with
[00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.090] Markov
[00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:19.390] decision
[00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.890] processes.
[00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:20.510] It's
[00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.590] a
[00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:20.790] nice
[00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:21.090] property
[00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:21.270] of
[00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.610] just
[00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:22.350] evaluating
[00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:22.570] the
[00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:22.890] rewards,
[00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:23.090] but
[00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:23.290] once
[00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:23.370] we
[00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:23.530] want
[00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:23.650] to
[00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:23.990] maximize
[00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.530] rewards,
[00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.710] it
[00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.910] gets
[00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:25.370] harder.
[00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:26.170] But
[00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:26.290] at
[00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:26.450] this
[00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.730] stage,
[00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.870] at
[00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:27.010] least,
[00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.150] we
[00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.290] can
[00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.490] solve
[00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:27.670] this
[00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:28.110] directly.
[00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:28.970] Assuming
[00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:29.270] that
[00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.630] our
[00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.910] matrix
[00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:30.170] is
[00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.410] small
[00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.630] enough
[00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:30.810] to
[00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:31.130] invert,
[00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:31.830] what
[00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:31.950] we
[00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:32.050] can
[00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:32.230] do
[00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.370] is
[00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:32.570] just
[00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:32.810] write
[00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:33.030] out
[00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.210] our
[00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:33.430] linear
[00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.810] equation
[00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:34.130] now.
[00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.950] All
[00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:35.110] we're
[00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:35.150] going
[00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.210] to
[00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:35.330] do
[00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:35.450] is
[00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.790] collect
[00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:36.250] together
[00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:36.810] the
[00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:36.970] V
[00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:37.310] terms
[00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:37.510] here.
[00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:37.690] So
[00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:37.830] we've
[00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:38.190] got,
[00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.330] if
[00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:39.430] you
[00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.550] like,
[00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:39.990] identity
[00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.370] times
[00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.590] V
[00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:40.950] here,
[00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.850] and
[00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:42.030] gamma
[00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.290] P
[00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:42.590] times
[00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:42.810] V
[00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:43.090] here.
[00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:43.630] So
[00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.730] we
[00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.950] collect
[00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:44.170] those
[00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:44.470] together
[00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.670] on
[00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:44.830] this
[00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:45.150] side,
[00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.550] I
[00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.830] minus
[00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:46.070] gamma
[00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.370] P,
[00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:47.350] V
[00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:47.750] equals
[00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:48.050] R,
[00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.490] and
[00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:48.590] then
[00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:48.670] we
[00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.830] just
[00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:49.110] invert
[00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:49.350] this
[00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:49.630] matrix.
[00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.550] Okay,
[00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:53.110] and
[00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:54.730] this
[00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:54.850] is
[00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:54.990] the
[00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.350] solution
[00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:55.630] to
[00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.890] the
[00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:56.930] MDP.
[00:41:58.930 --> 00:41:59.490] The
[00:41:59.490 --> 00:41:59.930] computational
[00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:00.490] complexity
[00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:00.890] of
[00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:01.390] inverting
[00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.570] this
[00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:01.890] matrix
[00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:02.270] is
[00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.750] n
[00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:03.130] cubed
[00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:03.790] for
[00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:03.990] n
[00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.430] states.
[00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:05.010] So
[00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:05.170] this
[00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:05.310] is
[00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:05.590] not
[00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:06.070] typically
[00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:06.290] a
[00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:06.670] practical
[00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:07.150] solution
[00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.510] method
[00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.710] for
[00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:08.230] large
[00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.050] Markov
[00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.470] processes.
[00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.230] So
[00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.350] what
[00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:10.450] we'll
[00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:10.630] start
[00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.770] to
[00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:10.930] look
[00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:11.050] at
[00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:11.190] in
[00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.510] subsequent
[00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.870] lectures
[00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:12.050] is
[00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.410] efficient
[00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.690] ways
[00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:12.870] to
[00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:13.110] solve
[00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:13.390] these
[00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.910] problems.
[00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:15.030] In
[00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.450] particular,
[00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:16.150] this
[00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.270] is
[00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.430] just
[00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.550] going
[00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.550] to
[00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.630] be
[00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.730] a
[00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:16.950] building
[00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:17.170] block.
[00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:17.390] All
[00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.470] of
[00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.550] the
[00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.710] things
[00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.850] we've
[00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:17.990] seen
[00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.150] so
[00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.350] far
[00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:18.450] are
[00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:18.590] just
[00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:18.910] building
[00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:19.190] blocks
[00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.430] towards
[00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.650] what
[00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:19.750] we
[00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.950] really
[00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:20.150] care
[00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.390] about,
[00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.570] which
[00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:20.670] is
[00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:20.890] making
[00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:21.350] decisions.
[00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.430] And
[00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.550] so
[00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.710] this
[00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.810] is
[00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:22.950] just
[00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:23.070] going
[00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:23.070] to
[00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:23.170] be
[00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:23.230] a
[00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.410] building
[00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:23.570] block.
[00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.730] We
[00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:23.970] need
[00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:24.070] to
[00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:24.170] be
[00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.270] able
[00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.390] to
[00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.730] efficiently
[00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:25.010] figure
[00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.270] out
[00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.530] what's
[00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:25.630] the
[00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.870] value
[00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:25.990] of
[00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.110] being
[00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:26.250] in
[00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:26.390] this
[00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.670] state.
[00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:27.270] We
[00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.530] can't
[00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.770] always
[00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:28.070] do
[00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:28.590] this.
[00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:29.690] But
[00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.790] it
[00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.950] is
[00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:30.150] nice
[00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.310] to
[00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:30.470] know
[00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.650] that
[00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:30.810] for
[00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:31.150] small
[00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.890] Markov
[00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:32.070] reward
[00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:32.410] processes,
[00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:32.590] we
[00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:32.730] can
[00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:33.030] just
[00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.390] invert
[00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.590] this
[00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:33.810] thing,
[00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:34.010] and
[00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.250] it
[00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.430] gives
[00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.550] us
[00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.690] some
[00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:35.010] intuition
[00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:35.250] into
[00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:35.470] what's
[00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:35.630] going
[00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.830] on.
[00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:37.630] So
[00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.890] later,
[00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.090] we'll
[00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:38.310] talk
[00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:38.710] about
[00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:39.230] our
[00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.450] next
[00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:39.770] lecture.
[00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:39.950] In
[00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:40.110] fact,
[00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:40.290] the
[00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:40.410] next
[00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:40.670] class
[00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.830] is
[00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:41.110] dynamic
[00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:41.530] programming.
[00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.590] That's
[00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:42.650] a
[00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:42.790] very
[00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.990] well
[00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.150]-known
[00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.470] class
[00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.610] of
[00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:43.850] methods
[00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:44.050] for
[00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:44.350] basically
[00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:44.690] doing
[00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.870] this
[00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:45.070] more
[00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:45.430] efficiently.
[00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.710] And
[00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:47.110] then
[00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:47.210] we'll
[00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.390] talk
[00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.570] about
[00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:47.790] Monte
[00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:48.070] Carlo
[00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:48.610] evaluation
[00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:48.790] and
[00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.970] temporal
[00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:49.290] difference
[00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:49.510] learning.
[00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:49.750] That's
[00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.930] like,
[00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:50.090] you
[00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:50.210] know,
[00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.450] the
[00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:50.610] next
[00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:50.810] couple
[00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.910] of
[00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:51.190] lectures
[00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.350] are
[00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:51.630] basically
[00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.890] doing
[00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:52.250] exactly
[00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.550] that.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.280] Right.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:56.840] So
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.240] that
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:57.360] was
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:57.560] sort
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:57.660] of
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:57.880] the
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.380] elementary
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:58.700] building
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:58.980] blocks
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.380] leading
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:42:59.600] up
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:42:59.700] to
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:42:59.880] this
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.140] point,
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:00.360] which
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:00.500] is
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:00.660] the
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:01.000] MDP.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:01.620] This
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:01.720] is
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:01.840] the
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:01.980] thing
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.160] which
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:02.280] we
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:02.480] actually
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:02.760] use
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:02.880] in
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.280] reinforcement
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:03.640] learning.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:05.640] And
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.000] so
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.220] I
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:07.360] guess
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:07.480] I
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:07.600] should
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:07.780] pause.
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:07.960] Any
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.300] questions
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:08.500] so
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:08.680] far?
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:09.840] I
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:09.960] guess
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.140] we've
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:10.280] been
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:10.640] doing
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:10.800] them
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:10.920] as
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.020] we
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:11.180] go.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:15.480] Right.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.300] So
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:16.480] the
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:16.940] MDP,
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:17.680] we're
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:17.920] basically
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.080] going
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.140] to
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:18.340] add
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:18.540] in
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.280] one
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:19.460] more
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:19.640] piece
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:19.760] of
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.140] complexity
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:20.440] now,
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:20.600] which
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:20.700] is
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:20.980] actions.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:21.360] So
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:21.540] so
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:21.760] far,
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:21.920] there's
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.060] been
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:22.260] nothing
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:22.460] for
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:22.560] us
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:22.680] to
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:22.840] do.
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:22.980] You
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.080] know,
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:23.500] I
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:23.660] just
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:23.880] told
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:23.960] you,
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:24.040] you
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:24.140] get
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:24.400] plonked
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:24.620] down
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:24.760] in
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.040] your
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.360] student
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.240] Markov
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:27.420] reward
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:27.760] process,
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:28.400] and
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:28.500] you
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:28.640] just
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:28.940] randomly
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:29.260] sample
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:29.460] these
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:29.840] transitions
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.060] and
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:30.200] get
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:30.480] spat
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:30.680] out
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:30.800] at
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:30.880] the
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.020] other
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.300] end.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:31.680] You
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:31.840] didn't
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.260] have
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:33.440] any
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:33.820] agency.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:34.060] You
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:34.200] weren't
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:34.440] able
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:34.600] to
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:34.800] take
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.100] actions
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:35.240] and
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:35.380] make
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:35.720] decisions.
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:36.460] So
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:36.680] let's
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:36.820] now
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.100] change
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:37.300] that.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:37.500] Let's
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:37.800] introduce
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.240] decisions.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:39.280] So
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:39.400] what
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:39.560] we're
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:39.600] going
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:39.640] to
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:39.780] do
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:39.980] now
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:40.120] is
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:40.420] basically
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:40.740] take
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:40.860] our
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.140] Markov
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:41.360] reward
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:41.880] process,
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:42.500] which
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:42.640] was
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:42.780] a
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:42.980] state
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.360]-space
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.020] transition
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:44.540] matrix,
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.100] reward
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:45.460] function
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:45.640] and
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:45.860] discount
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:46.340] factor.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:46.800] We're
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:46.940] adding
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.160] one
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:47.340] more
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:47.700] component,
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:48.000] which
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.140] is
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:48.540] the
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:48.860] action
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:49.280] space.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:51.180] So
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:51.520] A
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:51.660] is
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:51.900] now
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:52.260] a
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:52.560] finite
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:52.840] set
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:52.980] of
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.380] actions.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:53.960] In
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.100] the
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:54.460] extensions
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:54.720] to
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:54.840] the
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.060] class,
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:55.220] you'll
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:55.380] see
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:55.520] how
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:55.680] this
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:55.800] can
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:55.920] be
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.180] made
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.020] continuous
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:57.320] or
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:57.620] infinite.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:00.960] But
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.480] for
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:01.620] now,
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:01.780] we'll
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.060] consider
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:02.220] the
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:02.460] simplest
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:02.800] case.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:03.000] This
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:03.100] is
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:03.420] a
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:03.840] discrete
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.700] set
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:04.840] of
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.240] actions,
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.480] finite
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:06.980] size.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:08.220] And
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:08.340] so
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:08.560] now
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:08.720] what
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:08.880] we're
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:08.920] going
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:08.980] to
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:09.280] do
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:09.560] is
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:09.740] say
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:10.260] the
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:10.620] transition
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.000] probability
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:11.560] matrix
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:11.980] now
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:12.420] depends
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:12.640] on
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:12.820] which
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:13.180] action
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:13.320] we
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:13.620] take.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:14.480] So
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:14.840] where
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:14.980] you
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:15.140] end
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:15.360] up
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:15.480] is
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:15.620] now
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:15.780] going
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:15.880] to
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.300] depend
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.020] on
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:17.220] the
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:17.460] action
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:17.580] that
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:17.660] you
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:18.000] take.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:18.340] If
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:18.380] you
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:18.560] take,
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.020] if
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:19.080] you
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:19.240] move
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:19.360] to
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:19.500] the
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:19.760] left,
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:20.780] the
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:21.140] probability
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:21.320] that
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:21.340] you
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:21.460] end
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:21.560] up
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:21.640] in
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:21.740] all
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:21.840] these
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.100] different
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:22.360] states
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:22.500] is
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:22.600] going
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:22.620] to
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:22.800] be
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.280] different
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:23.480] if
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:23.600] you
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:23.780] choose
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:23.920] to
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.060] move
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:24.160] to
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:24.260] the
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:24.560] right.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:25.040] You
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.100] know,
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:25.200] the
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:25.340] wind
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:25.540] might
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:25.800] blow
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:25.940] you
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.180] different
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:26.460] ways
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:26.560] in
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:26.720] each
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.080] case,
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.000] but
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:28.180] you
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:28.380] have
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:28.560] some
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:28.920] agency
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.200] over
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:29.380] where
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:29.560] you're
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:29.580] going
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:29.640] to
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:29.780] end
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:29.980] up.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:30.720] So
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:30.840] the
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:30.940] way
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:31.060] we
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:31.240] think
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:31.360] of
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:31.540] this
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:31.660] is
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:31.780] that
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:31.880] it's
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.040] just
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.440] one
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:32.700] in
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:32.800] the
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.060] discrete
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:33.340] case.
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:33.500] There's
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:33.640] like
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.000] one
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.980] separate
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.520] matrix
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:35.860] of
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:36.260] transition
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:36.780] probabilities
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:37.060] for
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:37.300] each
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:37.660] action
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:37.800] that
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:37.900] you
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.060] might
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:38.320] take.
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:39.900] And
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.020] now
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:40.140] we've
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:40.240] got
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:40.420] this
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:40.680] reward
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.120] function.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:41.920] The
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.120] reward
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:42.480] function,
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:42.780] again,
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.020] may
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:44.320] depend
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:44.460] on
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:44.560] the
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:44.820] action.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:45.500] It
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:45.620] may
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:45.800] also
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:45.980] not
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.240] depend
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:46.320] on
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:46.440] the
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:46.580] action.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:47.760] But
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.160] in
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:48.420] general,
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:48.620] this
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:48.760] thing
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:48.900] can
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.120] depend
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:49.220] on
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:49.320] the
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:49.520] action.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:50.680] Apart
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:50.840] from
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:50.980] that,
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:51.280] everything
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:51.460] is
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:51.600] the
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:51.800] same.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:51.960] The
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.180] machinery
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:52.340] is
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:52.460] the
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:52.620] same.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:52.800] We've
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:52.960] just
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:53.320] introduced
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:53.700] actions
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:53.880] in
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:53.980] the
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:54.200] simplest
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:54.540] possible
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:54.820] way.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.400] So
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:57.800] what
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:57.960] we're
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.000] going
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.040] to
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:58.180] do
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:58.300] is
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:58.580] actually
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.200] redo
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.240] our
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:00.760] student
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.540] marker
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.020] process
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:02.220] now,
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:02.340] but
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:02.500] as
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:02.620] an
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:02.980] MDP,
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:03.260] where
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:03.600] there's
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:03.920] decisions
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.140] that
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:04.220] you
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:04.340] can
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:04.600] take.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:05.400] So
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:05.820] the
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.140] decisions
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:06.340] are
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:06.580] now
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:07.080] these
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:07.500] red
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.820] labels
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.080] on
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:09.240] the
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.080] arcs.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:10.220] And
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:10.440] so
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:10.780] the
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:10.960] point
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.220] now
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:11.360] is
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:11.480] that
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:11.560] you
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:11.880] actually
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.300] have
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:12.480] some
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:12.820] agency
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:13.220] here.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:13.760] And
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:13.920] so
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.120] from
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:14.280] this
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:14.480] state,
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:14.600] you

[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:15.360] either
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:15.720] study.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.140] That's
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:16.240] a
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:16.500] choice
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:16.800] now.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:17.780] So
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:17.880] there's
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.040] no

[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:20.840] If

[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:22.360] this
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:22.620] state.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:24.160] If
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:24.280] you
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:24.520] choose
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:24.620] to

[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.160] state.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:27.680] When

[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:33.700] study
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.000] again.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:34.240] You
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:34.380] can
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:34.600] choose
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:34.740] to

[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:37.400] If
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:37.520] you
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:37.680] choose
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:37.800] to
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:37.900] go
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:37.980] to

[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:38.320] pub,
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:38.720] that's
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:38.820] the
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:38.980] only
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.280] place
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:39.520] now
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:39.900] that
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.160] there's
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.300] any
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:40.840] randomness.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:41.180] If
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:41.240] you
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:41.420] choose
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:41.520] to
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:41.640] go
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:41.740] to
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:41.860] the
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.080] pub,
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:42.480] who
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:42.680] knows
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:42.820] what
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:42.980] might
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:43.260] happen?
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:43.620] You
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:43.720] know,
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:43.920] maybe
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.020] you'll
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:44.180] drink
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:44.360] one
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:44.460] or
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:44.580] two
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:44.860] beers.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.040] Not
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:45.240] quite
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:45.480] sure.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:46.920] So
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.320] now
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:47.700] there's
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:47.860] some
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:48.260] probability
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:48.520] that
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:48.800] you'll
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.260] end
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:49.420] up
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:49.600] going
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:49.820] back
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:50.000] to
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:50.360] class
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:50.660] one,
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:50.960] going
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.140] back
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:51.260] to
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:51.480] class
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:51.840] two,
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:52.560] or
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:52.740] even
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:52.940] going
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:53.100] back
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:53.220] to
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:53.420] class
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:53.660] three.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.060] Okay.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.240] So
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:57.640] there's
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:57.740] a
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:57.840] lot
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.020] more
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:58.500] control
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:58.720] that
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:58.860] you
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.020] can
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:45:59.320] exert
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:45:59.560] now
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:45:59.800] over
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.160] your
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:00.560] path
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:00.780] through
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:00.980] this
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:01.300] MDP.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:01.720] This
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:01.860] is
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.280] the
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:02.600] reality
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:02.800] for
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:02.880] an
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.140] agent.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:03.860] And
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.020] the
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:04.480] goal
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:04.700] is,
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:04.820] the
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:05.000] game
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.180] we're
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:05.480] playing
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:05.680] now,
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:05.800] is
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:05.900] to
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:06.080] try
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:06.220] and
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:06.600] find
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.160] the
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:07.380] best
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:07.820] path
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:08.640] through
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.320] your
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:09.700] decision
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:09.940]-making
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:10.360] process
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:10.600] that
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.200] maximizes
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:11.380] the
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:11.540] sum
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:11.660] of
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:11.980] rewards
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:12.100] that
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:12.180] you
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:12.400] get.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:13.100] That's
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:13.200] the
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:13.420] game
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:13.580] that
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:13.660] you
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:13.840] play
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:13.960] in
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:14.040] an
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:14.300] MDP.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:15.980] Okay.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:16.940] So
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.080] to
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:17.240] do
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:17.420] that,
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:17.580] the
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:17.740] first
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:17.880] thing
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:17.960] we
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.080] need
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:18.200] to
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:18.400] talk
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:18.680] about
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:18.940] is
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:19.860] formalizing
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:20.040] what
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:20.160] it
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:20.360] means
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:20.500] to
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:20.640] make
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.160] decisions
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:21.400] and
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:21.480] to
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:21.640] take
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:22.080] decisions.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:22.580] And
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:22.680] to
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:22.800] do
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:22.960] that,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:23.080] we
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:23.360] define
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:23.760] something
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.240] called
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:24.400] the
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:24.760] policy.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:25.480] So
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:25.640] the
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:25.960] policy
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.520] is
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:26.980] basically,
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:28.000] we
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.080] can
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.240] talk
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:28.380] about
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:28.820] stochastic
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.200] policies
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:29.540] today.
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.120] And
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:30.320] these
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:30.700] policies
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:30.960] are
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:31.680] distributions
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.300] over
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:32.760] actions
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.040] given
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:33.460] states.
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:34.220] So
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:34.320] in
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:34.480] other
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:34.760] words,
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.220] if
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:35.380] you're
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:35.480] in
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:35.700] some
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.020] state
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:36.420] S,
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:37.580] this
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:38.000] distribution
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:38.360] basically
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:38.560] gives
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:38.640] you
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:38.760] the
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.040] mapping.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:39.240] It
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:39.480] says,
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:39.840] like,
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:39.920] if
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.040] I'm
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:40.140] in
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:40.320] this
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:40.660] state,
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:41.940] map
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.200] from
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:42.400] that
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:42.740] state
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.120] to
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:43.520] some
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.020] probability
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:44.180] of
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:44.340] going
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:44.580] left
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:44.740] and
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:44.900] some
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:45.260] probability
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:45.400] of
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:45.540] going
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:45.840] right.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:46.300] So
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:46.460] this
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:46.560] is
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:46.680] the
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:46.860] thing
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.000] that
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.220] tells
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:47.480] me,
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:47.840] if
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:47.920] I'm
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.040] in
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:48.280] class
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:48.540] one,
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.060] I
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:49.220] am
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:49.380] going
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:49.540] to
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:49.840] choose
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.260] to
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:50.960] go
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.080] to
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:51.340] class
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:51.560] two
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:51.700] with
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.020] probability
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:52.300] 0
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:52.600].9
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:52.740] and
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:52.820] to
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:52.940] go
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:53.020] on
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:53.100] to
[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:53.440] Facebook
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:53.680] with
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:53.940] probability
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:54.200] 0
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:54.500].1.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.060] This
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:55.160] is
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:55.360] something
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:55.560] under
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:55.680] the
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.020] agent's
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:56.320] control.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:56.600] It's
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:56.740] something
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:56.920] we
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.360] decide.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:57.880] And
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.020] it's
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:58.220] just
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:58.500] a
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.080] stochastic
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.060] transition
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:00.500] matrix.
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:01.060] And
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:01.180] it's
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:01.480] useful
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:01.640] to
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:01.800] make
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:01.880] it
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.340] stochastic
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:02.560] because
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:02.700] that
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:02.980] allows
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.120] us
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.220] to
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:03.340] do
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:03.500] things
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:03.680] like
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.180] exploration.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:04.480] So
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:04.600] we'll
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:04.900] make
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:05.100] use
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:05.200] of
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:05.320] that
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:05.580] later
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:05.780] in
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:05.940] the
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.880] course.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:09.480] So
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:09.760] once
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:09.860] you
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.000] have
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:10.120] a
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:10.360] policy,
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:10.520] it
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:10.860] completely
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.320] defines
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:11.500] how
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:11.640] that
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:11.880] agent
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.040] will
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:12.440] behave.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:15.560] And
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:15.820] in
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:15.940] an
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:16.220] MDP,
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:17.400] the
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:17.780] policies
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.200] depend
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.060] just
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:19.200] on
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:19.300] the
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:19.460] current
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:19.720] state.
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:19.880] That
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:19.960] was
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.100] the
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:20.380] Markov
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:20.740] property.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:21.680] Doesn't
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:21.920] depend
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.040] on
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:22.140] the
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:22.420] history.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:23.160] And
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:23.360] as
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:23.460] a
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:23.840] result,
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:24.520] we
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:24.920] consider
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.520] what
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:25.640] we
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:25.760] call
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.200] stationary
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:26.720] policies.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:27.120] We
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:27.300] don't
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:27.620] consider...
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:29.880] So
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:30.220] all
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:30.320] of
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:30.440] the
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:30.880] policies,
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:31.280] the
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:31.500] policy
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:31.620] is
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:31.760] the
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.040] same
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:32.140] no
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:32.340] matter
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:32.580] what
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:32.840] time
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:33.060] step
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:33.240] we're
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:33.440] in
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.020] in
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:34.120] the
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:34.380] MDP.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:34.640] We
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:34.820] just
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:34.960] have
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.080] the
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:35.260] same
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:35.620] policy
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:35.760] at
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:35.940] each
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:36.160] time
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:36.460] step.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.080] And
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:37.180] the
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:37.340] only
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:37.520] thing
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:37.620] that
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:37.740] this
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.060] depends
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:38.340] on
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:38.860] is
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:38.980] the
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.200] state
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:39.320] that
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:39.480] we're
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:39.680] in,
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.020] not
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:40.180] the
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:40.360] time
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:40.600] step
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:40.700] at
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:40.840] which
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:40.960] it
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.260] happened.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.160] And
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:42.380] that's
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:42.700] sufficient
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:42.960] to
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.260] behave
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:43.720] optimally
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.200] because
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:44.400] by
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:44.820] definition,
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:45.060] we
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:45.400] have
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:45.540] the

[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:47.260] S

[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:48.620] will
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:48.800] happen
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:49.160] next.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.120] Yeah,
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:50.440] question.
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:47:59.460] The
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:47:59.760] question
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.000] was,
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:00.160] why
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:00.280] are
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:00.360] there
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:00.500] no
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:00.940] rewards
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:01.120] in
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.300] this
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:01.700] equation?
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:02.980] And
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.160] that's
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:03.320] because
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:03.520] the

[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:06.180] rewards.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:06.780] So
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:06.920] in
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.040] a
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:07.340] Markov

[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:11.380] means
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:11.520] that
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:11.700] S
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:11.960] fully
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:12.520] characterizes
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:12.700] the

[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:13.380] from
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:13.580] this

[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.200] onwards
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.540] in

[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:16.640] And
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:16.740] so
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:16.840] what
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:16.960] you're
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.140] looking
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:17.420] for
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:17.580] is
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:17.700] the

[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:18.820] which
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:19.080] given
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:19.240] the
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:19.440] state
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:19.620] you're
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:19.840] in,
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:20.500] well,
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:21.200] you
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:21.320] want
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:21.420] to
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:21.560] pick
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:21.920] actions
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:22.060] that
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:22.160] will
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:22.300] get
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:22.420] you

[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.080] So
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:24.300] all
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:24.400] you
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:24.500] need
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:24.600] to
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:24.760] look
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:24.880] at
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:25.000] is

[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:25.400] state
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:25.520] am
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:25.640] I
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:25.800] in
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.000] and
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:26.140] what
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:26.420] action
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:26.580] should
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:26.680] I
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:26.860] take
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:27.180] next?
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:27.620] And
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:27.720] we're
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:27.840] trying
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:27.960] to
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.100] pick
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:28.280] those
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:28.560] actions
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:28.720] in
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:28.800] the
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.040] way
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:29.580] given
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:29.780] that
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:30.060] state
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:30.240] that
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:30.340] will
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:30.440] get
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:30.540] us
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:30.660] the
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:30.820] most
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.140] future
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:31.440] reward.
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.220] So
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:32.320] the
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:32.560] rewards
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:32.660] are
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:32.760] in
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:32.860] the
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:33.120] future.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:33.400] We
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:33.520] don't
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:33.700] care
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:33.880] about
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.040] how
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:34.160] many
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:34.400] rewards
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:34.520] we've
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:34.620] got
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:34.700] in
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:34.800] the
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.120] past.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:35.700] Those
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:35.980] rewards
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:36.120] have
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:36.280] gone
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:36.460] now.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:36.620] They've
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:36.760] been
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.200] consumed.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.180] All
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:38.320] we
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:38.480] care
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:38.660] about
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:38.780] is
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:38.920] how
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.080] much
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:39.300] reward
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:39.440] we
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:39.560] can
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:39.700] get
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:39.880] from
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.100] now
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:40.260] into
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:40.380] the
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:40.640] future.
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:41.340] So
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:41.440] we
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:41.580] don't
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:41.800] actually
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.200] care
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:42.820] when
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:42.920] we
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:43.040] try
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:43.200] to
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:43.440] maximize
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:43.700] this
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:43.840] thing.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:43.960] We
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.160] don't
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.420] care
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:44.560] if
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:44.620] we're
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:45.040] currently,
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:45.560] if
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:45.700] we've
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:45.920] already
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.300] achieved
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:46.440] a
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:46.600] million
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:46.960] reward
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.120] or
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:47.360] minus
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:47.520] a
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:47.660] million
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:47.920] reward.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.160] That's
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:48.460] irrelevant.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:48.700] What
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:48.820] we
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:48.960] want
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.080] to
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:49.200] do
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:49.380] is
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:50.200] maximize
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:50.460] the
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:50.680] reward
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:50.860] from
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:51.020] now
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:51.300] onwards.
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:51.960] That's
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.060] the
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:52.160] way
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:52.340] we're
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:52.340] going
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:52.400] to
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:52.660] behave
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:53.240] optimally.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:00.440] Yes,
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:00.800] yes,
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:01.600] exactly.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:04.960] OK,
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:05.320] so
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:05.460] one
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:05.760] important
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:05.940] thing
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:06.080] to
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:06.260] note
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:06.540] about
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:07.440] the

[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.020] between

[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:11.880] is
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.120] that
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:12.480] we
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:12.600] can
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:12.980] always

[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:15.780] from
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.080] our
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:16.600] decision
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.100] process.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:17.880] So
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:18.040] just
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:18.160] to
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:18.480] understand
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:18.840] that,
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:19.960] we
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.080] can
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:20.280] think
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:20.540] about
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:20.920] basically
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.140] the

[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:23.240] draw.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:23.700] Like
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:23.820] if
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:23.920] we
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.280] have
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:24.520] some
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:24.920] policy
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.320] that

[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:25.680] us

[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.260] actions,
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:26.840] we're
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:26.940] just
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:27.040] going
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:27.100] to
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:27.340] draw

[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:29.540] And

[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:30.860] draw
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.200] when
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:31.340] we
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:31.580] follow
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:31.740] our

[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.560] process
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.300] is
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:33.580] actually
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:33.720] a

[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:34.740] It's
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:34.800] a

[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:35.760] itself.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.120] No
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.260] matter
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:36.520] what
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:36.820] policy
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:36.980] we
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.260] choose,
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:37.740] that

[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.040] defines

[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:40.760] defines
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:40.900] our

[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:41.460] the

[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:41.720] that
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:41.880] we're
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:41.960] going
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:42.000] to

[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:45.480] And
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:45.800] if
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:45.880] we
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.060] look
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:46.140] at

[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:08.100] We're
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:08.180] just
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:08.300] going

[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:11.980] So
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:12.500] we're
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:12.520] going

[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:19.160] So
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:19.280] if

[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:28.940].5
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:29.180] times
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:29.300] the
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:29.600] probability
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:29.760] of
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:29.860] all
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:29.980] the
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:30.200] states
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:30.320] that
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:30.460] I'm
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:30.500] going
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:30.600] to
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:30.780] end
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:30.920] up
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.020] in
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:31.180] over
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:31.480] here,
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:32.220] sum
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:32.420] those
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:32.760] together
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.180] and
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:33.360] those
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:33.820] average
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:34.340] dynamics
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.180] define
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:35.800] some
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.340] Markov
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:36.580] reward
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:37.020] process.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:38.780] So
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:38.880] we
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:38.980] can
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:39.220] always
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:39.620] flatten
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:39.800] our
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.140] MDP
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:40.580] given
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:40.740] our
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:40.980] current
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:41.400] policy
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:41.960] back
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:42.140] into
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:42.280] a
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:42.480] Markov
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:42.800] chain.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:45.300] This
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:45.420] is
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:45.560] just
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:45.680] a
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:45.900] useful
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:46.200] point.
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:46.380] It's
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:46.600] not
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:46.860] like
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:47.140] central.
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:47.480] So
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.420] you
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:48.520] can
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:48.660] come
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:48.820] back
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:48.920] to
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.040] this
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:49.160] and
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:49.320] think
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:49.520] about
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:49.640] it
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:49.960] offline
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.120] if
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:50.200] you
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:50.360] like.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:52.720] Okay,
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.100] what
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:53.280] is
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:53.520] central
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:53.700] is
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:53.820] the
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.240] concept
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:54.400] of
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:54.500] the
[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:54.680] value
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.040] function.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:55.480] So
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:55.600] we
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:55.760] already
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:55.960] had
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:56.080] the
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:56.260] value
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:56.560] function
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:56.880] for
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:57.000] a
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.260] Markov
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:57.520] reward
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:57.900] process,
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:58.060] but
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:58.180] there
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:58.280] was
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:58.460] no
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:58.860] agency
[00:50:58.860 --> 00:50:59.080] there.
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:50:59.160] There
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:50:59.240] was
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:50:59.360] no
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:50:59.720] decisions.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:00.720] Now
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:00.920] we've
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:01.020] got
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:01.180] this
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:01.520] policy.
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:01.740] There's
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:01.900] some
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:02.120] way
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:02.240] that
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:02.340] we
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:02.480] can
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:02.660] choose
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:02.820] to
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:03.140] behave
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:03.320] in
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:03.480] our
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:03.980] Markov
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:04.380] process.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:04.920] You
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:04.980] know,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:05.100] I
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:05.260] might
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:05.420] be
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:05.640] following
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:05.940] this
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:06.440] path
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:06.740] straight
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:06.940] through
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:07.100] the
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:07.380] student
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:07.700] Markov
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:07.920] chain
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:08.080] where
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:08.540] I
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:09.100] collect
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:09.320] all
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:09.660] the
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.040] rewards
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:10.240] by
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:10.440] going
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:10.560] through
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:10.680] all
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:10.740] the
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:11.060] classes,
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:11.260] or
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:11.340] I
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:11.480] might
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:11.860] choose
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:12.000] to
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.200] spend
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:12.340] a
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:12.420] lot
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:12.560] of
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:12.780] time
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:12.900] on
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:13.240] Facebook.
[00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:14.220] These
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:14.320] are
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:14.400] going
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:14.460] to
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:14.580] give
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:14.860] different
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.320] rewards.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:16.160] There's
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:16.360] not
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:16.720] one
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.340] expectation
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:17.720] anymore.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:17.900] There
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:18.000] are
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:18.240] different
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:18.760] expectations
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.180] depending
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:19.340] on
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:19.520] how
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:19.620] I
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:19.900] behave.
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:20.740] And
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:20.860] so
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:21.040] we
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:21.560] subscript
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:21.720] our
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:21.940] value
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:22.340] function
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:22.960] by
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:23.180] the
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:23.580] policy
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:24.160] that
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:24.340] we're
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:24.560] interested
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:24.740] in
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.200] evaluating.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:26.260] So
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:26.520] V
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:26.900] pi
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.180] of

[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:27.620] now
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:27.940] tells
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:28.240] us
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:28.740] how
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:29.000] good
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.140] is
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:29.420] it
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:29.820] to
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:29.980] be

[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:32.500] pi.
[00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.690] So
[00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:34.790] if
[00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.970] I'm

[00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:39.190] Or
[00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.630] if

[00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:43.850] day
[00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:44.130] onwards?
[00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.970] So
[00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:46.570] this
[00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:46.950] basically
[00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:47.370] is
[00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:47.710] defined.
[00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:47.930] We've
[00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:48.030] just
[00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.150] got
[00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.310] this
[00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:48.850] expectation
[00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:49.110] here.
[00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.350] Now
[00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:49.670] this
[00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:50.190] E
[00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:50.330] pi
[00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:50.810] basically
[00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:51.030] means
[00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.150] the
[00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.750] expectation
[00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:53.130] when
[00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:53.310] we
[00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:53.630] sample
[00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.930] all
[00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:54.290] actions
[00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.610] according
[00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:54.750] to
[00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.910] this
[00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:55.170] policy
[00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:55.450] pi.
[00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:56.710] That's
[00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.870] sort
[00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.990] of
[00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.310] hidden
[00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:57.510] in
[00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.670] that
[00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.910] E
[00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:58.130] pi
[00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:58.770] notation.
[00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:00.110] We're
[00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:00.350] also
[00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:00.570] going
[00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:00.690] to
[00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:01.070] define
[00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:01.310] a
[00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:01.550] second
[00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:01.830] type
[00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:01.950] of
[00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:02.150] value
[00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.530] function
[00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:03.150] called
[00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:03.350] the
[00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:03.650] action
[00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.950] value
[00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:04.330] function.
[00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:05.250] So,
[00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:05.410] so
[00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:05.610] far
[00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:05.790] we've
[00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:05.990] got
[00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.330] the
[00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:06.550] state
[00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:06.810] value
[00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:07.150] function.
[00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.370] This
[00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.650] V
[00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:07.910] we
[00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:08.050] call
[00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:08.190] the
[00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:08.410] state
[00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:08.630] value
[00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.990] function
[00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.410] that
[00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:09.650] tells
[00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.830] us
[00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:10.010] how
[00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.250] good
[00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.350] is
[00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:10.450] it
[00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:10.530] to
[00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:10.610] be
[00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:10.690] in
[00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:10.770] a

[00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.290] state
[00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:11.570] s.
[00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.650] We're
[00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.810] also
[00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:12.970] going
[00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:13.050] to
[00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:13.350] define
[00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:13.530] the
[00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:13.830] action
[00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:14.090] value
[00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:14.490] function
[00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:14.970] which
[00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:15.190] tells
[00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.350] us
[00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:15.530] how
[00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:15.730] good
[00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:15.830] is
[00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:15.950] it
[00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:16.070] to
[00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:16.250] take
[00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.330] a
[00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:16.630] particular

[00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:18.070] state.
[00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:18.930] And
[00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:19.070] this
[00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:19.170] is
[00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:19.290] the
[00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:19.470] thing
[00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.630] which
[00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:20.130] we
[00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:20.670] intuitively
[00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:21.010] care
[00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:21.250] about
[00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:21.430] when
[00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.550] we
[00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:21.690] want
[00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:21.810] to
[00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:22.270] decide
[00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.550] which
[00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:22.910] action
[00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:23.090] should
[00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:23.210] I
[00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.470] take.
[00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:23.630] Should
[00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.750] I
[00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.930] take,
[00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:24.250] should
[00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:24.330] I
[00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:24.450] go
[00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:24.690] left
[00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:24.790] or
[00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.910] should
[00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:25.010] I
[00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.130] go
[00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.370] right?
[00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.550] Well,
[00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:25.650] I
[00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:25.730] should
[00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.950] choose
[00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:26.070] the
[00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:26.190] one
[00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:26.390] that's
[00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.510] going
[00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.570] to
[00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:26.670] give
[00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.770] me
[00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:26.950] more
[00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:27.350] reward.
[00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.270] And
[00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.370] the
[00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:28.490] way
[00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.610] I

[00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:49.210] onwards?
[00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:50.950] Okay,
[00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:52.010] that's
[00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.130] the

[00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:57.090] actions.
[00:52:58.170 --> 00:52:58.570] So
[00:52:58.570 --> 00:52:58.770] let's
[00:52:58.770 --> 00:52:58.910] make
[00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:59.070] this
[00:52:59.070 --> 00:52:59.350] concrete
[00:52:59.350 --> 00:52:59.730] again.
[00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:00.590] So
[00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:00.750] this
[00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.850] is
[00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:00.990] the
[00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.230] state
[00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.490] value
[00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:01.850] function
[00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:02.010] for
[00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:02.150] the
[00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.370] student
[00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:02.810] MDP
[00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:04.350] undiscounted.
[00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:04.670] So
[00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.790] the
[00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:05.010] discount
[00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:05.250] factor
[00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:05.390] is
[00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.630] one.
[00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:06.990] And
[00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.310] this
[00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:07.410] is
[00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:07.570] just
[00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:07.730] the
[00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:08.050] uniform
[00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:08.490] random
[00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:08.830] behavior.
[00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:09.050] So
[00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:09.170] we're
[00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.430] fixing
[00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.630] the
[00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:10.010] policy
[00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.510] to
[00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.650] say
[00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:10.810] we're
[00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:11.170] always,
[00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.370] when
[00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:11.510] we've
[00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.590] got
[00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:11.710] a
[00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.050] choice,
[00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.650] we're
[00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.850] always
[00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:12.970] going
[00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:13.070] to
[00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:13.390] randomly
[00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.750] pick
[00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:14.390] 50,
[00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.670] 50
[00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.970] between
[00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:15.170] those
[00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:15.490] choices.
[00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:17.370] Okay.
[00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:18.150] And
[00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.330] so
[00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:18.570] this
[00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:18.710] is
[00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:19.050] the
[00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:19.630] value
[00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.970] function
[00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:20.110] that
[00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:20.190] we
[00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:20.350] end
[00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:20.510] up
[00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.770] with.
[00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:21.590] We
[00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:21.810] see
[00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:22.090] that,
[00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.630] you
[00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.690] know,
[00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.830] we
[00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:22.990] end
[00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.250] up
[00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:23.630] thinking
[00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.810] it's
[00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:23.950] not
[00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:24.110] very
[00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:24.290] good
[00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.430] to
[00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:24.730] start
[00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:24.850] in
[00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:24.990] this
[00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.210] state
[00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:25.510] here
[00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.750] because
[00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.990] there's
[00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.130] a
[00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.490] high
[00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:26.870] probability
[00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:27.050] of
[00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:27.190] ending
[00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.330] up
[00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:27.430] in
[00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.530] the
[00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:27.790] Facebook
[00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:28.270] state
[00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:29.810] because
[00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:30.130] we're
[00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:30.390] choosing
[00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.650] things
[00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.930] 50,
[00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.290] 50.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:37.880] Now
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.020] what
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:38.140] we
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:38.260] can
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:38.600] define
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:38.800] is
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.080] another
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:39.320] Bellman
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:39.900] equation.
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:40.440] So
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:40.560] the
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:40.800] Bellman
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.280] equation,
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.100] we
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:42.300] saw
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:42.480] this
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:42.580] in
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:42.660] the
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:42.880] Markov
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:43.120] reward
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:43.580] process.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:44.100] Now
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:44.240] we're
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:44.320] going
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:44.420] to
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:44.880] define
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.060] a
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:45.280] Bellman
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:45.720] equation
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:46.700] for
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:46.920] these
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.200] value
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:47.680] functions
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.140] in
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:49.280] the
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:49.580] MDP
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:50.020] case.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:50.860] So
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.080] again,
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:51.220] we
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:51.320] can
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:51.460] use
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:51.600] the
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:51.800] same
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.140] idea
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:52.700] that
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:52.860] the
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.080] value
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:53.520] function
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:53.820] can
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:53.960] be
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.580] decomposed
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:54.800] into
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:54.920] an
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.180] immediate
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:55.660] reward
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:56.440] plus
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:56.860] the
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:57.320] discounted
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:57.540] value
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:57.660] at
[00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:57.740] the
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:57.900] next
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.140] state.
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:58.400] So
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:58.620] again,
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:58.820] there's
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:58.980] this
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.280] idea
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:53:59.580] that,
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:53:59.880] you
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:53:59.960] know,
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.160] wherever
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:00.380] you
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:00.640] are,
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:01.100] you
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:01.340] take
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:01.580] one
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:01.940] step
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.120] and
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:03.260] you
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:03.420] get
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:03.560] your
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:03.800] immediate
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:04.140] reward
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:04.280] for
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:04.460] that
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:04.800] step.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:05.600] And
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:05.820] then
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:05.960] you
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.100] look
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:06.180] at
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:06.280] the
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:06.480] value
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:06.600] of
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:06.720] where
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:06.820] you
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:06.980] end
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:07.220] up.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:07.640] And
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:07.740] the
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:07.880] sum
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:08.020] of
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:08.200] those
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:08.400] things
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:08.720] together
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.060] tells
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:09.200] you
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:09.340] how
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:09.500] good
[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:09.600] it
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:09.800] was
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:09.920] to
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:10.020] be
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:10.120] in
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.240] your
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:10.500] original
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:10.840] state.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:11.760] That's
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:11.940] still
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.180] true
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:12.280] in
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:12.380] an
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:12.660] MDP.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.000] Now
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:14.160] what
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:14.280] we're
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:14.580] saying
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:15.020] is
[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:15.140] that
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:15.220] you
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:15.480] start
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:15.600] in
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:15.740] this
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:16.020] state
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:16.340] and
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:16.440] we
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:16.580] know
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:16.680] that
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:16.840] we're
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.040] following
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:17.400] policy
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:17.720] pi,
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:18.500] but
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:18.600] the
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:18.800] value
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:18.920] of
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:19.040] being
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:19.200] in
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:19.340] this
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:19.600] state
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:19.760] is
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.060] still
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:20.480] the
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:20.740] immediate
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:21.020] reward
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:21.160] that
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:21.240] you
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:21.700] get
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.100] plus
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:23.460] the
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:23.780] value
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.120] of
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:24.260] your
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:24.580] successor
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:24.960] state
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.220] if
[00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:25.300] you
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:25.440] know
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:25.560] that
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:25.700] you're
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:25.760] going
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:25.840] to
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:26.000] follow
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:26.360] policy
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:26.660] pi
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:26.860] from
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:27.040] there
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:27.260] onwards.
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:28.560] So
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:28.640] we
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:28.780] just
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:29.020] look
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:29.180] at
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:29.420] what
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:29.700] happened
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:29.840] for
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:30.060] one
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:30.300] state
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:31.300] for
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:31.660] one
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:31.980] step
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:32.120] of
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:32.380] following
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:32.540] a
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:32.840] policy.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:33.480] And
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:33.580] then
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:33.700] we
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:33.920] ask
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:34.060] how
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:34.240] much
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:34.480] more
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:34.720] reward
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:34.820] will
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:34.940] I
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:35.080] get
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:35.340] following
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:35.520] that
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:35.880] policy?
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.060] And
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:37.140] we
[00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:37.300] sum
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:37.480] those
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:37.660] things
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:37.980] together.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:38.220] That
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:38.400] gives
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:38.540] us
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:38.860] the
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:39.160] Bellman
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:39.500] equation.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:40.700] We
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:40.820] can
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:40.920] do
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:41.060] the
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:41.220] same
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:41.380] thing
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:41.500] with
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:41.600] the
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:41.820] action
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.080] value
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:42.460] function,
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:42.660] with
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:43.100] these
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:43.300] Q
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:43.660] values.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:44.520] And
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:44.640] this
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:44.980] basically
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:45.320] tells
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:45.660] us
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:46.140] now
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:47.600] if
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:47.740] I'm
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:47.860] in
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:48.060] one
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:48.420] state
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:49.460] and
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:49.560] I
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:49.860] take
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:50.140] an
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:50.380] action
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:50.640] from
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:50.940] there,
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:51.600] then
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:51.700] I'll
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:51.820] get
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:52.040] some
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:52.300] immediate
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:52.720] reward
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:52.880] for
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:53.040] that
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:53.400] action,
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:53.880] for
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:54.040] that
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:54.380] specific
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:54.780] action.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:55.600] And
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:55.840] then
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:56.140] I'll
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:56.260] look
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:56.340] at
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:56.480] where
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:56.580] I
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:56.720] end
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:57.000] up
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:57.500] and
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:57.620] I
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:57.740] can
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:57.940] ask,
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:58.080] well,
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.240] what's
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:58.340] the
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:58.600] action
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.000] value
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:54:59.640] of
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.060] the
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:00.240] state
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:00.380] that
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:00.480] I
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:00.620] end
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:00.800] up
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:01.020] in
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:02.460] under
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:02.860] the
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:03.240] action
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:03.400] that
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:03.480] I
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:03.620] would
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:03.900] pick
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:04.900] from
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:05.080] that
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:05.320] point
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:05.680] onwards?
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:07.480] OK.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.080] So
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:11.480] let's
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:11.640] look
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:11.740] at
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:11.940] these
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:12.200] kind
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:12.300] of
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:12.780] pictorially
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:12.920] and
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:13.060] try
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:13.160] and
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:13.540] understand
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:13.720] them
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:13.840] with
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.000] these
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:14.180] sort
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:14.320] of
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:14.560] look
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:14.780]-ahead
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:15.160] search
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:15.640] diagrams.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.200] So
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:17.600] the
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:17.780] way
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:17.920] to
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.280] understand
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:18.500] this
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:18.640] is
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:18.860] best
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:18.980] of
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:19.060] all
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:19.180] to
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:19.580] understand
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:19.780] how
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:19.960] V
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.120] and
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:20.300] Q
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:20.620] relate
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:20.760] to
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:20.900] each
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:21.080] other.
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:21.860] So
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:21.960] if
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:22.060] you're
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:22.140] in
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:22.240] a
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:22.440] state
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:22.660] value
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.000] function
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:23.300] here,
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:23.880] really
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:24.240] what
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:24.420] it's
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:24.640] saying
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:24.760] is
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:24.840] that
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:25.000] we're
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:25.040] going
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:25.140] to
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:25.440] average
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:25.840] over,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:27.400] basically
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:27.680] we're
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:27.720] going
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:27.800] to
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:28.040] average
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:28.420] over
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.040] the
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:29.440] actions
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.620] that
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:31.720] we
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:31.920] might
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:32.280] take.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:33.640] So
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.080] there's
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:34.240] some
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:34.700] probability
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:34.940] that
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:35.040] we'll
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:35.240] take
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:35.440] this
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:35.720] action
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:35.980] here.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:36.380] These
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:36.720] black
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:36.980] dots
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:37.320] represent
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:37.680] actions
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:37.940] and
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:38.120] these
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:38.540] open
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:38.880] circles
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:39.220] represent
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:39.580] states
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:39.860] now.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:40.960] So
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:41.080] we're
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:41.220] in
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:41.440] some
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:41.880] state
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.160] here.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.040] We
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:43.240] might
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:43.500] take
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:43.900] this
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:44.720] action
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:44.960] here.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:45.360] We
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:45.520] might
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:45.700] take
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:45.900] this
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:46.160] action
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:46.420] here.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.180] The
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:47.640] probabilities
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:47.860] of
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:48.000] these
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.200] things
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:48.320] are
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:48.580] defined
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:48.760] by
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:48.880] a
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:49.160] policy.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:49.780] So
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:49.900] this
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:50.020] is
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:50.160] like
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:50.260] the
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:50.560] probability
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:50.720] I'll
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:50.820] go
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.040] left,
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:51.220] the
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:51.500] probability
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:51.680] I'll
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:51.800] go
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.100] right.
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:53.220] And
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:53.360] for
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:53.520] each
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:53.640] of
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:53.780] those
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:54.080] actions
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:54.240] we
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:54.420] might
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:54.740] take,
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:55.420] there's
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:55.560] a
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.140] Q
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:56.400] value.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:56.700] There's
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:56.800] an
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.040] action
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:57.320] value
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:57.580] telling
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:57.720] us
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:57.880] how
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:58.080] good
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:58.160] it
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:58.320] is
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:58.440] to
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:58.640] take
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:58.780] that
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:55:59.060] action
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:55:59.300] from
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:55:59.480] that
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:55:59.780] state.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:00.740] And
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:00.820] so
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:00.980] we're
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:01.220] doing
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:01.420] like
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:01.820] a
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:02.000] one
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:02.180] step
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:02.380] look
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:02.560] ahead
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:02.840] saying
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.040] that
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:03.320] state
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:03.680] value,
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:04.100] how
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:04.260] good
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:04.360] it
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:04.520] is
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:04.640] to
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.000] look
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:05.700] ahead
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:05.920] one
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.180] step,
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:06.820] look
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:06.900] at
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:07.000] the
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:07.240] action
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:07.680] values,
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:08.260] average
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:08.460] them
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:08.820] together,
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:09.260] and
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:09.400] that
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:09.620] tells
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:09.760] us
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:09.880] the
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.100] value
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:10.200] of
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:10.340] being
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:10.460] in
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:10.580] that
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:10.860] state
[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:11.020] at
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:11.120] the
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:11.280] top
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:11.500] there.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:14.520] Now
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:14.720] let's
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:14.860] do
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:15.160] the
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:15.820] converse,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:16.280] understand
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:16.420] the
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:16.660] opposite
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.080] step.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.000] So
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:18.160] what
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:18.420] happens
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:18.540] if
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:18.640] we
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:18.940] start
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:19.180] off
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:19.640] taking
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:19.900] some
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:20.220] action?
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:21.240] So
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:21.500] now
[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:21.980] the
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:22.160] root
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:22.300] of
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:22.460] this
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:22.740] tree
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:23.460] is
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.160] a
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:24.500] state,
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:24.800] and
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:24.920] we're
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:25.220] considering
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:25.400] a
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:25.720] specific
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:26.120] action
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:26.260] that
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:26.360] we
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:26.560] take
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:26.720] from
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:26.900] that
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.180] state.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:27.480] That's
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:27.580] this
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:27.800] black
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.120] circle
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:28.360] here.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:29.040] So
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.200] this
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:29.300] is
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:29.480] like
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:29.720] saying,
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:29.840] you
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:29.960] know,
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:30.820] I'm
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.180] in
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:31.380] this
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:31.820] particular
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:32.760] state
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:33.020] here,
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:33.380] and
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:33.520] I'm
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:33.860] considering,
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:34.060] I'm
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:34.260] asking
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:34.420] the
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:34.680] question,
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:34.880] how
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:35.080] good
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:35.200] is
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:35.300] it
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:35.440] to
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:35.620] go
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:35.860] right
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:36.980] from
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:37.200] that
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:37.520] state?
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:38.600] Okay,
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.000] and
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:39.140] how
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:39.320] good
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:39.460] it
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:39.720] is,
[00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:40.160] we
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:40.320] now
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:40.500] have
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:40.620] to
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:40.960] average
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.200] over
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:41.340] the
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:41.780] dynamics
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:41.940] of
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.040] our
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:42.360] MDP.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:43.280] The
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:43.660] environment
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:44.040] might
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.640] blow
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:44.800] me
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.000] over
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:45.300] here.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:45.980] The
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:46.260] environment
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:46.580] might
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:46.760] blow
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:46.900] me
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:47.080] over
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:47.380] here.
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:48.320] So
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:48.560] after
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:48.720] I've
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:48.840] gone
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.140] right,
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:49.300] I
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:49.440] might
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:49.580] get
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:49.800] blown
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:49.940] to
[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:50.080] all
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:50.200] these
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:50.500] different
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.200] situations.
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:52.380] And
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:52.480] we
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:52.640] want
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:52.780] to
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:53.060] ask
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:53.240] for
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:53.400] each
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:53.480] of
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:53.600] these
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.020] situations
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:54.200] I
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:54.340] might
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:54.480] get
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:54.700] blown
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:54.980] to,
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:55.560] how
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:55.740] good
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:55.880] is
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:55.980] it?
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:56.200] What's
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:56.320] the
[00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:56.580] value
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:56.700] of
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:56.860] being
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:56.980] in
[00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:57.240] that
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:57.860] situation
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:58.100] under
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:58.260] my
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:58.480] current,
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:56:58.940] following
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:56:59.180] my
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:56:59.960] policy
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.240] after
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:00.400] that
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:00.720] point?
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:01.620] We
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:01.960] average
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.200] over
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:02.400] all
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:02.560] these
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:02.960] things
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:04.620] using
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:04.800] the
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.300] probabilities
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:06.440] of
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:06.720] our
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.520] transition
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.060] dynamics.
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:09.020] We
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:09.300] average
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:09.480] them
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:09.860] together,
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:10.380] and
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:10.520] that
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:10.740] gives
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:10.960] us
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.440] the
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:11.700] action
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:11.960] value

[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:12.740] root
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:12.960] here.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.040] Okay,
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:16.520] so
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.920] V
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.160] is
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:18.360] telling
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:18.520] us
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:18.680] how
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:18.840] good
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:18.960] is
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.100] it
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:19.580] to
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:19.700] be
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:19.780] in
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:19.860] a
[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:20.080] particular
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:20.460] state.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:20.940] Q
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:21.080] is
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:21.280] telling
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:21.460] us
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:21.600] how
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:21.760] good
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:21.860] is
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:21.960] it
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.080] to
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:22.240] take
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:22.320] a
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:22.560] particular
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:22.980] action
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:23.480] from
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:23.580] a
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:23.720] given
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.080] state.
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:24.900] State
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.140] value
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:25.460] function,
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:25.960] action
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:26.220] value
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:26.540] function.
[00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:30.050] We
[00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:30.190] can
[00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.350] put
[00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:30.530] these
[00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.870] together
[00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:31.150] now.
[00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:31.350] So
[00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:31.470] this
[00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.590] is
[00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:31.950] basically
[00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:32.290] just
[00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:32.790] stitching
[00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:33.250] together
[00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:33.650] the
[00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:33.810] two
[00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:34.110] figures
[00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:34.290] from
[00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:34.410] the
[00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:34.590] last
[00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:34.770] two
[00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:35.150] slides.
[00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:36.250] And
[00:57:36.250 --> 00:57:36.410] now
[00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:36.530] what
[00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:36.650] we'll
[00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.850] see
[00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:36.990] is
[00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.090] we
[00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:37.230] get
[00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.410] like
[00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:37.510] a
[00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:38.030] recursion
[00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.430] that
[00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.650] helps
[00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:38.790] us
[00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:39.190] understand
[00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.410] V
[00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.590] in
[00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:39.810] terms
[00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:39.930] of
[00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:40.230] itself.
[00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:40.950] And
[00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:41.090] this
[00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:41.210] is
[00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.350] how
[00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:41.470] we
[00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.610] end
[00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:41.770] up
[00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:42.210] solving
[00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:43.190] Markov
[00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.430] decision
[00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.870] processes.
[00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:45.570] So
[00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:45.930] at
[00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:46.050] the
[00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:46.190] root
[00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.310] of
[00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:46.410] the
[00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:46.550] tree
[00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:46.790] now,
[00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.230] we've
[00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.370] got
[00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:47.530] the
[00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:47.730] value
[00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:48.010] function
[00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:48.170] for
[00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.310] a
[00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:48.510] particular
[00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:48.930] state.
[00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.850] It
[00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:49.950] tells
[00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:50.090] us
[00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:50.210] how
[00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.410] good
[00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:50.510] is
[00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.610] it
[00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:50.710] to
[00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.770] be
[00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:50.850] in
[00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:50.990] this
[00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.290] state.
[00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:51.570] And
[00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:51.650] the
[00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.730] way
[00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:51.870] we're
[00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.990] going
[00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.290] to
[00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:52.590] understand
[00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:52.850] that
[00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:52.950] is
[00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:53.070] by
[00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:53.290] doing
[00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:53.570] a
[00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:53.930] two
[00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:54.270]-step
[00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.770] look
[00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:54.970] ahead.
[00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:55.710] So
[00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.810] if
[00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:55.850] we
[00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:56.030] look
[00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:56.250] ahead,
[00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:56.390] we
[00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.490] can
[00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:57.010] consider
[00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:57.270] all
[00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.390] the
[00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.690] actions
[00:57:57.690 --> 00:57:57.850] we
[00:57:57.850 --> 00:57:58.030] might
[00:57:58.030 --> 00:57:58.250] take
[00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.630] next.
[00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:59.190] Go
[00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.530] left,
[00:57:59.650 --> 00:57:59.850] go
[00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:00.150] right.
[00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:00.770] We
[00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:01.150] consider
[00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.410] all
[00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:01.550] the
[00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:01.750] things
[00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.870] that
[00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:02.010] the
[00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:02.310] environment
[00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:02.610] might
[00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:02.770] do
[00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:02.910] to
[00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:03.130] us.
[00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.750] Might
[00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:04.030] blow
[00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:04.190] me
[00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.450] over,
[00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:04.630] it
[00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.850] might
[00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:05.170] keep
[00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:05.250] me
[00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:05.510] standing
[00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.830] up.
[00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:06.510] Might
[00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:06.770] blow
[00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:07.210] me
[00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:07.390] over,
[00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:07.530] it
[00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:07.590] might
[00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:07.750] keep
[00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.850] me
[00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:08.090] standing
[00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:08.410] up.
[00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:08.930] There
[00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:08.990] are
[00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.130] all
[00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:09.230] the
[00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.390] things
[00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:09.490] the
[00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:09.790] environment
[00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:10.030] might
[00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:10.310] do.
[00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:10.710] And
[00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.790] then
[00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.890] for
[00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:11.070] each
[00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:11.150] of
[00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.290] those
[00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:11.450] things
[00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:11.570] the
[00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:11.830] environment
[00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:12.050] might
[00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:12.190] do,
[00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:12.370] there's
[00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:12.690] some

[00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:13.430] state
[00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.550] that
[00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:13.670] we'll
[00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.830] end
[00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:13.990] up
[00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.190] in.
[00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:14.630] And
[00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.690] we
[00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:14.830] want
[00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:14.950] to
[00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:15.070] know,
[00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:15.190] well,
[00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.330] how
[00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:15.530] good
[00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:15.650] is
[00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:15.770] it
[00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.910] to
[00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:16.030] be
[00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:16.150] in

[00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:17.670] and
[00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.890] carry
[00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:18.030] on
[00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:18.150] with
[00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.270] my
[00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:18.450] usual
[00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:18.850] policy?
[00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:19.510] How
[00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.670] much
[00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.910] reward
[00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:20.030] will
[00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.150] I
[00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.290] get
[00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:20.410] if
[00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:20.490] I
[00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:20.670] carry
[00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:20.830] on
[00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:20.950] from
[00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:21.110] that
[00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:21.390] point?
[00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:22.850] Now,
[00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.950] if
[00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:23.050] we
[00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:23.370] average
[00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:23.590] these
[00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:23.810] things
[00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:23.990] all
[00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.350] together,
[00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:25.250] we're
[00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.510] basically
[00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.970] averaging
[00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:26.130] in
[00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:26.310] two
[00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:26.550] ways.
[00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:26.710] Now
[00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.910] we're
[00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:27.210] averaging
[00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:27.530] over
[00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.710] our
[00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:28.110] policy.
[00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:29.470] We're
[00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.790] weighting
[00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:29.950] each
[00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:30.030] of
[00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:30.330] these
[00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:30.810] arcs
[00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:31.070] by
[00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:31.350] the
[00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:31.710] probability
[00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:32.070] that
[00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:32.210] our
[00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.450] policy
[00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:32.630] will
[00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.950] select
[00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:33.510] left
[00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.670] or
[00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.930] right.
[00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:34.570] We're
[00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:34.830] averaging
[00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:35.110] each
[00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:35.210] of
[00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.450] these
[00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:35.670] arcs
[00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:37.210] by
[00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:37.590] the
[00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:38.190] transition
[00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:38.730] probabilities
[00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:39.050] that
[00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:39.150] will
[00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.310] end
[00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:39.450] up
[00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:39.650] getting
[00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:39.870] blown
[00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:40.010] in
[00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.150] one
[00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.430] direction
[00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.610] or
[00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:40.850] another.
[00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:41.610] We
[00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:41.930] average
[00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:42.070] it
[00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:42.230] all
[00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.530] together
[00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.990] and
[00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.110] that
[00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:43.290] gives
[00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:43.390] us
[00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:43.510] the
[00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.710] value
[00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:43.830] of
[00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:43.970] being
[00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:44.070] in
[00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:44.170] the
[00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:44.310] root
[00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:44.450] of
[00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.730] this
[00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:45.370] diagram
[00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:45.670] here.
[00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:46.030] Tells
[00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:46.090] us
[00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:46.210] how
[00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:46.390] good
[00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.510] is
[00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.590] it
[00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:46.670] to
[00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.750] be
[00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.810] in
[00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:46.870] a
[00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:47.090] particular
[00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:47.470] state.
[00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.870] So
[00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:49.010] this
[00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.110] is
[00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:49.210] the
[00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:49.450] Bellman
[00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:49.830] equation.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:52.260] You
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:52.360] can
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:52.480] do
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:52.780] exactly
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:52.980] the
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:53.160] same
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:53.380] thing
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:53.540] for
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:53.820] action
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:54.260] values.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:54.560] There's
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:54.640] a
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.020] recursive
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:55.620] relationship.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:56.120] You
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:56.220] can
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:56.360] look
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:56.440] at
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:56.580] this
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:56.880] offline.
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:57.060] I
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:57.160] don't
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:57.300] want
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:57.400] to
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:57.500] sort
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:57.600] of
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:57.860] belabor
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:58.020] the
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:58:58.280] point.
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:58:59.100] It's
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:58:59.280] just
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:58:59.640] stitching
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:58:59.800] the
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:00.080] diagram
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:00.540] together
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.100] the
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:01.240] other
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:01.400] way
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:01.760] around
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.260] and
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:02.360] we
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:02.500] end
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:02.620] up
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:02.720] with
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:02.980] exactly
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:03.160] the
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:03.340] same
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:03.700] idea.
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:04.780] Starting
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:05.180] from
[00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:05.300] a
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:05.560] particular
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:05.840] state
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:05.960] in
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:06.220] action,
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:06.740] we
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:06.840] can
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.000] now
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:07.180] look
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:07.400] ahead
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:07.620] two
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:08.020] steps.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:08.580] Consider
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:08.780] where
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:08.940] the
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:09.080] wind
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:09.320] might
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:09.560] blow
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:09.760] us
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.060] first
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:10.320] now
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.060] and
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:11.240] then
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:11.680] consider
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.320] from
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:12.460] the
[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:12.640] state
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:12.780] the
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:12.900] wind
[00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.080] might
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:13.240] blow
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:13.420] us
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:13.620] to,
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:14.820] which
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:15.120] action
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:15.320] might
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:15.460] I
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:15.640] take
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:15.880] next?
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:16.060] I
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:16.220] might
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:16.480] choose
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:16.600] to
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:16.700] go
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:16.920] left
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.040] or
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:17.120] I
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:17.240] might
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:17.420] choose
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:17.540] to
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:17.660] go
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:17.920] right.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:18.600] And
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:18.740] now
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:18.880] we
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:19.160] average
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:19.420] over
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:19.620] this
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:19.800] thing
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.120] again.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:20.840] We
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:21.020] look
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:21.160] at
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:21.680] the
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:21.900] value
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:22.000] of
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:22.120] that
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:22.400] particular

[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:23.100] the
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:23.240] Q
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:23.560] value,
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:24.460] average
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:24.660] these
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:24.900] things
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:25.040] all
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:25.340] together
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:25.600] and
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:25.720] it
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:25.900] tells
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.020] us
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:26.200] something
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:26.380] about
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:26.520] the
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:26.680] Q
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:26.880] value
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:27.000] of

[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:28.100] action
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:28.380] here.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:29.280] So
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:29.420] the
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:29.560] Q
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:29.820] value
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:30.260] relates
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:30.440] to
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:30.580] the
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:30.720] Q
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:31.180] values
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:31.540] at
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:31.640] the
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:31.840] next
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:32.100] step.
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:32.940] In
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:33.100] this
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:33.480] slide
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:33.800] and
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:33.920] the
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.200] previous
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:34.620] slide,
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:36.120] the
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:36.360] state
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:36.820] values
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:37.180] here
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:37.680] relate
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:37.800] to
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:37.920] the
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.100] state
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:38.400] values
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:38.520] at
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:38.620] the
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:38.800] next
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.020] step.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:39.780] So
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:39.880] you
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:39.980] get
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:40.140] these
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:40.360] two
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:40.820] recursive
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:41.380] relationships
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:42.260] explaining
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:42.480] how
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:42.620] the
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:42.820] value
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:43.240] function
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:43.860] relates
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:44.000] to
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.340] itself
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:44.500] at
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:44.600] the
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:44.760] next
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.000] step.
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:45.800] In
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:46.080] all
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:46.200] of
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:46.340] these
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:46.680] cases,
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:46.860] if
[00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:46.940] you
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.120] just
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:47.320] look
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:47.580] beneath
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:47.740] the
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:47.980] map,
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:48.300] the
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:48.560] math,
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:48.960] it's
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.020] a
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:49.160] very
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:49.400] simple
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:49.700] idea
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:49.920] which
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.100] says
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:50.260] the
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:50.480] value
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:50.880] function
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:51.780] at
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:51.920] the
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.140] current
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:52.360] time
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:52.660] step
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:52.860] is
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:53.060] equal
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:53.220] to
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:53.340] the
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:53.580] immediate
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:54.040] reward
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.240] plus
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:55.460] the
[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:55.660] value
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:55.980] function
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:56.120] of
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:56.420] where
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:56.520] you
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:56.660] end
[00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:56.860] up.
[00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:58.580] That's
[00:59:58.580 --> 00:59:58.720] all
[00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:58.900] these
[00:59:58.900 --> 00:59:59.060] things
[00:59:59.060 --> 00:59:59.200] are
[00:59:59.200 --> 00:59:59.440] saying
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.060] just
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:00.220] with
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:00.560] different
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.100] ways
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:01.200] of
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:01.380] putting
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:01.700] together
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:01.840] the
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.060] maths.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:04.660] OK,
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:05.340] so
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:05.540] let's
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:05.720] do
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:05.920] that
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.100] for
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:06.460] one
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.120] example
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:07.440] in
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:07.600] our
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:07.900] student
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:08.300] MDP
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:09.560] and
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:09.700] then
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:09.780] we'll
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:09.960] move
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.060] on
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:10.160] a
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.300] little
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:10.520] bit.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:13.600] So
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.080] here's
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:14.320] our
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:14.900] student
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.240] MDP
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:15.680] again.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:15.980] We're
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.040] going
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:16.120] to
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:16.380] consider
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:16.640] just
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:16.900] one
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:17.260] state,
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:17.540] this
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:17.780] red
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.080] state
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:18.400] here,
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:18.880] so
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.000] the
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:19.240] class
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:19.500] three
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:19.920] state.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:20.880] And
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.140] again,
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:21.600] I'm
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:21.720] just
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:21.840] going
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.300] to
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:22.860] verify
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:23.380] we're
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:23.520] not
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:23.660] kind
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:23.740] of
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:24.060] compute
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:24.300] using
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:24.500] this
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:24.760] Bellman
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.020] equation
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:25.340] to
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.120] compute
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:26.360] these
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:26.580] value
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:26.980] functions.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:27.440] We're
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:27.480] going
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:27.560] to
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:27.640] use
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:27.780] it
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:27.940] to
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:28.320] verify
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.280] that
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:29.660] this
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.120] indeed
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:30.400] does
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:30.600] have
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:30.720] the
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:30.960] value
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.140] of
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:31.340] 7
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:31.800].4.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:32.640] OK,
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:33.720] so
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:33.900] how
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:33.980] can
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:34.080] we
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:34.380] verify
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:34.600] it?
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:34.720] Well,
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:34.840] we
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:34.960] can
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.340] unroll,
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:35.500] we
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:35.600] can
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:35.760] do
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.040] our
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:36.500] look
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:36.780] ahead.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:37.940] And
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:38.040] what
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:38.180] we're
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:38.220] going
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:38.260] to
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:38.400] do
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:38.500] is
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:38.620] we're
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:38.660] going
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:38.700] to
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:38.840] do
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.080] our
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:39.440] look
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:39.680] ahead
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:39.880] for
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.020] the
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:40.240] state
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:40.480] value
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:40.820] function
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:41.160] here.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.120] So
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:42.240] we're
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:42.420] saying
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:42.540] the
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:42.720] state
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:42.940] value
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:43.340] function
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:43.820] 7
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:44.360].4
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.100] is
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:45.400] equal
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:45.820] to
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:46.940] all
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.080] the
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:47.320] things
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:47.540] which
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:47.820] we
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:48.240] might
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:48.440] do
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:48.660] from
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:48.920] there.
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:49.620] So
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:49.820] what
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:49.920] are
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:49.980] the
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:50.120] things
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:50.260] we
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:50.400] might
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:50.580] do
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:50.760] from
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:50.940] there?
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:51.260] Well,
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:52.380] we

[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:53.720] So
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:53.780] you
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:53.900] can
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:54.020] see
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:54.200] this
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:54.280] is
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:54.460] quite

[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:56.560] And
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:56.660] so
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:56.900] that's
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:57.020] this

[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:57.740] here.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.120] We
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:58.260] just
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:58.440] sum
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:58.620] those
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:58.840] things
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.280] together.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:00.100] So
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:00.260] we're
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:00.560] summing
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:00.840] together
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.040] this
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:01.260] look
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:01.500] ahead
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:01.640] of
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:01.780] what
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:01.960] might
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.240] happen
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:02.480] after
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:02.760] one
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.000] step
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:03.140] of
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:03.360] taking
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:03.740] actions
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:03.940] and
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.100] one
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:04.300] step
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:04.420] of
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:04.520] where
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:04.640] we
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:04.760] end
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.020] up.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.080] And
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:06.200] when
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:06.320] you
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:06.480] add
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:06.640] this
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.060] together,
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:07.880] so
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:07.980] in
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:08.140] one
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:08.380] decimal
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:08.720] place,
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:08.860] you
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.160] get
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.120] 7
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:10.560].4.
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:11.800] So
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:11.920] we've
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.060] sort
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:12.180] of
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:12.600] verified
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:12.900] that
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.060] these
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:13.420] numbers
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:14.120] are
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:14.360] self
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:14.820]-consistent
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:15.040] for
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.180] this
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:15.380] one
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:15.740] state.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:16.140] You
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:16.260] can
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:16.560] verify
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:16.780] them
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:16.900] for
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:17.020] all
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:17.080] of
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:17.160] the
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:17.320] other
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:17.620] states
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:17.760] and
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:17.880] you
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:17.980] would
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:18.280] discover
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:18.500] that
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:18.760] this
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.060] Bellman
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:19.380] equation
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:19.680] does
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:19.940] indeed
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:20.260] hold
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:20.800] and
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.100] therefore
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:21.360] these
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:21.640] numbers
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:21.840] do
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.220] represent
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:22.420] the
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:22.600] value
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:22.920] function
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.080] for
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:23.280] this
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:23.860] MDP.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.040] So
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.200] that
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:25.520] basically
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:25.800] tells
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:25.980] us
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.200] now
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:26.360] we
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:26.600] really
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:26.940] know
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:27.480] how
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:27.660] good
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:27.760] is
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:27.880] it
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.000] to
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.140] be
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:28.260] in
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:28.400] each
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:28.520] one
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:28.600] of
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:28.720] these
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.060] states.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:29.640] You
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:29.880] really
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.140] will
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:30.420] get
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:30.920] 7
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.360].4
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:31.620] units
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:31.760] of
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.040] reward
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:32.180] in
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:32.720] expectation
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.280] if
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:33.360] you
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:33.520] just
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:33.800] behave
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.060] according
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:34.220] to
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:34.360] this
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:34.740] policy.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.160] OK,
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:37.460] is
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:37.580] that
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:37.800] clear?
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.080] Right.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:41.600] So
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.000] that's
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:42.120] all
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:42.300] very
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:42.560] well.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:42.980] It
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.240] doesn't
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:43.440] tell
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:43.640] us
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:43.940] the
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:44.120] best
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:44.300] way
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:44.420] to
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:44.700] behave.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:45.540] And
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:45.640] what
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:45.760] we
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:45.960] really
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:46.180] care
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:46.440] about
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:46.580] in
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:46.860] MDP
[01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:47.100] is
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.300] figuring
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:47.480] out
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:47.620] the
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:47.800] best
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:47.940] way
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.080] to
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:48.340] behave.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:52.860] So
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:53.300] OK,
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:53.560] just
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:53.900] briefly
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:54.180] before
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:54.360] we
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:54.480] do
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:54.720] that.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:55.160] So
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:55.280] I
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:55.540] briefly
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:56.020] introduced
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:56.340] earlier
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:56.500] and
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:56.600] I
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:56.720] said
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:56.820] it
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.100] wasn't
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:57.600] essential,
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:58.380] but
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:58.520] you
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:58.640] could
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.100] this
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:02:59.320] idea
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:02:59.440] that
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:02:59.500] you
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:02:59.620] could
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:00.180] flatten
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:01.540] any
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:01.900] MDP
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:02.240] back
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:02.440] into
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:02.580] a
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:02.820] Markov
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:03.000] reward
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:03.420] process
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:03.940] by
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:04.280] defining
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:04.560] these
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.400] averaged
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.020] state
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:06.420] transition
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:06.860] dynamics
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:07.040] and
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:07.460] averaged
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:07.740] reward
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.380] function.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:09.840] And
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.280] of
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:10.420] course,
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:10.620] once
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:10.780] we've
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.080] averaged
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:11.280] those
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:11.660] things,
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:12.060] that
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:12.240] gives
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:12.480] us
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:12.680] a
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:12.920] Markov
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:13.120] reward
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:13.520] process.
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:13.940] We
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:14.100] know
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:14.240] how
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:14.380] to
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:14.580] solve
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:14.760] those
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:14.980] things
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:15.260] already.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:15.820] So
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:15.940] at
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:16.040] least
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:16.260] one
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:16.440] way
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:16.560] to
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:16.800] solve
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.040] that.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:17.340] Another
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:17.560] way
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:17.700] to
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:17.840] have
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.140] solved
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:18.740] for
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:18.940] these
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.360] numbers
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:19.920] would
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.020] have
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:20.160] been

[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.160] these
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:21.620] matrices,
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:23.020] form
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:23.160] the
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:23.440] matrix
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:23.600] of
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:23.720] our

[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:24.560] probabilities
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.020] for
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:25.180] all
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:25.280] of
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:25.360] our
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:25.720] actions,
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:26.360] average
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:26.580] them
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:26.960] together
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.180] to
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:27.320] get

[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:28.760] average

[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:29.240] our

[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:29.960] to

[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:31.460] solve

[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:33.620] would
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:33.740] have
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:33.960] spat
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.180] out
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:34.380] our
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:34.700] actual
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:35.120] value
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:35.480] function.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:36.540] So
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:36.660] that's
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:36.860] one
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:37.020] way
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:37.160] to
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:37.420] arrive
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:37.500] at
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:37.600] the
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:37.940] solutions,
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:38.260] and
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:38.380] we'll
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:38.560] look
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:38.640] at
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:38.780] more
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:39.060] efficient
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:39.280] ways
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:39.420] to
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:39.540] do
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:39.880] it
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.920] going
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.120] into
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:41.240] the
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:41.460] future.
[01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:45.330] But
[01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:45.530] you
[01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.730] should
[01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:45.870] at
[01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:46.010] least
[01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:46.470] understand
[01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.590] the
[01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:46.750] idea
[01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.890] that
[01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:47.010] the
[01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:47.230] Bellman
[01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.630] equation
[01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:48.330] gives
[01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:48.750] us
[01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:49.250] a
[01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.610] description
[01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:49.810] of
[01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:49.930] the
[01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:50.190] system
[01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.350] that
[01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:50.450] we
[01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.610] can
[01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:50.890] solve.
[01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:51.550] Once
[01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:51.690] we
[01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:51.910] solve
[01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:52.030] for
[01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:52.170] this
[01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:52.350] thing,
[01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:52.470] it
[01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.670] tells
[01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.890] us
[01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:53.270] exactly
[01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.410] what
[01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:53.530] the
[01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:53.690] value
[01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.970] function
[01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:54.230] is.
[01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.810] So
[01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:55.030] one
[01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:55.270] linear
[01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.570] equation,
[01:03:55.630 --> 01:03:55.730] we
[01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.950] solve
[01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:56.070] it,
[01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:56.230] you've
[01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.330] got
[01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:56.450] the
[01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:56.630] value
[01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.930] function.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:01.660] Right
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.020] now,
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:04.180] for
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:04.320] the
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:04.700] last
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:05.760] half
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:05.920] an
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:06.080] hour,
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:06.560] I
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:06.740] want
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:06.820] to
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:06.980] talk
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:07.300] about,
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:07.940] you
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:08.000] know,
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:08.100] the
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:08.360] essential
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:08.600] problem
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:08.760] we
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:08.940] really
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:09.140] care
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:09.360] about,
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:09.560] which
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:09.800] is
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.340] finding
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:10.520] the
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:10.700] best
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:11.080] behavior
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:11.240] in
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:11.320] the
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:11.600] MDP.
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:12.500] I'll
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:12.620] just
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:12.880] pause
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.000] for
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:13.080] a
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:13.280] moment.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:13.520] Just
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.300] sorry,
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:14.420] I
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:14.480] know
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:14.600] there's
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:14.680] a
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:14.780] lot
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:14.860] of
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:15.140] material.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:15.420] So
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.280] any
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:16.720] questions
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.040] at
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:18.140] this
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:18.440] point?
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:19.980] People
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.320] checking?
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:20.340] Slides
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:20.640] online
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:20.820] are
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.120] slightly
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:21.580] different,
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.000] just
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.420] minor
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:22.820] changes
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:23.020] to
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:23.240] these.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:23.900] Are
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.040] you
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:24.200] going
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:24.300] to
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:24.480] put
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:24.720] the
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:24.940] newest
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:25.160] ones
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:25.440] online?
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:25.640] I'll
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:25.740] put
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:25.840] the
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:25.980] newest
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.180] ones
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:26.480] online
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:26.860] immediately
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:27.320] afterwards.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:27.520] Yeah,
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:27.800] so
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.020] it's
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:28.300] mostly
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:28.700] notation
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.060] change.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:29.200] I
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:29.980] changed
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:30.120] the
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:30.420] notation
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:30.640] to
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:30.860] match
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:31.100] the
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:31.400] new
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:31.600] edition
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:31.740] of
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:31.920] Saturn
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.060] and
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:32.320] Barter.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:33.200] Can
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:33.220] you
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:33.320] just
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:33.640] explain
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:33.880] again
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.000] what
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:34.260] happened
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:34.380] to
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:34.540] the
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:34.820] state
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.140] pub,
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:35.440] which
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:35.720] seems
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:35.820] to
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:35.940] have
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.120] turned
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:36.360] into
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:36.600] some
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:36.880] other,
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:39.140] it
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:39.300] used
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:39.340] to
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:39.480] be
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:39.640] a
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:39.880] state,
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:40.260] right?
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:40.560] Yeah,
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:40.760] so
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:40.920] when
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.040] we
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:41.500] moved
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:41.780] from
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:42.360] the
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:42.680] Markov
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:42.920] reward
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.280] process
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:43.480] to
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:43.580] the
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:43.800] Markov
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.040] decision
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:44.440] process,
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:44.660] we
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:45.040] changed
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:45.220] the
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:45.520] definition
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:45.700] of
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:45.780] the
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:46.020] problem.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:46.920] So
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.120] pub
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:47.320] used
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:47.400] to
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:47.500] be
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:47.620] a
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:47.800] state.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.120] Now
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:48.340] it's
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:48.500] a
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:48.800] decision
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:48.920] that
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.080] we're
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:49.320] making.
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:49.540] We're
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:49.720] taking
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:49.860] a
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:50.140] decision
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:50.460] now.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:51.340] So
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:51.840] we're
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.020] making
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:52.220] these
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:52.600] decisions
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:52.880] of
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.040] whether
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:53.220] to
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:53.340] go
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:53.500] to
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:53.680] the
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:53.840] pub
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:54.720] or
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:54.940] whether
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:55.140] to
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:55.500] study.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:56.420] So
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:56.640] it's
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:56.860] actually
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:56.980] a
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:57.180] different
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:57.560] problem
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:57.740] that
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:58.180] we're
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:58.520] studying
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:58.780] now.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:04:59.240] So
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:04:59.520] pub
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:04:59.620] is
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:04:59.740] an
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.060] action?
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:00.600] Yeah,
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:00.780] pub
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:00.900] is
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.020] an
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:01.220] action.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:01.540] It
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:01.780] ends
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:01.920] up
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.040] with
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:02.320] something
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:02.560] which
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:02.760] isn't
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:02.920] a
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.100] state,
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:03.320] whereas
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:03.640] study
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:03.880] ends
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.060] up
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:04.180] in
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:04.440] something
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:04.680] which
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:04.780] is
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:04.960] a
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.180] state.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:05.400] So
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:05.560] what?
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:05.840] No,
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:06.140] everything
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:06.380] ends
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:06.520] up
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:06.620] in
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:06.720] a
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:06.920] state.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:07.360] So
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:07.660] if
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:07.800] you
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.240] take
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:08.380] the
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:08.540] pub
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:08.880] action,
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:09.660] you
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:09.820] end
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:09.960] up
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.060] at
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:10.240] this,
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:10.520] this
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:10.860] black
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:11.060] dot
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:11.460] represents
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:11.680] like
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:11.800] a
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.240] chance
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.000] mode.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:13.240] You
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:13.780] can't
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:14.040] stay
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:14.280] there.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:14.480] You
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:14.700] can't
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:14.880] stay
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.060] there.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:15.200] No,
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:15.480] the
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:15.740] action
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.000] takes
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:16.120] you
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:16.200] to
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:16.380] here
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:16.500] and
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:16.580] you
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:16.980] immediately,
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:17.340] the
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:17.700] environment
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.180] immediately
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:18.560] transitions
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:18.900] you
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.060] to
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:19.280] here,
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:19.740] to
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:19.940] here
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:20.100] or
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:20.260] to
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:20.460] here
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:20.660] with
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:20.840] these
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:21.320] probabilities.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:22.360] So
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:22.760] you
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:22.860] can
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:23.040] think
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.160] of
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:23.360] this
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:23.480] as
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:23.760] basically
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:24.020] telling
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:24.160] you
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:24.280] the
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:24.740] dynamics.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:25.740] So
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:25.860] if
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:25.920] you
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.160] take,
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.240] if
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:27.340] you
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:27.520] take
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:27.680] this
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:27.880] pub
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.200] action,
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:28.660] you're
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:28.900] basically
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:29.080] going
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:29.160] to
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:29.300] be
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:29.920] teleported
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.080] to
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:30.300] here,
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:30.540] here
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:30.720] or
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:30.980] here.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:31.540] You'll
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:31.660] get
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:31.760] a
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.080] plus
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:32.260] one
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:32.520] reward
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:32.700] along
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:32.800] the
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.040] way.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:33.420] And
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:33.500] the
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:33.900] probability
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:34.040] of
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:34.180] ending
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:34.320] up
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:34.480] here,
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:34.660] here
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:34.800] or
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:34.960] here
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.140] is
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:35.560] given
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:35.700] by
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:35.880] these
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.180] numbers.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:36.920] That's
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.020] what
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:37.120] it
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:37.320] means.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:37.620] OK,
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:38.660] why
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:38.960] did
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.080] you
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:39.240] do
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:39.480] that?
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:40.040] I
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:40.180] don't
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:40.580] understand.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.080] Why
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:41.360] did
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:41.480] you
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:41.640] now
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:41.860] have
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:42.040] this
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:42.380] separate
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:42.660] sort
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:43.420] of
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:43.860] transient
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.360] state?
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:45.960] Because
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.140] I
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:46.340] wanted
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:46.580] to
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:46.920] illustrate
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:47.180] an
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:47.460] example
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:47.660] where
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:47.760] you
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:47.920] have
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.080] some
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:48.460] agency,
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:48.660] where
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:48.700] you
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:48.840] have
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:48.980] some
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:49.360] control
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:49.680] over
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:49.880] what
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:50.260] happens
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:50.600] in
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:50.700] the
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.020] environment.
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.040] And
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:53.420] now
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:53.720] it's
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:53.820] a
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:54.080] choice
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:54.280] whether
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:54.420] to
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:54.540] go
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:54.640] to
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:54.760] the
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:54.880] pub
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:55.000] or
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:55.220] not.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:55.680] And
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:55.800] the
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.260] randomness
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:56.400] is
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:56.700] now
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:57.220] what
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:57.520] happens
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:57.740] after
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:57.840] you
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:57.940] go
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.040] to
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:58.160] the
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:58.280] pub.
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:58.740] So
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:05:58.920] all
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.020] the
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:05:59.220] other
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:05:59.440] states
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:05:59.620] could
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:05:59.780] be
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:00.180] considered
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:00.520] to
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:00.640] be
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:00.780] the
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:00.980] same
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.120] as
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:01.280] that,
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:01.460] but
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:01.700] with
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:02.180] just
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:02.700] probability
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:03.000] and
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:03.280] one
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.600] of
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:04.880] going
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.120] to
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:05.240] there.
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:05.540] Exactly.
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:06.160] Everything,
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:06.660] you
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:06.780] can
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.200] implicitly
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:07.500] imagine
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:07.720] there's
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:07.860] one
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:07.960] of
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:08.100] these
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:08.340] black
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:08.740] dots
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.260] in
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:09.540] every
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:09.660] one
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:09.760] of
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:09.880] these
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.100] other
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:10.360] arcs.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:10.460] So
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:10.560] if
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:10.620] you
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:10.740] go
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:10.860] to
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:11.200] Facebook,
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:11.520] there's
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:11.600] a
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:11.800] black
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.040] dot
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:12.320] here
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:12.900] that
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:13.140] says
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:13.480] the
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:13.720] action
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:13.840] is
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.020] taking
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:14.140] you
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:14.180] to
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:14.320] that
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:14.540] black
[01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:14.920] dot,
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:15.300] but
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:15.460] that
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:15.660] black
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:15.860] dot
[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:16.000] is
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.320] always
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:16.600] taking
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:16.720] you
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:16.860] here
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.000] with
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:17.300] probability
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:17.580] one.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:19.300] And
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.140] they
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:21.320] say
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:21.580] that
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.400] actions
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:22.860] also
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.180] have
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:23.740] rewards.
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:24.480] Earlier
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:24.880] on,
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.000] they
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:25.120] were
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:25.460] saying
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:25.820] only
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:26.080] that
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:26.240] the
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:26.560] state
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:26.820] has
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:27.300] rewards.
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.140] And
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:28.420] now
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:28.740] that's
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:28.860] an
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.120] action.
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:29.560] Yeah,
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:29.720] if
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:29.780] we
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:29.920] go
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.120] back
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:30.260] to
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:30.280] the
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:30.440] definition,
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:30.600] this
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:30.700] was
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:30.840] all
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:30.940] in
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:31.000] the
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:31.340] definition
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:31.460] of
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:31.720] MDP.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:33.880] So
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:33.960] if
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.040] we
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:34.140] go
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:34.280] back
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:34.380] to
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:34.480] the
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:34.760] definition
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:34.940] of
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:35.320] MDP,
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:36.100] the
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:36.420] red
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:37.940] highlights
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:38.240] here
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:38.560] indicate
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:38.820] what
[01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:39.240] changed
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:39.440] from
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:39.560] the
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:39.800] Markov
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.020] reward
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:40.460] process.
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:41.180] And
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:41.300] one
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:41.400] of
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:41.460] the
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:41.600] things
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:41.740] which
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:42.040] changed
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:42.220] was
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:42.340] that
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:42.460] the
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:42.800] reward
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.260] function
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:44.140] was
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:44.340] now
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:44.820] indexed
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:44.940] by
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:45.200] both
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:45.520] state
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:45.820] and
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:46.140] action.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:46.860] So
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:47.000] the
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:47.480] reward
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:47.700] does
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.000] depend
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:48.200] on
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:48.480] the
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:48.680] action
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:48.820] you
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:49.060] take.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.180] That's
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:50.260] the
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:50.560] definition
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:50.740] of
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.020] MDP.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.320] OK,
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:53.980] so
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:54.560] what
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:54.680] you
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:54.840] do
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.080] might
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:55.400] affect
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:55.540] the
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:55.760] immediate
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.020] reward
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:56.160] you
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:56.360] get,
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:56.520] as
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:56.660] well
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:56.800] as
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:56.920] the
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.060] state
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:57.180] you
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:57.320] end
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:57.460] up
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:57.620] in.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:58.220] So
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:58.800] sometimes
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.400] there's
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:06:59.480] a
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:06:59.700] cost
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:06:59.800] to
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:06:59.900] the
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.100] action
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:00.240] you
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:00.400] take.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:00.600] That's
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:00.700] the
[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:00.900] simplest
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.240] case.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:01.500] Like
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:02.340] imagine
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:02.480] a
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:02.740] trading
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:03.000] agent.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:03.220] You
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:03.780] buy
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.000] a
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:05.260] thousand
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:05.540] pounds
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:05.720] of
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:05.940] goods
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:06.340] from
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.060] someone
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:07.600] that
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.120] immediately
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:08.540] costs
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:08.800] you
[01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.080] a
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:09.300] thousand
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:09.680] pounds
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:09.960] compared
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.120] to
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:10.240] the
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:10.480] action
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:10.620] of
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:10.740] do
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:11.040] nothing,
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:11.680] which
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:11.900] costs
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:12.060] you
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:12.240] zero.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:12.800] So
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:12.940] there's
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:13.040] a
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:13.260] cost
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:13.740] associated
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:14.020] with
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:14.160] the
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:14.460] specific
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:14.880] actions
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.660] and
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:15.820] they
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.020] take
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:16.140] you
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:16.260] to
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:16.500] different
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:16.880] states.
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:17.860] So
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.180] that's
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:18.480] really
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:18.660] the
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:18.980] commonest
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:19.260] case.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.040] So
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:21.120] you
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:21.280] should
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:21.800] intuitively
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.420] expect
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:22.680] that
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.080] rewards
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:23.380] have
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.220] different
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:25.260] effects
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:25.520] depending
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:25.640] on
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:25.720] the
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.100] particular
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:26.380] action
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:26.540] you
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:26.780] take.
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:27.400] But
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:27.520] it's
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:27.560] a
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:27.700] form
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:27.820] of

[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:31.660] possibly
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.100] taking
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:32.260] an
[01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:32.460] action
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:32.660] but
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:32.980] ending
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.220] up
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:33.980] probabilistically
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.260] in
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:34.420] one
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:34.540] of
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:34.620] a
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:34.840] number
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.000] of
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:35.320] different
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:35.600] states.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:35.920] An
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:36.240] MDP
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:36.460] is
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.000] stochastic.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:37.240] An
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:37.480] MDP
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:37.660] is
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.160] stochastic.
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:38.860] The
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:39.260] stochastic
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:39.880] transitions
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:40.800] depend
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:40.980] on
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:41.080] the
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:41.300] action
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:41.420] that
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:41.500] you
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:41.740] take.
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:42.020] So
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:42.140] you
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:42.260] get
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:42.380] to
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:42.540] take
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:42.660] an
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:42.880] action.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:43.360] The
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:43.720] environment
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.400] gets
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:44.600] to
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:44.860] throw
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:45.060] the
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:45.300] dice
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:45.460] and
[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:45.620] tell
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:45.700] you
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:45.820] where
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:45.940] you
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:46.080] end
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:46.280] up.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:47.380] So
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:47.620] it's
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:47.720] a
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:47.960] combination
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:48.300] of
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:48.520] your
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:48.940] actions
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.320] and
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:49.480] the
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:49.720] dice
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:49.880] which
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.040] get
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:50.200] rolled
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:50.340] by
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:50.440] the
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:50.760] environment
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.000] which
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:51.320] determine
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:51.520] what
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:51.800] happens
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.140] next.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:53.540] Okay,
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:53.800] good.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.200] Okay.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:06.960] So
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.440] now
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:07.640] let's
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:07.820] talk
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:08.200] about
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:09.080] how
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:09.220] to
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:09.440] find
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:09.600] the
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:09.820] best
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:10.220] possible
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:10.700] solution
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:10.860] to
[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:10.940] the
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:11.200] MDP.
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:12.300] So
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:12.380] what
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:12.500] we
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:12.700] really
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:13.040] want,
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:13.480] we
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:13.640] don't
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:13.920] really
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:14.180] care
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:14.520] about
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:14.880] how
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.060] much
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:15.320] reward
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:15.460] we'll
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:15.640] get
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:15.940] following
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:16.180] this
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:16.640] crazy

[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:17.700] policy
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:17.940] in
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:18.820] the

[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:20.620] Markov
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:20.880] chain.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:21.420] What
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:21.540] we
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:21.680] care
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:21.860] about
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:21.980] is
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:22.180] finding
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:22.340] the
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:22.560] best

[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:23.240] the
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:23.540] system.
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:23.940] In
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:24.160] general,
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:24.320] you
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:24.460] want
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:24.560] to
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:24.740] find
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:24.860] the
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.180] optimal
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:26.560] way
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:26.760] to
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.020] solve
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:27.180] your
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:27.480] problem.
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:28.580] And
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:28.700] so
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:28.900] let's
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:29.220] define
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:29.360] what
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:29.500] that
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:29.660] really
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:29.920] means
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.200] now.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:30.640] And
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:30.700] so
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:30.880] we're
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:30.880] going
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:30.920] to
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.140] start
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:31.280] with

[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.000] functions.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:32.600] We're
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:32.820] basically
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:33.000] going
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:33.120] to
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:33.420] say
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.200] this

[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:37.240] V
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:37.520] star,
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:38.200] is
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:38.400] the

[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:40.680] policies.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.020] Okay.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.080] So
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:43.220] what
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:43.340] we're
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:43.580] saying
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:43.760] is
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.020] there's

[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:45.520] we

[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:47.080] And
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:47.180] what
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:47.300] we
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:47.440] care

[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.080] We
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:49.260] care

[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:54.160] If
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:54.260] you,
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:54.520] there's

[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.040] That's

[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.020] the
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:08.180] best
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:08.500] policy
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:08.780] was,

[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:09.560] what's
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:09.680] the

[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:15.880] victory.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:16.640] You've
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:16.820] got
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:16.980] the
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.340] quantities
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:17.840] necessary
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.060] to
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:18.280] behave
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:18.640] optimally
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:18.860] within
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:19.000] your
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:19.280] MDP.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.040] So
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:22.440] we
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:22.640] could
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:22.800] say
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.000] it
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:24.020] informally
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:24.140] that
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:24.280] an
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:24.500] MDP
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:24.740] is
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.100] solved
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:25.740] when
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:25.860] we
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:26.120] know
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:26.500] this
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:26.840] optimal
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.080] value
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:27.420] function.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.060] So
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:28.760] solving
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:28.900] an
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.180] MDP,
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:29.660] you
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:29.780] could
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:29.960] think
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.080] of
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:30.200] as
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:30.600] finding
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.360] Q
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:31.620] star.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:34.480] So
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:34.680] let's
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:34.840] just
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:35.040] look
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:35.140] at
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:35.380] that.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:35.800] What
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:35.980] is
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:36.100] the
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:36.320] optimal
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:36.600] value
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:36.920] function
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.220] here?
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:37.440] So
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:37.640] again,
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:37.820] we're
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:37.840] going
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:37.880] to
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.000] look
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:38.100] at
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.220] the
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:38.880] undiscounted
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:39.120] case,
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:39.320] just
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:39.440] to
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:39.560] keep
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:39.680] the
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:39.840] number
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.280] simple.
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:41.580] And
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:41.680] in
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:41.820] this
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.000] case,
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:42.100] it
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:42.220] should
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:42.360] be
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:42.580] fairly
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:42.960] intuitive.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:43.200] You
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:43.320] can
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:43.500] kind
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:43.640] of
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:43.980] even
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:44.220] work
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:44.400] this
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:44.620] out,
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:44.760] you
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:44.860] know,
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:45.000] just
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:45.180] by
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:45.720] eyeballing
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:45.920] it.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:46.360] But
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:46.520] if
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:46.720] you're
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:46.940] in
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:47.420] this
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:47.680] state
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.060] here,
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:49.060] should
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:49.160] you
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:49.300] go
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:49.420] to
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:49.560] the
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:49.900] pub?
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:50.640] Should
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:50.780] you
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:51.160] study?
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:51.560] Well,
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:51.680] if
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:51.760] you
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.000] study,
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:52.160] you're
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:52.260] going
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:52.320] to
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:52.460] get
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:52.620] this
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:52.880] plus
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.240] 10
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.020] big
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:54.240] juicy
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:54.580] reward
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:54.700] and
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:54.800] go
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:54.940] to
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:55.200] sleep.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:55.680] So
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:55.820] that
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:56.080] turns
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:56.220] out
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:56.300] to
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:56.380] be
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:56.460] the
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:56.680] optimal
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:56.960] value.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:57.160] We'll
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:57.380] see
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:57.740] more
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:57.980] formally
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.180] how
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:58.320] to
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:58.560] derive
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:58.720] that
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:58.840] in
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:10:58.920] a
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.100] minute.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:00.360] If
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:00.440] we
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:00.600] go
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:00.880] back
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.380] up
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:01.660] one
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:01.920] state
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.160] here,
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:02.320] we
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:02.420] can
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:02.580] either
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:02.740] go
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:02.880] to
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.140] sleep
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:03.320] and
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:03.460] get
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:03.520] a
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:03.740] reward
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:03.860] of
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:04.120] zero
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.040] along
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:05.180] the
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:05.400] way,
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:05.700] or
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:05.840] we
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:05.940] can
[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:06.240] study
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:06.380] and
[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:06.520] end
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:06.660] up
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:06.760] in
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:06.900] this
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:07.100] nice
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:07.320] juicy
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:07.680] state
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:07.860] with
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:07.980] a

[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:09.840] and
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.140] get
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:10.440] minus
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:10.660] two
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:10.900] along
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:11.040] the
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:11.240] way.
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:11.880] So
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.080] the
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:12.280] value
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:12.400] of

[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:14.780] We

[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:15.160] up
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:15.360] one
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:15.580] state
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:15.880] again,
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.080] we
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:16.200] can
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:16.340] see
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:16.480] the

[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:16.800] of

[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:17.400] state
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:17.600] is
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.240] six,
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:18.540] because
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.140] after
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:19.280] a
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:19.460] reward
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:19.560] of
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:19.760] minus
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.100] two,
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:20.540] we'll
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:20.660] end
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:20.800] up
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:20.900] in
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.060] this

[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:21.440] with
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.360] eight.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:23.420] So
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:23.640] that's
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:23.780] the

[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:24.680] you
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:24.800] can
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.060] actually
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:25.300] get.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:25.480] This

[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:27.820] It
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:27.960] tells
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:28.120] you
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:28.280] how
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:28.480] good
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:28.580] it
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:28.720] is
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:28.800] to
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:28.920] be
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.020] in
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:29.220] each
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:29.320] of
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:29.480] these
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:29.860] states.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:31.800] And
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.200] that
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:32.420] tells
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:32.520] you
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:32.660] the
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:32.880] most
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.300] possible
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:33.620] juice
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:33.740] you
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:33.860] can
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:34.240] extract
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:34.440] from
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:34.620] this
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:34.920] MDP.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:35.720] It
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:35.980] doesn't
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:36.160] yet
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:36.320] tell
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:36.420] you
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:36.560] how
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:36.700] to
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:36.980] behave
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:37.120] in
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:37.300] it.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:37.860] To
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.020] do
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:38.380] that,
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:39.380] there's
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:39.540] two
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:39.740] things
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:39.860] you
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:39.960] can
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:40.220] do.
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:41.860] Well,
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:42.640] what
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:42.960] we
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.120] do
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:43.260] is
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:43.380] we
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:43.780] basically
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.200] define
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:44.380] our
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:44.520] Q
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:44.840] stars
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.120] now.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:45.740] In
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:45.860] order
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.060] to
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:46.260] figure
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:46.540] out
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:46.980] what's
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.100] the
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:47.280] best
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:47.580] action
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:47.740] to
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:47.960] take,
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:48.480] we
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:48.640] look
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:48.760] at
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:48.920] our
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.160] action
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:49.420] value
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:49.800] function.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.380] So
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:50.480] the
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:50.700] action
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:50.920] value
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:51.200] function
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:51.360] is
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:51.540] now
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:51.900] labeling
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:52.140] these
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:52.660] arcs
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:52.820] with
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:53.020] what's
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:53.120] the
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:53.320] value
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:53.440] of
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:53.600] each
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:53.880] arc.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:54.620] So
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:54.700] it's
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:54.820] saying,
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:54.960] what's
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:55.060] the
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:55.420] optimal
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:55.720] value
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:55.840] of
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:56.020] each
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:56.260] arc?
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:56.960] So
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:57.100] we
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:57.320] know,
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:57.660] for
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:57.860] example,
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.020] the
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:58.240] optimal
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:58.480] value
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:58.600] of
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:58.760] this
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:58.980] arc
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.300] here,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.360] that's
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:00.600] 10.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.160] You're
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:01.280] just
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:01.400] going
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:01.460] to
[01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:01.660] take
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:01.860] this,
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:02.060] you're
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:02.080] going
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:02.120] to
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:02.240] get
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:02.340] the
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:02.500] plus
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:02.660] 10
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:02.920] reward,
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:03.060] you'll
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:03.160] be
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:03.420] done.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:03.940] So
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:04.160] that's
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:04.260] the
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:04.460] value
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:04.560] of
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:04.720] this
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:04.900] arc
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:05.200] here.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:06.200] The
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:06.360] value
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:06.440] of
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:06.600] this
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:06.800] arc
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.160] here,
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:08.480] you
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:08.560] know,
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:08.660] we
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:08.840] know
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:09.020] that
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:09.220] you're
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:09.280] going
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:09.440] to
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:09.940] basically
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:10.680] get
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.040] minus
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:11.720] two
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:12.180] for
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:12.400] taking
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:12.620] that
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:12.900] arc
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.320] and
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:13.520] you're
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:13.560] going
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:13.640] to
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:13.800] end
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:13.940] up
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:14.040] in
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:14.140] a
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:14.340] state
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:14.640] that's
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:14.740] going
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:14.800] to
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:14.940] get
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:15.060] you
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:15.280] 10
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:15.820] units
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:15.960] of
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:16.240] reward.
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:16.840] So
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.020] the
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:17.360] value
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:17.460] of
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:17.620] this
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:17.860] arc
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:18.020] is
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:18.340] eight.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:18.860] The
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:19.060] value
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:19.180] of
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:19.320] this
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:19.560] arc
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:19.720] is
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.000] zero.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:21.720] So
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:21.900] now
[01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:22.020] we
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:22.200] can
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:22.500] actually
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:22.640] be
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:22.780] able
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:22.900] to
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:23.040] make
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:23.420] decisions.
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:23.620] We
[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:23.760] can
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.120] choose
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:24.600] what's
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:24.660] the
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:24.900] optimal
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.260] decision
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:25.440] to
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:25.580] take
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:25.740] from
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:26.000] here.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:26.440] Well,
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:26.720] clearly
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:26.900] you'd
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:27.080] pick
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:27.340] eight
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:27.560] above
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:27.820] zero.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.040] So
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:28.120] you
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:28.380] choose
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:28.500] to
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:28.660] take
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:28.820] this
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.020] arc
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:29.220] over
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:29.460] here.
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:32.500] Similarly,
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:32.860] over
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:33.240] here,
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:33.360] we
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:33.520] didn't
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:33.740] talk
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:33.940] about
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:34.080] the
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:34.300] arc
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:34.440] that
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:34.640] goes
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:34.800] down
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:34.900] to
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:35.020] the
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:35.300] pub
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:36.840] and
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.200] the
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:37.400] value
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:37.500] of
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:37.660] this
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:37.920] arc,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:38.040] and
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:38.140] we'll
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:38.260] see
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:38.420] how
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:38.540] to
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:38.760] compute
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:38.940] this
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:39.020] in
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:39.120] a
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:39.360] minute,
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:40.140] is
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:40.380] actually
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:40.620] 8
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.180].4.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:41.940] But
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:42.140] once
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:42.280] you've
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:42.440] got
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:42.620] this
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:42.960] value,
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:43.880] you
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:44.000] can
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:44.300] say,
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:44.620] so
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:44.780] this
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:44.980] arc
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:45.100] is
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:45.360] basically
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:45.880] averaging
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.140] over
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:46.280] all
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:46.400] the
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:46.560] things
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:46.720] which
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:46.880] might
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.140] happen
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:47.480] next
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:47.940] and
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:48.120] looking
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:48.220] at
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:48.300] the
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:48.520] value
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:48.660] of
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:48.960] six,
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:49.340] eight
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:49.480] and
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:49.720] 10
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:49.980] and
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:50.580] weighing
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:50.860] them.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:52.120] And
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:52.220] so
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:52.360] now
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:52.480] you
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:52.580] can
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:52.800] choose
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.120] between,
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:53.320] well,
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:53.460] should
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:53.580] I
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:53.700] go
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:53.820] into
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:53.960] a
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.140] state
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:54.280] that
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:54.440] gives
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:54.600] me
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.240] a
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.040] reward
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:56.540] of
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.460] 10
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:57.800] units
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:58.020] going
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:58.320] onwards?
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:12:58.740] Or
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:58.840] should
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:58.940] I
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:12:59.060] go
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:12:59.160] to
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:12:59.300] the
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:12:59.540] pub
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:12:59.900] where
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:12:59.960] I
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:00.080] get
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:00.200] this
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:00.400] nice
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:00.620] plus
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:00.820] one
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:01.100] reward
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:01.440] now
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:01.840] and
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.000] then
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:02.260] still
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:02.400] have
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:02.500] a
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:02.700] chance
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:02.780] to
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:02.880] get
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.000] my
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.280] 10?
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.000] Well,
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:04.100] you
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:04.240] have
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:04.340] to
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:04.500] weigh
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:04.640] them
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:04.840] up
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.000] and
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:05.380] it
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:05.540] depends
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:05.620] on
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:05.700] the
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:05.960] discount
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.240] factor
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:06.360] and
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:06.460] all
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:06.560] these
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:06.720] other
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.020] things.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:07.640] In
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:07.820] this
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:08.040] case,
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:08.180] we
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:08.340] see
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:08.500] that
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:08.720] this
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:08.940] arc
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:09.100] has
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:09.180] a
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:09.340] value
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:09.460] of
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:09.700] 10.
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:10.280] This
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:10.460] arc
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:10.660] has
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:10.900] a
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:11.200] value
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:11.300] of
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:11.440] 8
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:11.840].4.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:12.060] So
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:12.400] fortunately,
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:12.560] it
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:12.740] turns
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:12.880] out
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.000] I'm
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:13.140] not
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:13.540] recommending
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:13.700] that
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:13.780] you
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:13.900] all
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:14.020] go
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:14.140] and
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:14.340] drink
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:14.580] beer
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:14.920] and
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.720] you
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:16.940] stay
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:17.080] and
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:17.400] listen
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:17.520] to
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:17.620] the
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:17.820] cops.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.080] Yeah,
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:18.360] question.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:18.780] There
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:18.900] was
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:18.980] a
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:19.160] question
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:19.420] earlier
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:19.760] about
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:20.680] what
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.500] happens
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:22.760] then
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:22.940] if
[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:23.040] you
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:23.220] have
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:23.500] a
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.180] positive
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:24.680] cycle?
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:28.100] So
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:28.620] I
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:30.060] was
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:30.200] talking
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:30.360] about
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:30.440] a
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:30.740] Markov
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.560] chain
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:31.720] at
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:31.860] that
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.180] point.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:32.800] OK,
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:33.440] so
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.000] yeah.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:37.400] So
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:37.760] if
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:38.000] you've
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:38.220] got,
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.020] there
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:39.140] are
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:39.720] technical
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.380] conditions
[01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:40.960] under
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:41.340] which
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.680] reasonably
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.240] defined
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:43.640] Markov
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:43.900] decision
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:44.340] processes
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:44.540] are
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:45.040] guaranteed
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:45.520] to
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.060] terminate.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:46.720] So
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:46.840] if
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:46.920] you
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.060] want
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:47.140] to
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:47.280] find
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:47.380] out
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:47.500] more
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:47.680] about
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:47.800] that,
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:47.940] there's
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:48.020] a
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:48.220] great
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:48.520] book
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:49.360] by
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.020] Bert
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:50.440] Cekas.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:50.840] He
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.020] goes
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:51.160] into
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:51.360] all
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:51.480] the
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:51.740] technical
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:52.220] conditions
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:52.500] under
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:52.720] which
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:53.040] Markov
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:53.280] decision
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:53.660] processes
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:53.860] are
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:54.020] well
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:54.380] defined.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:55.580] What
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:55.780] we're
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:55.900] going
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:56.000] to
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:56.160] talk
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:56.320] about
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:56.440] is
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:56.760] largely
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:56.940] the
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:57.440] discounted
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:57.740] case
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:58.020] because
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:58.180] it's
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:58.440] simpler.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:58.940] In
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.040] the
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:13:59.480] discounted
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:13:59.760] case,
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:00.240] you
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:00.400] don't
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:00.500] need
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:00.600] to
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:00.740] worry
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:00.920] about
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.100] any
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:01.200] of
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:01.340] that
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:01.580] stuff.
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:02.180] So
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:02.280] if
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:02.360] you
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:02.540] do
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:02.740] want
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:02.980] to
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:03.220] kind
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:03.280] of
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:03.520] remove
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:03.840] discount
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.320] factors
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:06.860] and
[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:07.260] consider
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:07.420] the
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:07.620] case
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:07.720] where
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:07.800] you
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:07.940] don't
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:08.080] have
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:08.540] discounting
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:08.660] at
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:08.900] all,
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:09.740] then
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:09.900] you
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:10.040] need
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:10.160] to
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:10.420] consider
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:10.600] what
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:10.860] happens
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:10.980] if
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:11.040] you
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:11.160] have
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:11.380] infinite
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:11.820] cycles
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:12.100] and
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:12.240] so
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:12.580] forth.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:12.820] And
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:13.920] there's
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:14.060] two
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:14.240] ways
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:14.360] to
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:14.520] deal
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:14.660] with
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:14.900] that.
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:15.560] One
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:15.680] of
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:15.840] which
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:15.980] is
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:16.100] to
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:16.260] look
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:16.340] at
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:16.460] all
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:16.560] the
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:16.780] technical
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.200] conditions,
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:17.420] make
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:17.580] sure
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:18.060] your
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:18.400] MDP
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:18.940] satisfies
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:19.140] those
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:19.380] technical
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:19.860] conditions.
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:20.760] The
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:20.980] second
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:21.320] case
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:21.780] is
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.560] basically
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:24.800] to
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:25.220] actually
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:25.420] use
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:25.520] the
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:25.760] average
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.240] reward
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:27.840] version
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:28.200] of
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:28.620] reinforcement
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:28.940] learning,
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:29.160] which
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:29.300] is
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:29.420] in
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:29.520] the
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:29.840] extension
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:30.120] to
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:30.880] this
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.200] class.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:31.460] I
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:31.580] think
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:31.700] you
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:31.800] did
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.060] have
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:32.200] a
[01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:34.310] reward
[01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.510] on
[01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.630] a
[01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.830] certain
[01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:35.270] edge
[01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.670] for
[01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:35.730] the
[01:14:35.730 --> 01:14:35.950] positive
[01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:36.410] cycle.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.060] Yes.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.020] Yeah,
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:47.140] I
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:47.320] should
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:47.420] have
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:47.660] added.
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:48.100] So
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:48.400] there
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:48.540] were
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:48.680] some
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:48.920] technical
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:49.400] conditions
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:49.620] to
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:49.760] my
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:50.060] answer
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:50.380] earlier,
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:50.640] which
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:50.900] were,
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:51.140] you
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:51.220] know,
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:51.480] with
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.540] certain
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:53.720] probability
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.220] transitions,
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:54.480] you,
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:54.820] sorry,
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:55.180] with
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:55.320] the
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:55.720] transition
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.120] probabilities
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:56.280] we
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:56.400] had
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:56.700] before,
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:56.840] it
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.020] wasn't
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:57.320] possible
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:57.500] to
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:57.700] have
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:14:59.440] infinite
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:14:59.840] sequences.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.080] Of
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:01.260] course,
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:01.400] if
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:01.500] you
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:01.660] have
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:02.060] a
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:02.340] self
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:02.660] cycle
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:02.800] with
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.080] probability
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:03.520] one,
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:04.520] that
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:04.760] does
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:04.920] have
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:05.020] an
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:05.340] infinite
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:06.540] cycle
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:06.740] that
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:06.900] can
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.040] be
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:07.220] drawn
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:07.440] from
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:07.600] that
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:07.880] sample.
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:08.180] So
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:08.280] you
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:08.440] have
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:08.540] to
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:08.720] have,
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:09.360] if
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:09.460] you
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:09.680] want,
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:10.460] if
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:10.580] you
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:10.760] want
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:10.880] to
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.020] deal
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:11.180] with
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:11.500] discounts
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:11.660] of
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:11.900] one,
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:12.380] there's
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:12.680] machinery
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:12.900] you
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:13.120] need.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:13.500] Let's
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:13.660] not
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:13.820] worry
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:14.020] about
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:14.260] that.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:14.480] Things
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:14.560] are
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:14.740] much
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:14.940] easier
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.080] when
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:15.160] we
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:15.260] have
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:15.700] discounting.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:16.620] OK.
[01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:19.070] Yeah,
[01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:19.370] yeah,
[01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.610] sorry.
[01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:19.930] So
[01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:22.970] it's
[01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:23.850] in
[01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:24.010] all
[01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:24.170] his
[01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:24.430] books,
[01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:24.710] but
[01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:25.550] so
[01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:26.050] neurodynamic
[01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:26.390] programming
[01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.570] is
[01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.830] there,
[01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.230] but
[01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:27.350] he
[01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.510] has
[01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.690] his
[01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:28.190] new
[01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:28.830] edition.
[01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.870] Probably
[01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:30.010] the
[01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:30.170] best
[01:15:30.170 --> 01:15:30.390] place
[01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.530] to
[01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.650] look
[01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:30.810] is
[01:15:30.810 --> 01:15:31.230] volume
[01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:31.590] two
[01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.730] of
[01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:31.870] his
[01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:32.070] new
[01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.390] edition
[01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.630] of
[01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.850] his
[01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:34.210] dynamic
[01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:34.690] programming.
[01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.590] Yes,
[01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:37.110] and
[01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.970] I
[01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:38.170] think
[01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:38.290] it's
[01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:38.490] volume
[01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:38.710] two
[01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:38.850] that
[01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:39.230] has
[01:15:39.230 --> 01:15:39.390] this
[01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.530] in.
[01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:43.010] OK,
[01:15:43.190 --> 01:15:43.470] so
[01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.650] we've
[01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:43.810] talked
[01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:43.990] about
[01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.230] optimal
[01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:44.510] value
[01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.930] function.
[01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:45.750] That
[01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:46.050] doesn't.
[01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.690] So
[01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:47.030] what
[01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.150] we
[01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:47.350] really
[01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.550] care
[01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.810] about,
[01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.970] you
[01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:48.030] know,
[01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.190] what's
[01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:48.270] the
[01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.390] thing
[01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.490] we
[01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:48.710] really
[01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:48.890] care
[01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:49.050] about?
[01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:49.190] We
[01:15:49.190 --> 01:15:49.350] care
[01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.510] about
[01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.630] the
[01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:49.850] optimal
[01:15:49.850 --> 01:15:50.290] policy.
[01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.670] So
[01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:51.790] the
[01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:52.030] optimal
[01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.530] policy,
[01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:53.170] we
[01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:53.330] need
[01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.430] to
[01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.770] understand
[01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:53.930] what
[01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:54.050] that
[01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:54.270] really
[01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:54.510] means.
[01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:54.770] What's
[01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.890] the
[01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:55.150] best
[01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:55.530] possible
[01:15:55.530 --> 01:15:55.770] way
[01:15:55.770 --> 01:15:55.930] to
[01:15:55.930 --> 01:15:56.290] behave
[01:15:56.290 --> 01:15:56.450] in
[01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.570] an
[01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.850] MDP?
[01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.570] So
[01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:57.690] we've
[01:15:57.690 --> 01:15:57.850] talked
[01:15:57.850 --> 01:15:58.050] about
[01:15:58.050 --> 01:15:58.470] policies.
[01:15:58.610 --> 01:15:58.650] A
[01:15:58.650 --> 01:15:58.870] policy
[01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:59.050] is
[01:15:59.050 --> 01:15:59.290] just
[01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:00.070] like
[01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.210] a
[01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:00.650] stochastic
[01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:01.010] mapping
[01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.170] and
[01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:01.390] mapping
[01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.630] from
[01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:01.950] states
[01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:02.130] to
[01:16:02.130 --> 01:16:02.450] actions
[01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.570] that
[01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:02.650] we
[01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:02.930] take.
[01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:03.670] And
[01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:03.890] now
[01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:04.010] we
[01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.110] want
[01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:04.210] to
[01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:04.490] understand,
[01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:04.610] well,
[01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.790] what's
[01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.890] the
[01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:05.070] best
[01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.250] one
[01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:05.350] of
[01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.530] these
[01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:05.830] things?
[01:16:06.450 --> 01:16:06.670] So
[01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:06.850] far,
[01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:07.010] we've
[01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.170] just
[01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:07.410] talked
[01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:07.610] about
[01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.810] how
[01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:08.030] much
[01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.310] juice
[01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.470] we
[01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.590] can
[01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:08.890] extract
[01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:09.070] from
[01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.170] the
[01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:09.370] system.
[01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.590] What's
[01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.690] the
[01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:09.950] maximum
[01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:10.150] amount
[01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:10.230] of
[01:16:10.230 --> 01:16:10.470] reward
[01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.610] we
[01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:10.710] can
[01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:10.950] get?
[01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:11.450] We
[01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:11.610] haven't
[01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:11.750] yet
[01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.990] talked
[01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.290] about
[01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:12.790] the
[01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:13.050] policy
[01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:13.430] itself.
[01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:14.890] And
[01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:15.030] so
[01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.350] to
[01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.650] understand
[01:16:15.650 --> 01:16:15.830] what
[01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.930] it
[01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:16.070] means
[01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.150] to
[01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:16.270] be
[01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.550] optimal,
[01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:17.030] we
[01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.170] need
[01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:17.270] to
[01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.670] define
[01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:17.810] a
[01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:18.010] notion
[01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:18.150] of
[01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:18.670] optimality.
[01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:19.750] And
[01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.850] to
[01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:19.970] do
[01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:20.130] that,
[01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:20.230] we
[01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:20.690] need
[01:16:20.690 --> 01:16:20.810] to
[01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.970] know
[01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:21.050] what
[01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:21.190] it
[01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:21.350] means
[01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.470] for
[01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.670] one
[01:16:21.670 --> 01:16:21.990] policy
[01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.170] to
[01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:22.330] be
[01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:22.590] better
[01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.770] than
[01:16:22.770 --> 01:16:23.010] another
[01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:23.430] policy.
[01:16:24.650 --> 01:16:24.850] And
[01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:24.950] so
[01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:25.070] what
[01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.190] we
[01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:25.370] do
[01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:25.470] is
[01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.570] we
[01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:25.750] actually
[01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:26.110] define
[01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.310] just
[01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.450] a
[01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:26.810] partial
[01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:27.230] ordering
[01:16:27.230 --> 01:16:27.410] of
[01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.510] the
[01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.850] policies.
[01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.590] So
[01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:28.710] this
[01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:29.070] partial
[01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:29.490] ordering
[01:16:29.490 --> 01:16:30.050] basically
[01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:30.410] tells
[01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.750] us,
[01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.310] let's
[01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.690] consider
[01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:32.430] two
[01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.930] policies,
[01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:33.990] pi
[01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.410] and
[01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:34.630] pi
[01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.950] prime.
[01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:36.150] So
[01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:36.290] these
[01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:36.390] are
[01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.570] two
[01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:36.850] arbitrary
[01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:37.410] policies.
[01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.830] And
[01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.950] we're
[01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:38.230] just
[01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:38.390] going
[01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.450] to
[01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.750] define
[01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.930] this
[01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:39.150] greater
[01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:39.350] than
[01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.470] or
[01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.710] equal
[01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:40.090] to
[01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:41.210] operator.
[01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:41.770] This
[01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:41.890] is
[01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:41.970] going
[01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:42.030] to
[01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:42.170] be
[01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:42.330] some
[01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:42.650] partial
[01:16:42.650 --> 01:16:43.110] ordering
[01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.390] over
[01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:43.730] policy
[01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:44.110] space.
[01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.650] It
[01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:44.950] basically
[01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:45.310] tells
[01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:45.490] us
[01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:45.630] the
[01:16:45.630 --> 01:16:45.970] intuitive
[01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:46.330] thing
[01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:46.770] that
[01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:46.950] one
[01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:47.270] policy
[01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.510] is
[01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:48.050] better
[01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.270] than
[01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.510] another
[01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:48.970] policy.
[01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.470] If
[01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.870] the
[01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:51.150] value
[01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:51.450] function
[01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:51.610] for
[01:16:51.610 --> 01:16:51.730] that
[01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:52.170] policy
[01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:52.830] is
[01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:53.130] greater
[01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:53.450] than
[01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.650] the
[01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:53.850] value
[01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:54.110] function
[01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.270] for
[01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:54.350] the
[01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.490] other
[01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:54.950] policy
[01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:55.370] in
[01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:55.550] all
[01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.890] states.
[01:16:59.010 --> 01:16:59.410] So
[01:16:59.410 --> 01:16:59.810] greater
[01:16:59.810 --> 01:17:00.010] than
[01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:00.110] or
[01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.290] equal
[01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.530] to
[01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.970] in
[01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:01.170] both
[01:17:01.170 --> 01:17:01.490] cases.
[01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:02.430] So
[01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.590] what
[01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.750] this
[01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:03.030] means
[01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.210] is
[01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:03.410] that
[01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.670] it
[01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:03.950] can't
[01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:04.090] be
[01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:04.390] worse.
[01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.430] It's
[01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.570] not
[01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:05.850] possible
[01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:06.090] to
[01:17:06.090 --> 01:17:06.270] say
[01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:06.430] a
[01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:06.690] policy
[01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:06.830] is
[01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:07.050] better
[01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:07.190] than
[01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:07.350] another
[01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.750] policy
[01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.930] if
[01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:08.050] it's
[01:17:08.050 --> 01:17:08.330] actually
[01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.630] worse
[01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.790] than
[01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.930] that
[01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:09.230] policy
[01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:09.370] in
[01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:09.530] one
[01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.790] state.
[01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:10.510] It
[01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.630] has
[01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.710] to
[01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:10.790] be
[01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.890] at
[01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:11.030] least
[01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.190] as
[01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:11.350] good
[01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.470] in
[01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.710] all
[01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:12.050] states
[01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:12.550] for
[01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.650] us
[01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:12.770] to
[01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.950] say
[01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:13.190] that
[01:17:13.190 --> 01:17:13.610] it's
[01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:13.830] greater
[01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.990] than
[01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.090] or
[01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.250] equal
[01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:14.370] in
[01:17:14.370 --> 01:17:14.450] the
[01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:14.650] partial
[01:17:14.650 --> 01:17:14.870] ordering.
[01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.650] And
[01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:16.830] then
[01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:17.050] there's
[01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:17.170] this
[01:17:17.170 --> 01:17:17.370] very
[01:17:17.370 --> 01:17:17.670] important
[01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:17.990] theorem,
[01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:18.170] which
[01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:18.310] you'll
[01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.570] find
[01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:18.730] in
[01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:19.210] all
[01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:19.510] the
[01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.750] important
[01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:20.050] texts
[01:17:20.050 --> 01:17:20.310] on
[01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:21.350] NDPs.
[01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:23.030] And
[01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.190] this
[01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:23.590] basically
[01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.930] tells
[01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:24.170] us
[01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:24.450] that
[01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:25.330] for
[01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:25.610] any
[01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:26.010] NDP,
[01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.910] any
[01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:27.230] NDP
[01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:27.450] at
[01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:27.690] all,
[01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:28.230] there
[01:17:28.230 --> 01:17:28.570] is
[01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:28.790] an
[01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:29.090] optimal
[01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:29.630] policy
[01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:30.250] that
[01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:30.450] is
[01:17:30.450 --> 01:17:30.890] better
[01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:31.050] than
[01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:31.190] or
[01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:31.410] equal
[01:17:31.410 --> 01:17:31.650] to
[01:17:31.650 --> 01:17:32.010] all
[01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:32.270] other
[01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.690] policies.
[01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:33.890] So
[01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.950] you
[01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:34.050] should
[01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:34.230] think
[01:17:34.230 --> 01:17:34.410] about
[01:17:34.410 --> 01:17:34.570] that.
[01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.630] It's
[01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.750] like,
[01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:34.990] wow,
[01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.270] OK,
[01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:35.670] this
[01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:35.770] is
[01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:35.850] a
[01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:35.950] good
[01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:36.250] thing.
[01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.590] You
[01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.650] know,
[01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:36.770] you
[01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:36.970] don't
[01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:37.150] end
[01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:37.270] up
[01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.370] with
[01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:37.510] this
[01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.690] weird
[01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:38.130] situation
[01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:38.510] where,
[01:17:38.650 --> 01:17:38.850] you
[01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:38.930] know,
[01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:39.310] sometimes
[01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.530] you
[01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:39.710] need
[01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:39.910] to
[01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:40.370] think
[01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.810] about
[01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:42.210] taking
[01:17:42.210 --> 01:17:42.410] this
[01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.730] policy
[01:17:42.730 --> 01:17:42.870] for
[01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.970] a
[01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:43.070] little
[01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.230] bit
[01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:43.330] of
[01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:43.410] the
[01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:43.650] NDP
[01:17:43.650 --> 01:17:43.870] and
[01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:44.010] this
[01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:44.170] other
[01:17:44.170 --> 01:17:44.450] policy
[01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.610] for
[01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:44.690] a
[01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:44.770] little
[01:17:44.770 --> 01:17:44.910] bit
[01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:45.010] of
[01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:45.090] the
[01:17:45.090 --> 01:17:45.310] NDP
[01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.570] and
[01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:45.730] that
[01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:46.210] combination
[01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:46.570] might
[01:17:46.570 --> 01:17:46.690] be
[01:17:46.690 --> 01:17:46.950] better.
[01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:47.470] There's
[01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.730] always
[01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:47.950] one
[01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:48.350] unique
[01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.790] policy.
[01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:49.530] Sorry,
[01:17:49.630 --> 01:17:49.770] there's
[01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:50.050] always
[01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:50.490] at
[01:17:50.490 --> 01:17:50.630] least

[01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:52.450] pi
[01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:52.750] star,
[01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.290] not
[01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:53.650] necessarily
[01:17:53.650 --> 01:17:53.990] unique,
[01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:54.510] that
[01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.650] is
[01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:54.910] better
[01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:55.190] than

[01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.170] So
[01:17:57.170 --> 01:17:57.310] there
[01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.450] is
[01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:57.830] always
[01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:58.030] an

[01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.850] There's,
[01:17:59.090 --> 01:17:59.190] you
[01:17:59.190 --> 01:17:59.330] can,
[01:17:59.690 --> 01:17:59.810] this

[01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.250] star
[01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:00.530] tells

[01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:01.010] way
[01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.110] to

[01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:01.470] in
[01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:01.570] your

[01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:02.450] that
[01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:02.690] will
[01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:03.070] extract
[01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.230] the

[01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:05.410] And
[01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:05.550] we've
[01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.710] already
[01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:05.970] seen

[01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:08.430] Like
[01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.510] if
[01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.590] you
[01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.770] have

[01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:10.550] pick
[01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.710] the

[01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:11.190] that
[01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:11.750] chooses
[01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.930] the

[01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:12.250] with

[01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:13.010] star,
[01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:13.570] that
[01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:13.790] gives
[01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.930] you
[01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:14.170] one
[01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:14.410] such

[01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:15.990] OK,
[01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.510] but
[01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:16.650] the

[01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:17.170] basically
[01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:17.450] tells
[01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:17.550] you
[01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:17.810] that's
[01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.990] true
[01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.150] for
[01:18:18.150 --> 01:18:18.390] any
[01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.710] NDP,
[01:18:18.930 --> 01:18:19.030] that
[01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.210] this
[01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:19.470] really
[01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:19.710] is
[01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:19.850] the
[01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:20.070] best
[01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.270] thing
[01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.410] that
[01:18:20.410 --> 01:18:20.530] you
[01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:20.650] could
[01:18:20.650 --> 01:18:20.930] find
[01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:21.050] at
[01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.150] the
[01:18:21.150 --> 01:18:21.410] NDP.
[01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:21.690] There's
[01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:21.850] not
[01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:21.970] going
[01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:21.990] to
[01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.110] be
[01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.290] some
[01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:22.470] other
[01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.670] thing
[01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:22.870] that's
[01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:23.170] better
[01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:23.790] just
[01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.990] by,
[01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.370] it's
[01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:24.530] not
[01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:24.710] like
[01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:24.910] some
[01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:25.270] weird
[01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.830] averaging
[01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:26.390] policy
[01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.630] that's
[01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.710] going
[01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:26.770] to
[01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:26.870] do
[01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:27.090] better
[01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:27.270] than
[01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.470] this.
[01:18:29.150 --> 01:18:29.550] Furthermore,
[01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:30.210] it
[01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:30.450] is
[01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:30.730] possible
[01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:30.890] to
[01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:31.010] have
[01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.210] more
[01:18:31.210 --> 01:18:31.370] than
[01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.550] one
[01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.810] optimal
[01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:32.250] policy.
[01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.350] So
[01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.490] it's
[01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:33.790] possible
[01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:34.030] that,
[01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:34.250] for
[01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.490] example,
[01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:34.670] the
[01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:34.910] simplest
[01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:35.190] case
[01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:35.350] is
[01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.530] that
[01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:36.190] imagine
[01:18:36.190 --> 01:18:36.390] there's
[01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.570] one
[01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:36.830] action
[01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.970] in
[01:18:36.970 --> 01:18:37.090] your
[01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:37.510] NDP
[01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:38.210] where
[01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:38.590] there's
[01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.950] two
[01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:39.350] separate
[01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.710] actions
[01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:39.910] that
[01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:40.110] take
[01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:40.210] you
[01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:40.310] to
[01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.430] the
[01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.570] same
[01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:40.910] state.
[01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.610] It
[01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:41.770] doesn't
[01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:41.950] really
[01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:42.170] matter
[01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:42.350] which
[01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.490] one
[01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:42.570] of
[01:18:42.570 --> 01:18:42.770] those
[01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:43.050] you
[01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:43.390] take.
[01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:43.830] You're
[01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.850] going
[01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.910] to
[01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:44.030] end
[01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.170] up
[01:18:44.170 --> 01:18:44.250] in
[01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:44.370] the

[01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:44.870] state.
[01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:45.890] They
[01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:46.170] both
[01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:46.350] can
[01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:46.490] be
[01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.810] optimal.
[01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.630] It
[01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:47.770] doesn't
[01:18:47.770 --> 01:18:48.010] matter

[01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:48.310] one
[01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.390] of

[01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:48.630] you
[01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.890] choose.
[01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.050] You
[01:18:49.050 --> 01:18:49.150] can
[01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:49.290] get
[01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:49.430] the
[01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.650] same
[01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:49.930] optimal
[01:18:49.930 --> 01:18:50.230] value
[01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:50.410] out
[01:18:50.410 --> 01:18:50.490] of
[01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:50.630] this
[01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.950] NDP,
[01:18:51.330 --> 01:18:51.470] whether
[01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.590] you
[01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.710] go
[01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:51.930] left
[01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:52.070] or
[01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.170] go
[01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:52.450] right.
[01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:53.550] OK,
[01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:53.750] so
[01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.870] there
[01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:54.250] can
[01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:54.430] be

[01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:56.450] But
[01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.810] if
[01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:56.930] they
[01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:57.150] are
[01:18:57.150 --> 01:18:57.470] optimal,
[01:18:57.810 --> 01:18:57.990] then
[01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.330] all
[01:18:58.330 --> 01:18:58.670] optimal
[01:18:58.670 --> 01:18:59.170] policies
[01:18:59.170 --> 01:18:59.770] achieve,
[01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:00.110] they
[01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.410] extract
[01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.570] the
[01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:00.750] same
[01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.950] amount
[01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:01.070] of

[01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.530] from
[01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:01.630] the

[01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:02.030] They
[01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.150] get
[01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:02.250] the

[01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:03.790] So
[01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.930] the

[01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:04.490] functions

[01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:05.090] policies
[01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.230] are
[01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:05.330] the

[01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.750] And
[01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:09.110] specifically,
[01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.370] the

[01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:12.030] can
[01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.190] be

[01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.770] by

[01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.890] Yeah.
[01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:18.190] OK,
[01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.450] so
[01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:18.650] the

[01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:20.070] of

[01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.670] star
[01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.910] is

[01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:26.130] earlier.
[01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.530] So
[01:19:26.530 --> 01:19:26.650] the
[01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:26.850] V
[01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:27.050] star

[01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.930] slides
[01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:29.470] are

[01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.170] that
[01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:31.290] you
[01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:31.730] extract
[01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:32.530] if
[01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:32.630] you
[01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.810] try
[01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.990] to

[01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:34.430] policy.
[01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:35.390] So
[01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.490] if
[01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:35.570] you
[01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.710] look
[01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:35.810] at
[01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:35.950] how
[01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:36.150] good
[01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:36.270] the
[01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:36.470] optimal
[01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.810] policy
[01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:37.050] is,
[01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.330] then
[01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:37.890] it
[01:19:37.890 --> 01:19:38.050] is
[01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:38.350] indeed
[01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.610] the
[01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:38.890] maximum
[01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:39.150] amount
[01:19:39.150 --> 01:19:39.310] that
[01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.530] we
[01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.690] thought
[01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:39.830] we
[01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.930] could
[01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:40.090] get
[01:19:40.090 --> 01:19:40.230] out
[01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:40.330] of
[01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:40.390] the
[01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.570] system.
[01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:41.290] So
[01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:41.410] this
[01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:41.530] is
[01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:41.670] like
[01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:41.810] a
[01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:42.090] sanity
[01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:42.850] theorem,
[01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:43.090] like
[01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:43.370] all
[01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:43.530] the
[01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:43.710] things
[01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:43.830] you
[01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.950] would
[01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:44.110] hope
[01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:44.210] to
[01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:44.330] be
[01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.530] true
[01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:44.770] are
[01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:45.050] true
[01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.490] and
[01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:45.810] everything
[01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:46.050] is
[01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:46.290] sane.
[01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.850] And
[01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:47.030] there
[01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.150] is
[01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:47.310] this
[01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.470] thing
[01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.610] called
[01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:47.730] an
[01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:47.910] optimal
[01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:48.330] policy
[01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:48.830] and
[01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.950] it
[01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:49.130] does
[01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.290] give
[01:19:49.290 --> 01:19:49.370] you
[01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:49.490] the
[01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:49.770] maximum
[01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:49.990] amount
[01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.130] you
[01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:50.250] can
[01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:50.410] get
[01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:50.570] from
[01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.770] your
[01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:51.550] MDP.
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:53.960] OK,
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.320] so
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:54.740] how
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:54.820] do
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:54.900] we
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:55.120] find
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:55.300] this
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:55.520] thing?
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:56.300] Well,
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:56.480] we've
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:56.640] already
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:56.900] seen
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:57.080] this
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:57.560] intuitively.
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:57.820] So
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:57.960] this
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:58.060] is
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:58.220] just
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:58.500] writing
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:58.640] it
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:19:58.840] down
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.140] in
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:19:59.920] equations.
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:00.700] It's
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:00.860] just
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:01.100] saying
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:01.220] that
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:01.360] all
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:01.500] we
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:01.780] need
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:01.960] is
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.940] you
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:03.220] solve
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:03.360] for
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:03.540] Q
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:03.780] star
[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:04.400] and
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:04.540] then
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:04.680] you
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:04.900] pick
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.060] the
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:05.340] action
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:05.500] that
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:05.660] gives
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:05.760] you
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:05.860] the
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:06.020] most
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:06.200] Q
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:06.440] star.
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:07.200] So
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:07.300] in
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:07.480] every
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:07.900] state,
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:08.560] what
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:08.660] do
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:08.700] you
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.000] do
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:09.320] if
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:09.420] you're
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:09.540] in
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:09.740] state
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:10.060] S?
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:11.200] Well,
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:11.360] you
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:11.540] just
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:11.860] pick
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:12.000] the
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:12.260] action
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:12.520] A
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:12.700] with
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:12.980] probability
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:13.520] one
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:14.640] that
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.040] maximizes
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:15.280] Q
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:15.580] star
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:16.100] and
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:16.280] that
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:16.440] is
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:16.560] the
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:16.800] action
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:16.980] that
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:17.180] will
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:17.800] give
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:17.880] you
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.140] maximum
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:18.500] possible
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:18.900] reward.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:20.600] And
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:20.680] there
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:20.800] is
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:21.320] always,
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.040] always
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:22.240] a
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:22.800] deterministic
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:23.320] optimal
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:23.780] policy.
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:25.060] So
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:25.240] not
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:25.400] only
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:25.480] is
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:25.560] there
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:25.660] an
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:25.840] optimal
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:26.180] policy,
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:26.440] there's
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:26.540] a
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:27.060] deterministic
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:27.340] optimal
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:27.780] policy
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:28.460] and
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:28.720] this
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.160] gives
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:29.260] you
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:29.500] one
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:29.680] such
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.200] deterministic
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:30.540] optimal
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:30.880] policy.
[01:20:33.610 --> 01:20:34.010] And
[01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:34.110] the
[01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.230] good
[01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:34.370] thing
[01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.570] about
[01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:34.850] this
[01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:35.070] is,
[01:20:35.690 --> 01:20:35.790] you
[01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:35.850] know,
[01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:36.010] once
[01:20:36.010 --> 01:20:36.170] we've
[01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:36.290] got
[01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.490] Q
[01:20:36.490 --> 01:20:36.690] star,
[01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:36.890] we're
[01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:37.070] done.
[01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:37.830] The
[01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:38.010] game
[01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:38.210] is
[01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:38.690] solved.
[01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:38.910] We're
[01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:39.110] happy.
[01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:40.990] So
[01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.390] let's
[01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.510] do
[01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.690] this
[01:20:41.690 --> 01:20:42.350] one
[01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.550] last
[01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.790] time
[01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.970] back
[01:20:42.970 --> 01:20:43.070] at
[01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.250] our
[01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:43.530] student
[01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:43.890] MDP.
[01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.950] So
[01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:45.270] now
[01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:46.030] what
[01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.210] we're
[01:20:46.210 --> 01:20:46.250] going
[01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.250] to
[01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.390] look
[01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.530] at
[01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:46.650] is
[01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:46.770] the
[01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:47.010] optimal
[01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:47.510] policy.
[01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:49.670] So
[01:20:49.670 --> 01:20:50.110] now
[01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.290] what
[01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:50.410] we're
[01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:50.610] looking
[01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:50.850] at
[01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:51.010] is
[01:20:51.010 --> 01:20:51.230] these
[01:20:51.230 --> 01:20:51.650] arcs,
[01:20:51.730 --> 01:20:51.890] remember,
[01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.330] represent
[01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:52.550] the
[01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.910] actions
[01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:53.050] that
[01:20:53.050 --> 01:20:53.150] we
[01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:53.270] can
[01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.550] take,
[01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:53.790] like
[01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:53.930] we
[01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:54.050] can

[01:20:59.130 --> 01:20:59.310] And

[01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:04.050] value.
[01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:04.490] The

[01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:09.150] This

[01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:11.470] So
[01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:11.590] it's
[01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.770] just

[01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.710] But
[01:21:17.710 --> 01:21:17.830] we
[01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.930] can
[01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:18.110] see

[01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.450] just
[01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:19.590] by

[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:55.740] values?
[01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:55.940] These

[01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:57.160] time
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:57.260] and
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:57.460] again,
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:57.660] they're
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:57.940] central.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:58.400] This
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:58.500] is
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:21:58.600] the

[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:00.040] out
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:00.200] so
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:00.280] that
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:00.380] we
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:00.500] can
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:00.680] just
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.020] bang,
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:01.540] hit
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:01.680] the

[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:04.720] further
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:05.060] thought.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:06.680] So
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:06.820] once
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:06.940] we
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:07.080] have

[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:08.260] We've
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:08.440] solved

[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:09.060] How
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:09.200] do
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:09.280] we
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:09.500] arrive
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:09.620] at

[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:09.960] star?
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:10.460] So
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:10.860] intuitively,
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:11.180] what
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:11.320] did
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:11.420] we
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:11.700] do?
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:12.200] Well,
[01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:12.300] we
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:12.460] kind
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:12.540] of
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:12.740] worked
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:12.860] our

[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:13.340] backwards.
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:13.760] We
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.040] started
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:14.280] off
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:14.380] at
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:14.520] this
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:14.820] final
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:15.220] state.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:16.340] We
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:16.560] looked
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:16.700] at
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:17.020] the
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:17.520] value
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:17.620] of
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:17.820] taking
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:18.040] this
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:18.300] arc,
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:19.040] which
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:19.360] was
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:19.700] kind
[01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:19.780] of
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:20.140] trivially
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:20.500] 10.
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:21.020] You
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:21.200] go
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:21.320] to
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:21.520] here,
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:21.680] you
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.240] finish,
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:22.740] you
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:22.880] get
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.100] plus
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:23.280] 10
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:23.440] along
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:23.580] the
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:23.760] way.
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:24.280] And
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:24.360] then
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:24.460] we
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:24.660] worked
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:24.780] our
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:24.880] way
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.180] backwards
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:25.380] and
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:25.500] we
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:25.640] kind
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:25.700] of
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:25.820] did
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:25.960] this
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:26.140] look
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:26.380] ahead
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.180] with
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:27.260] a
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:27.400] one
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:27.600] step
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:27.800] look
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.000] ahead
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:28.160] where
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:28.260] we
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:28.520] started
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:28.760] here
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:28.860] and
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:28.940] we
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:29.100] said,
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:29.400] OK,
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:29.900] you
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:30.100] start
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:30.320] here,
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:30.440] you
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:30.580] look
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:30.760] ahead
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:30.960] one
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:31.240] step,
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:31.380] you
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:31.520] end
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:31.660] up
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:31.780] with
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.080] 10.
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:33.880] Work
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:34.000] your
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:34.120] way
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:34.460] backwards.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:35.380] And
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:35.540] that
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:35.880] working
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.240] backwards
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:36.500] is
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:36.940] precisely
[01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:37.160] what
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:37.280] we
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:37.420] get
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:37.600] out
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:37.740] of
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:38.160] a
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:38.380] Bellman
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:38.760] equation.
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:39.980] So
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:40.180] now
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:40.320] what
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:40.440] we're
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:40.540] going
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:40.640] to
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:40.800] talk
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.020] about
[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:41.200] is
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:41.500] a
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:41.940] Bellman
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:42.480] optimality
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:42.900] equation.
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:43.720] So
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:43.820] if
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:43.900] you
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.060] just
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:44.260] open
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:44.380] a
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:44.640] textbook
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:44.820] and
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:44.960] hear
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:45.140] about
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:45.340] the
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:45.600] Bellman
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.020] equation
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:46.380] for
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:46.980] MDPs,
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:47.300] they're
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:47.460] talking
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:47.640] about
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:47.800] this
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:47.980] one,
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:48.140] not
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:48.220] the
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:48.300] one
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:48.420] we
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:48.580] looked
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:48.740] at
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.040] before.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:49.560] It's
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:49.640] the
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:49.840] Bellman
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.280] optimality
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:50.640] equation.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:50.880] This
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:50.980] is
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:51.080] the
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:51.160] one
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:51.300] that
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:51.500] tells
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:51.640] you
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:51.780] how
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:51.980] to
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:52.580] really
[01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:52.920] solve
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.080] your
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:53.380] MDP.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:54.140] The
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:54.300] one
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:54.460] that
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:54.680] tells
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:54.840] you,
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:54.940] you
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:55.020] know,
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:55.200] how
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:55.320] do
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:55.400] you
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:55.760] relate
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:56.000] the
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:56.340] optimal
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:56.620] value
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:56.920] function
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.100] to
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:57.360] itself?
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:58.320] So
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:58.640] before
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:58.840] we
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:22:59.020] looked
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:22:59.120] at
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:22:59.220] the
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:22:59.520] Bellman
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.100] expectation
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:00.700] equation
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:01.140] for
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:01.620] MDPs,
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:01.720] which
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:01.940] told
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:02.100] us
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:02.340] how
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:03.000] V
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:03.400] pi
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.340] related
[01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:04.540] to
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:04.840] itself.
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:05.140] So
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:05.300] we
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:05.480] looked
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:05.600] at,
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:05.740] for
[01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:06.060] example,
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.320] you
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:07.440] know,
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:07.660] under
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:07.880] this
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.300] average
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:08.720] behavior
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:09.280] policy
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:09.460] where
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:09.580] you
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:09.740] might
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:09.920] go
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:10.440] right
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:10.740] or
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:11.000] left
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:11.140] with
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:11.340] equal
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:11.880] probability.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:12.800] How
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:12.940] did
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:13.020] the
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:13.280] values
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:13.520] relate
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:13.660] to
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:14.000] themselves?
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:14.460] Now
[01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:14.580] we're
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:14.740] looking
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:14.900] at
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:15.080] really
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:15.260] the
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:15.600] optimal
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:15.940] values.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:16.100] We're
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:16.240] looking
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:16.320] at
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:16.400] the
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:16.620] best
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:16.860] things.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:17.060] We're
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:17.220] looking
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:17.380] at
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:17.620] these,
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:19.260] you
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:19.620] know,
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:19.840] something
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:20.080] like
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:20.360] these,
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:20.700] these
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:21.020] red
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:21.440] highlighted
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:21.760] guys,
[01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:21.980] like
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:22.240] the
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:22.580] values
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:22.740] in
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:22.940] these
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:23.280] circles.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:23.580] Now,
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:24.240] six,
[01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:24.540] six,
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:24.780] eight,
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:25.020] 10,
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:25.280] the
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:25.640] maximum
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:25.880] amount
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.020] of
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:26.180] juice
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:26.300] you
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:26.400] can
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:26.540] get
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:26.680] from
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:26.800] your
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.100] system.
[01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:27.720] How
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:27.880] does
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.060] that
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:28.280] number
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:28.580] relate
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:28.700] to
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:29.020] itself?
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:30.400] And
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:30.520] what
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:30.640] we
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:30.720] can
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:30.920] do
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:31.060] is
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:31.200] do
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:31.400] like
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:31.480] a
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:31.640] one
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:31.800] step
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.000] look
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:32.200] ahead
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:32.480] again.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:33.000] And
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:33.100] so
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:33.200] the
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:33.320] way
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:33.440] to
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:33.800] understand
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:34.060] this
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:34.180] is
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:34.500] again,
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:34.960] by
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.060] this
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:35.220] one
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:35.380] step
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:35.580] look
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:35.760] ahead,
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:35.900] you
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:36.180] start
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:36.360] in,
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:36.800] you
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:36.900] can
[01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:37.100] ask,
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:37.240] well,
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:37.520] what's
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:37.720] the
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.060] optimal
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:38.340] value
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:38.460] of
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:38.600] being
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:38.760] in
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:38.920] some
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:39.340] state
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:40.160] where
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:40.240] you
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:40.360] can
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:40.780] consider
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:41.600] each
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:41.740] of
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:41.860] the
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:42.200] actions
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:42.380] that
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:42.480] you
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:42.680] might
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:43.100] take
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:44.260] will
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:44.500] take
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:44.660] you
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:44.920] to
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:45.300] one
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:45.400] of
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:45.620] these
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:46.180] chance
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:46.440] nodes
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:46.760] here,
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:47.180] one
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:47.260] of
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:47.380] these
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:47.720] action
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:48.100] nodes.
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:49.420] And
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:49.520] we
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:49.640] can
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:49.920] say,
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:51.540] when
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:51.660] we
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:51.860] reach
[01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:52.020] that
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:52.320] action,
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:52.580] we
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:52.720] can
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:52.900] look
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:53.100] at
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:53.660] the
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:53.960] action
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:54.340] value.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:54.860] This
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:54.980] is
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:55.140] the
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:55.320] red
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:55.700] arc,
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:55.960] the
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:56.160] number
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:56.280] on
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:56.340] the
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:56.480] red
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:56.760] arc.
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:57.380] We
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:57.480] can
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:57.740] say
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:58.240] this
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:58.420] had
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:23:58.540] a
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:58.680] number
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:58.820] on
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:23:58.880] the
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:23:59.020] red
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:23:59.260] arc,
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:23:59.540] which
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:00.100] was
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:00.400] eight.
[01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:00.560] And
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:00.680] this
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:00.800] had
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:00.900] a
[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:01.040] number
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:01.180] on
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:01.280] the
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:01.400] red
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:01.600] arc,
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:01.780] which
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:01.960] was
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:02.300] 10
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:02.400] or
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:02.580] whatever
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:02.720] it
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:02.920] was.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:03.560] And
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:03.860] now
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:04.140] what
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:04.280] we
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:04.480] do
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:04.640] is
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:04.880] instead
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:05.000] of
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:05.180] taking
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:05.380] the
[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:05.660] average
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:05.820] of
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:06.000] these
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:06.340] guys,
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:06.660] we
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:06.820] take
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:06.960] the
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.180] max
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:07.380] over
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:07.600] these
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:07.880] guys.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:08.680] So
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.020] basically
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:09.440] saying,
[01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:10.220] look
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:10.420] at
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:10.560] the
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:10.860] value
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:11.160] of
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:11.360] each
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:11.460] of
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:11.540] the
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:11.800] actions
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:11.980] you
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.100] can
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:12.420] take
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:13.220] and
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:13.380] pick
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:13.520] the
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:13.700] max
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:13.860] of
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:14.020] them.
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:14.420] And
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:14.600] that's
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:14.680] going
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:14.720] to
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:14.880] tell
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:14.960] you
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.080] how
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:15.260] good
[01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:15.360] it
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:15.500] is
[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:15.600] to
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:15.740] be
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:15.860] in
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:16.000] this
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:16.220] state
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:16.480] here.
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:17.900] It's
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:18.100] simply
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:18.280] the
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:18.540] max
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:18.660] of
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:18.780] all
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:18.900] the
[01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:19.000] Q
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:19.360] values.
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.000] I
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:21.100] can
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:21.220] go

[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:21.580] I
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:21.680] can

[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:22.040] right.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:22.200] I
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:22.360] look
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:22.460] at
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:22.580] how
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:22.780] much
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.020] reward
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:23.140] I
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:23.240] get
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:23.340] in
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:23.480] each
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:23.740] case
[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:23.840] and
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:23.960] I
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:24.080] pick
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:24.220] the
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:24.340] one
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:24.460] that
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:25.220] gives
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:25.360] me
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:25.480] the
[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:25.720] most.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.100] Okay.
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:27.800] So
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:27.940] the
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:28.160] value
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:28.440] function

[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:32.860] you
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:32.980] can
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:33.220] take
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:33.400] from
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:33.540] that
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:33.820] state.
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:35.660] Okay.
[01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:38.250] Now
[01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:38.430] we're
[01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.450] going
[01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:38.510] to
[01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.630] do
[01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:38.810] the
[01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:39.070] other
[01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.510] half.
[01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:40.030] So
[01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:40.290] remember
[01:24:40.290 --> 01:24:40.470] we
[01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.670] had
[01:24:40.670 --> 01:24:41.390] V
[01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.590] going
[01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.730] to
[01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:41.910] Q.
[01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:42.110] Now
[01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.230] we're
[01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:42.330] going
[01:24:42.330 --> 01:24:42.390] to
[01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.530] do
[01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:42.710] Q
[01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:42.910] going
[01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:43.050] to
[01:24:43.050 --> 01:24:43.270] V.
[01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:44.770] So
[01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:44.930] now
[01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:45.030] we
[01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.170] want
[01:24:45.170 --> 01:24:45.270] to
[01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.470] know,
[01:24:45.650 --> 01:24:45.690] well,
[01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:46.010] how
[01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.170] good
[01:24:46.170 --> 01:24:46.270] is
[01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.390] one
[01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.470] of
[01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.630] those
[01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:46.810] red
[01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:47.150] arcs
[01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:47.230] in
[01:24:47.230 --> 01:24:47.390] that
[01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.690] diagram?
[01:24:47.890 --> 01:24:48.030] How
[01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.490] do
[01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:48.610] we
[01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:48.930] know
[01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.710] what
[01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:49.850] the
[01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:50.070] optimal
[01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.350] value
[01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:50.550] is
[01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.650] for
[01:24:50.650 --> 01:24:50.850] being
[01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:50.950] in
[01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:51.010] a
[01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:51.230] particular
[01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:51.610] state
[01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:51.850] and
[01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:52.070] taking
[01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.190] a
[01:24:52.190 --> 01:24:52.410] particular
[01:24:52.410 --> 01:24:52.790] action?
[01:24:53.210 --> 01:24:53.390] How
[01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.470] do
[01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.570] we
[01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:53.750] know
[01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.930] that
[01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:54.390] the
[01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:55.330] study
[01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:55.630] arc
[01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:55.830] has
[01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.930] a
[01:24:55.930 --> 01:24:56.270] particular
[01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.770] optimal
[01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:57.050] value
[01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:57.210] to
[01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:57.370] it?
[01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.970] Well,
[01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:58.170] again,
[01:24:58.190 --> 01:24:58.290] we
[01:24:58.290 --> 01:24:58.390] can
[01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.490] do
[01:24:58.490 --> 01:24:58.570] a
[01:24:58.570 --> 01:24:58.730] one
[01:24:58.730 --> 01:24:59.110] step
[01:24:59.110 --> 01:24:59.330] look
[01:24:59.330 --> 01:24:59.590] ahead.
[01:25:00.370 --> 01:25:00.650] But
[01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:00.830] now
[01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:01.150] we're
[01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:01.350] looking
[01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.530] ahead
[01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:01.670] over
[01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:01.830] what
[01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:02.170] the
[01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:02.590] dynamics
[01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:02.790] might
[01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.910] do,
[01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:03.050] what
[01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:03.150] the
[01:25:03.150 --> 01:25:03.450] environment
[01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:03.710] might
[01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:03.870] do
[01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:04.010] to
[01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:04.130] us,
[01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:04.330] where
[01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:04.450] the
[01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:04.610] wind
[01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.790] might
[01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.970] blow
[01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:05.130] us.
[01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:05.270] We
[01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.450] don't
[01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.810] control
[01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:06.090] this.
[01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:06.730] This
[01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:06.830] is
[01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.990] like
[01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.150] going
[01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:07.250] to
[01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:07.370] the
[01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.550] pub
[01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.710] and
[01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:07.910] then,
[01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:08.250] you
[01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:08.310] know,
[01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:08.450] we
[01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:08.590] don't
[01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:08.730] know
[01:25:08.730 --> 01:25:08.850] what
[01:25:08.850 --> 01:25:08.990] will
[01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.190] happen
[01:25:09.190 --> 01:25:09.250] in
[01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:09.390] the
[01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:09.610] pub,
[01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.830] it's
[01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:10.310] a
[01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.530] crazy
[01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:10.870] place
[01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.970] and
[01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:11.070] we
[01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.210] might
[01:25:11.210 --> 01:25:11.370] end
[01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:11.490] up
[01:25:11.490 --> 01:25:11.590] in
[01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.730] all
[01:25:11.730 --> 01:25:11.990] these
[01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.270] different
[01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:12.850] situations.
[01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:14.030] And
[01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.250] each
[01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:14.350] of
[01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.530] those
[01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:14.770] states
[01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:14.910] that
[01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:14.990] we
[01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.130] end
[01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:15.310] up
[01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.530] in
[01:25:15.930 --> 01:25:16.250] has
[01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.450] some
[01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:16.730] optimal
[01:25:16.730 --> 01:25:17.050] value.
[01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:18.210] And
[01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:18.270] so
[01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.370] we
[01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:18.570] kind
[01:25:18.570 --> 01:25:18.690] of,
[01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.950] you
[01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.990] know,
[01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.150] this
[01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:19.250] is
[01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.390] like
[01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.490] an
[01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.910] inductive
[01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:20.210] argument.
[01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:20.430] We
[01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:20.570] sort
[01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:20.670] of
[01:25:20.670 --> 01:25:20.950] assume
[01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:21.110] that
[01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.230] we
[01:25:21.230 --> 01:25:21.570] know
[01:25:23.050 --> 01:25:23.370] inductively
[01:25:23.370 --> 01:25:23.690] the

[01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:24.370] of
[01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:24.510] each
[01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:24.610] of
[01:25:24.610 --> 01:25:24.750] those
[01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:25.030] states
[01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.270] that
[01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.410] we
[01:25:25.410 --> 01:25:25.570] might
[01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:25.730] end
[01:25:25.730 --> 01:25:25.890] up
[01:25:25.890 --> 01:25:26.090] in.
[01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:27.470] And
[01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.730] if
[01:25:27.730 --> 01:25:27.850] we
[01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:28.150] know
[01:25:28.150 --> 01:25:29.110] the

[01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:29.810] those
[01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:30.050] states
[01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:30.170] that
[01:25:30.170 --> 01:25:30.230] we
[01:25:30.230 --> 01:25:30.370] might

[01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:30.690] up
[01:25:30.690 --> 01:25:30.870] in,
[01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:31.390] we
[01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:31.590] just
[01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.750] need
[01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.890] to
[01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:32.210] average
[01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:32.470] over
[01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.630] them
[01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:32.810] now.
[01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:33.070] There's
[01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.250] no
[01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:33.510] max
[01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.650] here.
[01:25:33.710 --> 01:25:33.790] We
[01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:33.930] don't
[01:25:33.930 --> 01:25:34.070] get

[01:25:35.850 --> 01:25:35.990] We

[01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.630] us
[01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:39.830] how
[01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:40.030] good
[01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.170] our
[01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:40.390] action
[01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.710] is.
[01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.670] So
[01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:41.790] our
[01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:42.070] action
[01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.670] is,
[01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:43.510] the
[01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.870] optimal
[01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:44.190] action
[01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:44.550] value
[01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:45.050] is
[01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:45.230] just
[01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:45.370] the
[01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:45.630] immediate
[01:25:45.630 --> 01:25:46.150] reward
[01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:46.730] plus
[01:25:46.730 --> 01:25:46.950] the
[01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:47.410] average
[01:25:47.410 --> 01:25:47.890] over
[01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:48.450] all
[01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:48.770] the
[01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:49.170] probability
[01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:49.410] that
[01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:49.550] the
[01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.830] wind
[01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.990] might
[01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.130] blow
[01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:50.270] us
[01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.550] left,
[01:25:50.670 --> 01:25:50.790] the
[01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:51.070] probability
[01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.270] the
[01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.370] wind
[01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:51.550] might
[01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.670] blow
[01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:51.830] us
[01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:52.150] right,
[01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.550] multiplied
[01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.910] by
[01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:54.190] the
[01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:54.550] optimal
[01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.910] value
[01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:55.050] of
[01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:55.210] being
[01:25:55.210 --> 01:25:55.310] in
[01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.470] that
[01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.750] state.
[01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:57.510] Okay.
[01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:00.730] And
[01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:01.010] again,
[01:26:01.170 --> 01:26:01.390] what
[01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.510] we
[01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.610] can
[01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:01.850] do
[01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:02.070] is
[01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.390] put
[01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.590] those
[01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:02.770] two
[01:26:02.770 --> 01:26:03.010] pieces
[01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:03.450] together.
[01:26:03.850 --> 01:26:04.110] When
[01:26:04.110 --> 01:26:04.250] you
[01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:04.390] put
[01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.550] those
[01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.710] two
[01:26:04.710 --> 01:26:04.950] pieces
[01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:05.270] together,
[01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.430] you
[01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.590] have
[01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.730] a
[01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:06.150] recursive
[01:26:06.150 --> 01:26:06.750] relationship
[01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:07.270] that
[01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.590] relates
[01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.870] V
[01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:08.110] star
[01:26:08.110 --> 01:26:08.390] to
[01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.750] itself.
[01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:09.630] So
[01:26:09.630 --> 01:26:09.810] this
[01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:10.010] gives
[01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.130] us
[01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:10.230] an
[01:26:10.230 --> 01:26:10.570] equation
[01:26:10.570 --> 01:26:10.750] that
[01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:10.830] we
[01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:10.990] can
[01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:11.250] solve.
[01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.410] Okay.
[01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.970] So
[01:26:12.970 --> 01:26:13.110] this
[01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.190] is
[01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:13.370] now
[01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.590] a
[01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:14.010] two
[01:26:14.010 --> 01:26:14.270]-step
[01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.490] look
[01:26:14.490 --> 01:26:14.650] ahead.
[01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.830] We're
[01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:15.010] looking
[01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:15.230] at
[01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:15.570] ahead
[01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:16.250] over
[01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:16.750] the
[01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:17.030] actions
[01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.230] we
[01:26:17.230 --> 01:26:17.390] can
[01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.750] take
[01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:18.410] here
[01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.970] and
[01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:19.490] maximizing
[01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.710] over
[01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:20.030] those.
[01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.610] And
[01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:20.730] we're
[01:26:20.730 --> 01:26:21.010] also
[01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:21.290] looking
[01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.690] ahead
[01:26:21.690 --> 01:26:22.170] over
[01:26:22.170 --> 01:26:22.650] the
[01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:23.110] dice
[01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.290] that
[01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:23.410] the
[01:26:23.410 --> 01:26:23.690] environment
[01:26:23.690 --> 01:26:23.990] might
[01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.230] roll.
[01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.970] And
[01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:25.070] we
[01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.250] don't
[01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.650] maximize
[01:26:25.650 --> 01:26:25.970] over
[01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:26.110] the
[01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:26.310] dice.
[01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.450] We
[01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:26.610] don't
[01:26:26.610 --> 01:26:26.930] control
[01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:27.090] the
[01:26:27.090 --> 01:26:27.390] dice.
[01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:28.130] Instead,
[01:26:28.230 --> 01:26:28.310] we
[01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.650] average
[01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:28.830] over
[01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:28.990] the
[01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.170] dice
[01:26:29.170 --> 01:26:29.330] that
[01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:29.430] the
[01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.690] environment
[01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:29.930] can
[01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:30.130] roll.
[01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.550] We
[01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.690] do
[01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:30.850] this
[01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:31.050] two
[01:26:31.050 --> 01:26:31.250]-step
[01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.470] look
[01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:31.730] ahead
[01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:32.250] over
[01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:32.590] our
[01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:33.070] actions
[01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.430] from
[01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.610] this
[01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:33.890] state
[01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:34.330] and
[01:26:34.330 --> 01:26:34.490] all
[01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:34.590] the
[01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:34.770] things
[01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:34.870] the
[01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:35.130] environment
[01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:35.350] might
[01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.490] do
[01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:35.650] to
[01:26:35.650 --> 01:26:35.870] us.
[01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:36.190] And
[01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:36.250] then
[01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:36.330] we
[01:26:36.330 --> 01:26:36.550] look
[01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.670] at
[01:26:36.670 --> 01:26:36.910] the
[01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:37.210] optimal
[01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:37.550] value
[01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.670] of
[01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:37.770] where
[01:26:37.770 --> 01:26:37.890] we
[01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:38.030] end
[01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.310] up
[01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:39.330] We
[01:26:39.330 --> 01:26:39.610] back
[01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:39.830] these
[01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:40.050] things
[01:26:40.050 --> 01:26:40.310] all
[01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.390] the
[01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.490] way
[01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:40.670] up.
[01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:40.790] And
[01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.910] that
[01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:41.150] tells
[01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:41.310] us
[01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.450] how
[01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.630] good
[01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:41.690] it
[01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:41.810] is
[01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:41.890] to
[01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:42.010] be
[01:26:42.010 --> 01:26:42.090] in
[01:26:42.090 --> 01:26:42.230] this
[01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:42.450] state
[01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:42.670] here.
[01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:43.790] So
[01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:44.030] that's
[01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.130] the
[01:26:44.130 --> 01:26:44.450] Bellman
[01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:45.250] optimality
[01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:46.210] equation
[01:26:46.210 --> 01:26:46.710] of
[01:26:46.710 --> 01:26:46.870] V
[01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:47.070] star.
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:51.940] Okay.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:57.120] So
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:57.520] finally,
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:57.740] just
[01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:57.920] before
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:58.000] we
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:58.080] give
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:58.220] one
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:26:58.660] last
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:26:59.080] example,
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:00.840] we
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:00.960] can
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.060] do
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:01.200] the
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:01.380] same
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:01.780] thing
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:02.300] flipping
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:02.500] the
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:02.760] diagram
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:03.160] around
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:03.300] and
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:03.640] starting
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:03.880] with
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:04.020] the

[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:04.640] values.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:04.860] And
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:05.340] this
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:05.460] is
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:05.640] to

[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:07.860] between

[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:08.640] values
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:08.780] and
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:09.120] themselves.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:09.920] So
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:10.060] this
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:10.260] isn't
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:10.440] really
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:10.680] saying
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:10.800] anything
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:11.240] different
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:11.380] to
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:11.480] the
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:11.700] previous
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:11.940] slide.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:12.100] It's
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:12.280] just
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:12.460] like
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:12.560] a
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:13.000] reordering
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:13.220] of
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:13.340] the
[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:13.600] same
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.520] idea.
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:15.120] And
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:15.200] the
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:15.580] reordering
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:15.880] tells
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:16.080] us
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:16.200] that
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:16.320] if
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:16.440] we
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:16.820] start
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:17.560] and
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:17.720] we
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:17.880] want
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:17.980] to
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:18.120] know
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:18.280] how
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:18.420] good
[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:18.520] is
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:18.640] one
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:18.720] of
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:18.860] these
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:19.380] arcs,
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.240] how
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:20.480] good
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:20.580] is
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:20.700] it
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:20.900] to
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:21.100] be
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:21.180] in
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:21.260] a
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:21.480] particular
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:21.780] state
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:21.900] and
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:22.060] take
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:22.160] a
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:22.380] particular
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:22.760] action?
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:23.860] Now,
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:24.160] we
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:24.480] first
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:24.600] of
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:24.720] all
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.040] consider
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:25.240] where
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:25.360] the
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:25.500] wind
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:25.620] will
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:25.820] blow
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:26.120] us.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:28.520] We
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:28.920] average
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.180] over
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:29.660] the
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:30.320] dice
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:30.540] which
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:30.660] the
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:31.120] environment's
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:31.340] rolling.
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:32.400] And
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:32.800] wherever
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:32.960] the
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.320] dice
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:33.640] roll,
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:34.020] we
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:34.180] get
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:34.300] to
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:34.460] make
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:34.560] a
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:34.880] decision.
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:35.860] So
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:36.140] wherever
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:36.560] the
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:36.780] wind
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:37.060] blows
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:37.300] us,
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:37.580] we
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:37.720] get
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:37.840] to
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.260] decide,
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:38.760] pick
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:38.960] one
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:39.200] action
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:39.460] after
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:39.780] that.
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:40.560] And
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:40.660] we
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:40.780] get
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:40.920] to
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:41.300] maximize
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:41.560] over
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:41.700] the
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:41.960] decisions
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.180] we
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:42.480] take.
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:43.520] So
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.100] we
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:44.420] average
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:44.700] over
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:45.060] the
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:45.260] dice
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:45.380] that
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:45.520] we
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:45.740] roll
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:45.940] and
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:46.080] we
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:46.400] maximize
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:46.720] over
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:46.860] the
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:47.100] decisions
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:47.300] we
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:47.600] take.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:48.220] And
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:48.340] for
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:48.540] each
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:48.640] of
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:48.800] these
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:49.120] leaves,
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:49.680] we
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.060] consider
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:50.680] the
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:50.940] action
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:51.260] value,
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:51.420] the
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:51.660] optimal
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:51.960] action
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:52.220] value,
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:52.420] like
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:52.600] how
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:52.800] good
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:52.920] is
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:53.060] it
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:53.180] to
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:53.440] be
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:53.940] in
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:54.120] this
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:54.400] state
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:54.840] taking
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.020] this
[01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:55.340] particular
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:55.660] action
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:56.020] or
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:56.140] in
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:56.260] this
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:56.460] state
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:56.740] taking
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:56.920] this
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.200] action?
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:57.920] We
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.160] back
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:58.360] that
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:58.580] up
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:27:58.800] all
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:27:58.920] the
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:27:59.140] way
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:27:59.400] to
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:27:59.480] the
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:27:59.720] beginning.
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:00.500] And
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:00.660] that
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:00.880] tells
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:01.000] us
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:01.120] the
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:01.260] Q
[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:01.480] value
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:01.620] of
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:01.740] the
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:01.880] root
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:02.000] of
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:02.140] this
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:02.440] diagram.
[01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:05.450] So
[01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.630] let's
[01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:05.810] make
[01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.970] that
[01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:06.430] concrete
[01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:07.370] by
[01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.630] picking
[01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:07.930] one
[01:28:07.930 --> 01:28:08.210] state
[01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:08.350] in
[01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.530] this
[01:28:08.530 --> 01:28:08.910] diagram,
[01:28:09.650 --> 01:28:10.170] probably
[01:28:10.170 --> 01:28:10.510] stick
[01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:11.310] to
[01:28:11.310 --> 01:28:11.850] the
[01:28:11.850 --> 01:28:12.090] teeth
[01:28:12.090 --> 01:28:12.230] of
[01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:12.430] this
[01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.930] student
[01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:13.270] MDP
[01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.510] by
[01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.750] now.
[01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:15.150] Anyway,
[01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.690] I
[01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:15.930] promise
[01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:16.090] it
[01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:16.310] won't
[01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.490] come
[01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:16.590] up
[01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:16.730] too
[01:28:16.730 --> 01:28:16.930] much
[01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:17.190] again.
[01:28:19.650 --> 01:28:20.170] So
[01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:20.690] here
[01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:20.850] we
[01:28:20.850 --> 01:28:21.110] start
[01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.270] off
[01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.410] in
[01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:21.570] this
[01:28:21.570 --> 01:28:21.890] state.
[01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:23.470] We
[01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:23.850] consider,
[01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:25.350] we
[01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.450] have
[01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:25.630] two
[01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:25.970] possible
[01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:26.290] actions
[01:28:26.290 --> 01:28:26.450] that
[01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.550] we
[01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.690] can
[01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:26.990] take.
[01:28:28.050 --> 01:28:28.570] So
[01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:28.750] this
[01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:29.070] one's
[01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.390] rather
[01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.850] straightforward.
[01:28:30.010 --> 01:28:30.130] There's
[01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:30.510] no
[01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:31.570] noise
[01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:31.770] that
[01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:32.070] in
[01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.170] the
[01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:32.430] environment,
[01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.630] we're
[01:28:32.630 --> 01:28:32.770] not
[01:28:32.770 --> 01:28:33.090] considering
[01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:33.390] any
[01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:33.770] dice
[01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:34.030] rolls.
[01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:34.250] It's
[01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.390] just
[01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.530] like
[01:28:34.530 --> 01:28:34.730] people
[01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:34.930] said
[01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:35.290] before,
[01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.910] implicitly
[01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:36.070] there's
[01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.270] like
[01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:36.490] a,
[01:28:37.150 --> 01:28:37.450] the
[01:28:37.450 --> 01:28:37.750] environment
[01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:38.310] always
[01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.570] rolls
[01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.570] the
[01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.570] dice
[01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:38.710] the
[01:28:38.710 --> 01:28:38.950] same
[01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:39.210] way
[01:28:39.210 --> 01:28:39.370] and
[01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:39.790] takes
[01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.950] us
[01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:40.150] here
[01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:40.310] if
[01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.390] we
[01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.570] take
[01:28:40.570 --> 01:28:40.730] this
[01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:41.030] action.
[01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:41.510] And
[01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.550] the
[01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:41.810] environment
[01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:42.190] always
[01:28:42.190 --> 01:28:42.390] rolls
[01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.530] the
[01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.710] dice
[01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:42.830] the
[01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.990] same
[01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:43.150] way
[01:28:43.150 --> 01:28:43.290] to
[01:28:43.290 --> 01:28:43.470] take
[01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.610] us
[01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:43.810] here.
[01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:44.510] So
[01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.610] we're
[01:28:44.610 --> 01:28:44.730] just
[01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:44.970] looking
[01:28:44.970 --> 01:28:45.190] ahead
[01:28:45.190 --> 01:28:45.430] one
[01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.730] step
[01:28:45.730 --> 01:28:46.190] by
[01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:46.430] saying
[01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.570] that
[01:28:46.570 --> 01:28:46.650] the
[01:28:46.650 --> 01:28:46.870] value
[01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.990] of
[01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:47.150] this
[01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:47.490] state,
[01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:48.090] six,
[01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:48.670] so
[01:28:48.670 --> 01:28:48.790] this
[01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.870] is
[01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:49.050] V
[01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:49.290] star
[01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:49.430] of
[01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.570] this
[01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:49.770] state,
[01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:50.150] six,
[01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:50.870] is
[01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:51.110] equal
[01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.430] to
[01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.870] the
[01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:52.230] max
[01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:53.270] of
[01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.450] all
[01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:53.550] the
[01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:53.730] things
[01:28:53.730 --> 01:28:53.870] we
[01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:54.010] can
[01:28:54.010 --> 01:28:54.210] do
[01:28:54.210 --> 01:28:54.510] here
[01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:56.690] of
[01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:57.050] the
[01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.290] value
[01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.630] function
[01:28:57.630 --> 01:28:57.790] of
[01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:57.910] where
[01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:58.030] we
[01:28:58.030 --> 01:28:58.190] end
[01:28:58.190 --> 01:28:58.390] up.
[01:28:58.890 --> 01:28:59.090] So
[01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.270] we
[01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.430] know
[01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.650] that
[01:28:59.650 --> 01:29:00.370] inductively,
[01:29:00.450 --> 01:29:00.510] if
[01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.590] we
[01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.830] assume
[01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.950] that
[01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:01.090] these
[01:29:01.090 --> 01:29:01.270] other
[01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.530] values
[01:29:01.530 --> 01:29:01.670] are
[01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:01.990] correct,
[01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.590] and
[01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.690] we
[01:29:02.690 --> 01:29:02.890] assume
[01:29:02.890 --> 01:29:03.030] that
[01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.190] this
[01:29:03.190 --> 01:29:03.330] has
[01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:03.530] an
[01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:03.750] optimal
[01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:04.010] value
[01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:04.130] of
[01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:04.390] six,
[01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:04.850] this
[01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:04.970] has
[01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:05.070] an
[01:29:05.070 --> 01:29:05.250] optimal
[01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:05.530] value
[01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:05.670] of
[01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:05.970] eight.
[01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:06.630] And
[01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:06.710] so
[01:29:06.710 --> 01:29:06.810] if
[01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:06.910] we
[01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:07.230] maximize
[01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:07.490] over
[01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.710] all
[01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:07.830] the
[01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.990] things
[01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.110] we
[01:29:08.110 --> 01:29:08.250] can
[01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:08.550] do,
[01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.930] we
[01:29:08.930 --> 01:29:09.090] see
[01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:09.270] that
[01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.530] that,
[01:29:14.170 --> 01:29:14.410] oh
[01:29:14.410 --> 01:29:14.510] yeah,
[01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.710] there's
[01:29:14.710 --> 01:29:14.790] a
[01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.950] minus
[01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:15.190] two
[01:29:15.190 --> 01:29:15.410] along
[01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:15.530] the
[01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:15.670] way
[01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:15.810] as
[01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:15.910] well.
[01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.110] That's
[01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:16.290] why
[01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:16.970] this
[01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:17.170] doesn't
[01:29:17.170 --> 01:29:17.330] work.
[01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.490] So
[01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:17.590] you
[01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.690] can
[01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:17.830] either
[01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.990] get
[01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.270] minus
[01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.710] one
[01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.910] followed
[01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:20.270] by
[01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:21.390] ending
[01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:21.550] up
[01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.630] in
[01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:21.710] a
[01:29:21.710 --> 01:29:21.870] state
[01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:22.010] with
[01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:22.330] six.
[01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:23.130] So
[01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:23.310] this
[01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:23.630] has
[01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:24.610] a
[01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:24.810] value
[01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:24.970] of
[01:29:24.970 --> 01:29:25.310] five.
[01:29:25.690 --> 01:29:25.910] If
[01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.990] we
[01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.170] take
[01:29:26.170 --> 01:29:26.370] this
[01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:26.650] arc,
[01:29:27.130 --> 01:29:27.250] so
[01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:27.470] Q
[01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.670] star
[01:29:27.670 --> 01:29:27.790] of
[01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.910] this
[01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:28.130] arc
[01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:28.250] is
[01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:28.590] five,
[01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.690] or
[01:29:29.690 --> 01:29:29.910] this
[01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:30.170] way,
[01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:30.510] we
[01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:30.630] get
[01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:30.910] minus
[01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:31.150] two
[01:29:31.150 --> 01:29:31.350] from
[01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.490] our
[01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.790] eight
[01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:32.290] and
[01:29:32.290 --> 01:29:32.370] we
[01:29:32.370 --> 01:29:32.530] get
[01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:32.910] six.
[01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:33.630] So
[01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:33.770] we
[01:29:33.770 --> 01:29:33.930] choose
[01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:34.030] to
[01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:34.130] go
[01:29:34.130 --> 01:29:34.330] this
[01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:34.550] way
[01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.770] and
[01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:34.890] our
[01:29:34.890 --> 01:29:35.070] value
[01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.330] function
[01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:35.490] is
[01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:35.770] six.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.160] So
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:40.640] how
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:40.760] do
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:40.840] we
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:41.040] solve
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:41.200] this
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:41.340] in
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:41.640] practice?
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:42.400] So
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:42.960] previously
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.240] we
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:43.420] saw
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:43.560] that
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:43.660] we
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:43.820] had
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:44.040] these
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:44.300] Bellman
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:44.700] equations
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:44.980] with
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:45.520] expectations
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.760] that
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:45.840] we
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:45.940] could
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:46.100] just
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:46.380] solve
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:46.560] by
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:46.760] doing
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:47.260] matrix
[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:47.580] inversion.
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:48.520] So
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:48.740] that's
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:48.920] very
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:49.240] appealing
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:49.440] for
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:49.620] those
[01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:49.720] of
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:49.800] you
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.020] like
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:50.500] MATLAB
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:50.620] and
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:50.760] these
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:51.000] nice
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.340] tools
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:51.540] where
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:51.640] you
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:51.720] can
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:51.880] just
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:53.480] type
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:53.600] in
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:53.700] your
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:53.960] matrix,
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:54.380] type
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:54.520] in
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:54.800] your
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.060] vector
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:56.500] representing
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:57.020] the
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:57.440] rewards
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:57.820] and
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:58.560] bam,
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:29:59.080] do
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:29:59.200] your
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:29:59.440] matrix
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:29:59.820] inversion,
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:00.000] you're
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:00.220] done.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:01.160] Unfortunately,
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:01.340] that
[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:01.540] doesn't
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:01.880] work
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:02.260] for
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:03.040] optimizing
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:03.340] the
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:03.620] Bellman
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:04.040] optimality
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:04.380] equation
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:04.620] because
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:04.760] we
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:04.880] have
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:05.000] these
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:05.400] nonlinear
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:05.900] equations
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:06.180] now.
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:07.860] We've
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:08.140] got
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:09.100] a

[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.060] in
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:10.300] addition
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:10.440] to
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:10.580] our
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:11.080] expectation
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:11.300] and
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:11.360] we
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:11.500] want
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:11.640] to
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:11.900] solve
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:12.080] for
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:12.340] this
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.040] equation
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:13.220] that
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:13.460] relates
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:13.700] V
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:13.900] star
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:14.060] to
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:14.360] itself
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:14.540] or

[01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:14.880] star
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:15.040] to
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:15.360] itself
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:15.580] with

[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:16.340] over
[01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:16.480] these
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.000] expectations.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:17.920] So
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:18.020] in
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:18.200] general,
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:18.360] there's
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:18.520] no

[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:19.160] to
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:19.340] this
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:19.540] thing
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:20.960] and
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.200] we
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:21.320] have
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:21.400] to
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:21.520] be

[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:22.580] And
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:22.720] how
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:22.820] do
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:22.880] we
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:23.000] be
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:23.260] smarter?
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:23.480] Well,
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:23.740] using
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:24.220] iterative

[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:26.560] best
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:26.720] known
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:27.220] examples
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:27.580] are

[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:31.180] which
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:31.280] we'll
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:31.480] talk

[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:32.420] class.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:33.400] These
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:33.500] are
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:33.860] dynamic
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:34.280] programming

[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:38.840] and

[01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:39.660] which
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:39.760] we'll
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:39.960] talk
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.120] about
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:40.240] in
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:40.360] our
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:40.640] subsequent
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.480] lecture.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:43.140] The
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:43.660] matrix
[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:44.080] solution
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:44.500] itself
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:44.660] is

[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:45.620] iterative
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:46.140] underneath.
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:46.680] You
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:46.820] don't
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:46.980] get
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:47.280] away
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:47.500] from
[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:47.840] doing
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:48.100] any
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:48.240] sort
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:48.320] of
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:48.660] iterative
[01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:49.260] calculation.
[01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:50.950] You
[01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:51.110] know,
[01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.290] to
[01:30:51.290 --> 01:30:51.530] solve
[01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:51.730] that
[01:30:51.730 --> 01:30:52.150] matrix
[01:30:52.150 --> 01:30:52.830] equation,
[01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:53.510] it's
[01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.690] an
[01:30:53.690 --> 01:30:53.990] order
[01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.130] of
[01:30:54.130 --> 01:30:54.390] magnitude
[01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.790] problem
[01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:55.030] where
[01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.130] you
[01:30:55.130 --> 01:30:55.410] have
[01:30:55.410 --> 01:30:55.570] to
[01:30:55.570 --> 01:30:56.270] iterate
[01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.530] in
[01:30:56.530 --> 01:30:56.710] some
[01:30:56.710 --> 01:30:56.990] sense
[01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:57.170] to
[01:30:57.170 --> 01:30:57.290] get
[01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:57.430] the
[01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.750] solution.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:30:59.640] Well,
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:30:59.760] I
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:30:59.920] mean,
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:00.320] there's
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.120] computation
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:01.600] required
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:01.860] to
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:02.120] solve
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:02.280] the
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:02.540] matrix
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:03.180] and
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:03.400] there's
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:03.740] steps
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:03.900] to
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:04.080] that
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:04.560] computation,
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:05.540] but
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:05.720] it's
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:05.940] not.
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:07.040] So
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:07.440] by
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:07.920] iterative
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:08.300] solution
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:08.620] method,
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:08.760] we
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:08.960] mean
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:09.240] something
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:09.540] more
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:09.920] like
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:10.400] where
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:10.540] you
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:10.820] have
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:11.640] an
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.020] equation
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:12.360] which
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:12.680] you
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.360] iteratively
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.420] apply
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:14.940] at
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:15.120] each
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:15.360] step,
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:15.480] you
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:15.860] apply
[01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:16.080] it
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:16.300] to
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:16.360] the
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:16.520] next
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:16.740] step
[01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:16.840] of
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:17.020] that
[01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:17.440] update.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:17.620] So
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:17.720] you
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:17.900] start
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:18.040] with
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:18.220] some
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:18.540] estimate,
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:19.140] you
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:19.420] update
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:19.580] your
[01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:19.820] estimate
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:20.080] towards
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:20.200] a
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:20.320] new
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:20.560] estimate
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:20.680] and
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:20.820] so
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:21.020] forth.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:21.480] Now,
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:21.640] of
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:21.700] course,
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:21.880] there
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:22.080] are
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:22.360] iterative
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:22.780] approaches
[01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:22.980] to
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:23.300] matrix
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:23.680] inversion
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:24.040] like
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:24.140] the
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:24.300] Sherman
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:24.660]-Morrison
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:25.200] trick,
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:25.420] which
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:26.000] can
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:26.140] be
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:26.440] applied
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:26.740] to
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:27.400] reinforcement
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:28.040] learning
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:28.280] as
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:28.520] well.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:29.160] And
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:29.240] so
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:29.400] there
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:29.600] are
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:29.880] cases
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:30.060] where
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:30.180] the
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:30.420] matrix
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:30.820] inversion
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:31.060] can
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:31.520] be
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.200] reduced
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:32.380] in
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:32.820] complexity
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.240] from
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:33.880] n
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:34.120] cubed
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:34.260] to
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:34.420] n
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:34.760] squared.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:35.400] Those
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:35.500] are
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:35.740] special
[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:36.240] cases.
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:36.680] And
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:36.740] so
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:36.820] I'm
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:37.020] talking
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:37.160] about
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:37.280] the
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:37.600] general
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.540] approach
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:38.780] here.
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:39.380] So
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:40.580] yes
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:40.740] and
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:40.920] no.
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:44.260] OK,
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:45.220] so
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.980] we're
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:47.860] just
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:48.080] about
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:48.300] out
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:48.380] of
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:48.680] time.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:49.460] I
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:49.700] think
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:49.820] I
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:49.980] want
[01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:50.120] to
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:51.080] really
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:51.280] just
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:51.480] take
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:51.840] questions
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:51.960] and
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:52.100] make
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:52.220] sure
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:52.460] people
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:52.620] are
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:53.060] following
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:53.340] rather
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:53.500] than
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:53.700] going
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:53.900] into
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:54.060] the
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:54.400] extensions
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:54.620] in
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:54.760] any
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:54.940] great
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:55.240] detail.
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:57.720] So
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:31:58.200] this
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:58.300] is
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:31:58.380] a
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:31:58.520] great
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:31:58.760] time
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:31:58.880] if
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:31:58.960] you
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:31:59.200] feel
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:31:59.420] that
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:31:59.800] something
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.020] was
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:00.440] unclear
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:01.320] and
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:01.980] now's
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:02.060] your
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:02.400] chance
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:02.640] to
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.700] ask.
[01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:06.220] Otherwise,
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:06.400] I'm
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:06.500] just
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:06.600] going
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:06.600] to
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:06.880] assume
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:07.060] that
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:08.380] all
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:08.660] the
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:09.180] notes
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:09.420] were
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.240] incredibly
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:10.700] perfectly
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:10.960] clear
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:11.100] and
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:11.300] everyone
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:11.620] understood
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:11.940] everything,
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:12.200] which
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:12.440] I'm
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:12.700] fairly
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:13.380] confident
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:13.540] is
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:13.720] not
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:13.880] true.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:14.260] Yes,
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:14.460] please.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:32.820] OK,
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:33.020] so
[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:33.100] it's
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:33.180] a
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:33.320] great
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:33.600] question.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:33.740] So
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:33.840] the
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:34.060] question
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:34.340] is,
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:34.580] you
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:34.720] know,
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:34.900] in
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:35.460] reality,
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:37.020] the
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:37.280] MDP
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:37.500] is
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:37.660] just
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:37.800] a
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:38.040] model.
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:38.780] We're
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:38.900] trying
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:39.080] to
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:39.260] model
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:39.540] some
[01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:39.940] real
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:40.380] phenomenon
[01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:41.060] out
[01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:41.160] in
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:41.260] the
[01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:41.420] world,
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:41.620] some
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:41.800] real
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.200] environment.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:43.520] How
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:43.640] do
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:43.760] we
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.060] represent
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:44.280] the
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:44.480] fact
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:44.660] that
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:44.860] our
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:45.080] model
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:45.280] is
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:45.780] imperfect?
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:47.200] We're
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:47.400] actually
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:47.560] going
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:47.600] to
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:47.700] have
[01:32:47.700 --> 01:32:47.820] a
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:48.140] class
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:48.420] on
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:49.580] where
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:49.720] we'll
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:49.960] talk
[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:50.140] about
[01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:50.400] model
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:50.680]-based
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:51.140] reinforcement
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:51.520] learning.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:52.160] If
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:52.300] there's
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:52.640] time,
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:52.800] I'll
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.000] talk
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:53.180] about
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:53.380] some
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:53.460] of
[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:53.520] the
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:53.840] approaches
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:54.140] to
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:54.760] uncertainty.
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:56.140] So
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:56.320] some
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:56.400] of
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:56.480] the
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:56.800] classical
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.200] approaches
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:57.380] to
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:57.860] uncertainty
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:59.040] include
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.000] explicitly
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:00.520] representing
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:00.680] the
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:01.080] uncertainty
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:01.280] in
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:01.380] the
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:01.640] MDP.
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:02.860] So
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:02.940] you
[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:03.080] could
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:03.280] be
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:03.680] Bayesian,
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:03.880] for
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:04.140] example,
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:04.460] have
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:05.040] some
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.180] posterior
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:06.800] estimate
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:06.980] of
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:07.120] what
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:07.400] the
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:07.760] MDP
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.180] dynamics
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:08.480] are
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:08.640] and
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:08.820] then
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:09.080] solve
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:09.700] not
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:09.960] just
[01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:10.460] one
[01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:11.340] single
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:11.640] MDP,
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:11.940] but
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:12.160] a
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:12.340] whole
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:12.800] distribution
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.020] over
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:13.600] MDPs
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.040] and
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:14.240] find
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:14.380] the
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:14.660] policy
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:14.900] that's
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:15.180] optimal
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:15.400] with
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:15.580] respect
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:15.700] to
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:15.840] all
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:15.940] of
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:16.200] them.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:17.200] That's
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:17.780] computationally
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:17.960] very
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:18.340] difficult.
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:19.140] Another
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:19.620] approach
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:19.780] is
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:19.900] to
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:20.160] actually
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:20.660] factor
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:20.960] in
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:21.160] the
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:21.720] uncertainty
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:22.120] in
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:22.220] your
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:22.640] representation
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:23.040] of
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:23.520] what's
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:23.640] going
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:23.760] on
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:23.840] in
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:23.880] the
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:24.060] world
[01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:24.520] into
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:24.780] your
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:25.040] MDP
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:25.500] itself.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:26.220] So
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:26.360] you'll
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:26.480] say
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:26.700] you're
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:26.920] in
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:27.080] a
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:27.420] state
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:28.160] where
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:28.500] not
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:28.740] only
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:28.860] am
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:28.940] I
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:29.040] in
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:29.140] a
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:29.300] state
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:29.420] where
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:29.560] my
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:29.920] robot's
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:30.140] here,
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:30.760] but
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:30.860] I'm
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:30.960] in
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:31.260] a
[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:31.560] state
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:31.840] where
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:32.200] my
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:32.580] robot's
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:32.880] here
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:33.060] and
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:33.200] I
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:33.540] think
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:33.700] that
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:33.840] the
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:34.060] world
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:34.300] has
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:34.500] these
[01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:34.960] dynamics,
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:36.320] or
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:36.600] I'm
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:36.680] in
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:36.800] a
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:36.960] state
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:37.080] where
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:37.160] the
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:37.480] robot's
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:37.720] here
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:37.840] and
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:38.840] I've
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:39.060] seen
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:39.260] these
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:39.700] observations
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:40.000] so
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:40.180] far,
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:40.380] which
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:40.840] implicitly
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:41.020] tell
[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:41.160] me
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:41.380] something
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:41.660] about
[01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:41.820] the
[01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:42.220] uncertainty
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:42.600] of
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:43.100] what's
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:43.280] going
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:43.740] on
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:43.980] in
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:44.080] the
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:44.340] MDP.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.000] So
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:46.340] that
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:46.720] can
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:46.880] be
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:47.080] much
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:47.260] more
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:47.660] tractable.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:47.900] You
[01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:48.080] don't
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:48.440] necessarily
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:48.620] need
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:48.740] to
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:49.120] explicitly
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:49.440] reason
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:49.680] about
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:49.840] all
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:49.940] the
[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:50.380] uncertainty
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:50.540] in
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:50.620] the
[01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:50.920] environment,
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:52.400] but
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:52.760] it's
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:52.980] maybe
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:53.120] a
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:53.240] little
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:53.560] less
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:54.120] intuitive
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:54.380] to
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:54.940] understand
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:55.320] the
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:55.880] form
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.000] of
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:56.080] the
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:56.480] uncertainty.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:56.720] The
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:57.020] uncertainty
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:57.300] isn't
[01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:57.520] made
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:57.860] explicit.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:33:59.400] And
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:33:59.500] then
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:33:59.640] maybe
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:33:59.760] the
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:33:59.880] only
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:00.080] other
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:00.240] thing
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:00.340] to
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:00.520] say,
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:00.680] which
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:00.760] we
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:00.940] already
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:01.260] touched
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:01.480] on,
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:01.600] is
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:01.780] that
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:02.280] sometimes
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:02.820] it's
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:03.180] sufficient
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:03.400] to
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:03.700] just
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:04.880] say,
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:05.200] well,
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:06.060] except
[01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:06.300] that
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:06.420] the
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:06.620] world
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:06.800] is,
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:07.200] our
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:07.420] model
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:07.540] is
[01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:07.880] imperfect
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:08.420] and
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:08.560] use
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:08.660] a
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:08.900] discount
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:09.240] factor
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:09.560] to
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:10.040] capture
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:10.220] the
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:10.400] fact
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:10.560] that
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:10.720] we've
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:10.900] got
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:11.140] some
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:11.600] uncertainty.
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:12.280] You
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:12.400] can
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:12.580] also
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:12.780] make
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:12.900] the
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:13.640] discount
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:13.980] factor
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.420] variable
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:15.180] to
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:15.680] represent
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:15.880] the
[01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:16.040] fact
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:16.180] that
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:16.340] you're
[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:16.560] more
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:16.940] uncertain
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:17.080] in
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:17.280] some
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:17.540] states
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:17.700] than
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:17.940] others.
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:18.360] So
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:18.420] you
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:18.560] don't
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:18.740] have
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:18.800] to
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:18.920] have
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:19.100] 0
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:19.320].9
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:19.660] everywhere.
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:19.860] You
[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:20.000] could
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:20.240] have
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:20.940] 0
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:21.240].9
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:21.400] in
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:21.700] one
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:21.940] state,
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:22.160] 0
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:22.460].99
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:22.680] in
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:22.920] another
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:23.220] state,
[01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:23.940] representing
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:24.280] how
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:25.100] bad
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:25.240] your
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:25.420] model
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:25.580] is
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:25.680] in
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:25.820] that
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:26.260] situation.
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:27.440] So
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:27.840] it's
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:27.920] a
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.080] very
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:28.340] active
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:28.700] research
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:28.920] area.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:29.040] I
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:29.120] think
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:29.200] it's
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:29.260] a
[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:29.360] great
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:29.660] question.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:32.600] So
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:33.000] everything
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:33.240] we've
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:33.860] shown
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:34.200] us
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:34.760] since
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.240] today
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:35.540] seems
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:35.780] to
[01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:36.300] sort
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:37.120] of
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:37.540] get
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:38.000] towards
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.320] maximizing
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:39.960] reward.
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:41.620] But
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:42.100] is
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:42.240] there
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.180] anything
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.000] implicit
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:44.340] in
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:44.540] there
[01:34:44.540 --> 01:34:44.700] that
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:44.860] would
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:45.300] also
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:45.640] like
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:46.800] have
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:46.920] a
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:47.360] consideration
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:47.680] of
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:47.960] risk?
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:48.180] So
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:48.480] like
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.220] if
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:49.560] you,
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:50.660] you
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:50.860] know,
[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:51.560] I
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:51.680] mean,
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:51.780] you
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:52.000] might
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:52.760] be
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:53.140] interested
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:53.400] in
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.020] maximizing
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:54.240] your
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:54.560] reward
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:54.700] at
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:34:54.820] a
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:55.020] future
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:55.340] time
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:55.460] and
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:55.680] choosing
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:55.920] that
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.380] policy,
[01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:56.760] but
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.660] there
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:57.820] might
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:57.960] be
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:58.140] some
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:58.460] chance
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:34:58.600] of
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:34:58.860] choosing
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:34:59.100] that
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:34:59.500] policy,
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:00.860] you
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:01.000] know,
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:01.160] that
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.040] there's
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:02.360] also
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:03.520] an
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:03.900] increased
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:04.340] risk.
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:05.960] Okay,
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:06.400] so
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.020] the
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:07.240] question
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:07.440] is,
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.080] everything's
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:08.260] just
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:08.500] talking
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:08.700] about
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:09.180] maximizing
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:09.620] reward
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:10.020] and
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:10.660] expectations
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:10.840] of
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:11.000] those
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:11.260] reward
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:11.560] without
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:12.040] explicitly
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:12.560] considering
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.020] risk
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:13.200] or
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:13.560] variance
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:13.820] of
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.520] those
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.080] returns.
[01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:16.780] So
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:17.300] I
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:17.400] think
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:17.540] the
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:17.800] correct
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:18.060] answer
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:18.220] to
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:18.440] that
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:18.880] is
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:19.000] to
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:19.180] say
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:19.360] that
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:19.480] you
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:19.620] can
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:20.020] always
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:20.680] transform
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:21.220] any
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:21.620] MDP
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:23.160] with
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:23.420] no
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:23.760] risk
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.440] into,
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:24.880] so
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:25.120] if
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:25.260] there's
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:25.420] some
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:25.680] amount
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:25.820] that
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:25.920] you
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.100] care
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:26.280] about
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:26.460] your
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:26.740] risk,
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:27.100] like
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:27.320] let's
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:27.440] say
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:27.560] that
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:27.700] there's
[01:35:27.700 --> 01:35:27.800] a
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.120] cost
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:28.620] that
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:28.960] depends
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:29.560] on
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.040] the
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:30.300] variance
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:30.560] of
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:30.800] your
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.100] returns.
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:32.820] There
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:32.920] is
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.200] another
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:33.620] MDP
[01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:34.320] which
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:34.780] has
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:34.900] a
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:35.160] different
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:35.460] reward
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:35.860] function
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.540] that
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:36.880] already
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:37.240] factors
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:37.640] in
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:38.640] the
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.000] variance
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:39.140] of
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:39.300] those
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.120] rewards
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:40.480] into
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:40.660] the
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:40.920] actual
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.220] reward
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:41.360] that
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:41.460] you
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:41.600] see
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:41.700] at
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:41.780] the
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:41.880] end
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:41.960] of
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:42.060] your
[01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:42.460] trajectory.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:43.540] So
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:43.680] that
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:43.860] can
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:44.020] be
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:44.420] implicit
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:44.740] in
[01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:45.300] this
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:46.180] model
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:46.420] you've
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:46.600] shown
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:46.780] us
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:47.000] today,
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:47.320] basically.
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:47.800] So
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:47.960] there
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:48.140] is
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:48.240] a
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:48.620] transformation
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:48.900] of
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:49.300] any
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:49.760] risk
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:50.080] sensitive
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:50.400] MDP
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:50.880] into
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:51.180] another
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:51.480] MDP.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:52.120] However,
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:52.640] that
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.160] transformation
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:54.020] can
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:54.160] be
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:54.360] quite
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:54.800] complex.
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.060] So
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:55.160] you
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:55.300] might
[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:55.480] need
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:55.600] to
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:55.860] remember
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:56.140] all
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:56.240] the
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:56.400] things
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:56.520] that
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:56.620] you've
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:56.760] seen
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:56.960] so
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:57.240] far,
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:57.380] and
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:57.480] it
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:57.580] can
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:58.540] be
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:35:58.620] a
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:35:58.760] more
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:35:59.260] complicated
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:35:59.640] MDP
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:35:59.880] that
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:35:59.940] you
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:00.060] end
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:00.140] up
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:00.320] having
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:00.500] to
[01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:00.720] solve.
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:01.520] So
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:01.680] that's
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:01.800] the
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.020] first
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:02.380] answer.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:03.200] The
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:03.420] second
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:03.660] answer
[01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:03.780] is
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:03.860] to
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:04.020] say
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:04.280] that,
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:04.440] you
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:04.480] know,
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:04.620] a
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:04.720] bunch
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:04.820] of
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:05.060] people
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:05.440] do
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:06.060] specifically
[01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:06.480] consider
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:06.760] risk
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.080] sensitive
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:07.660] MDPs
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:07.780] where
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:07.900] you
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:08.060] don't
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:08.320] just
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:08.980] consider
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:09.540] expectations,
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:09.740] but
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:09.820] you
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:10.160] consider,
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:10.340] you
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:10.400] know,
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:10.580] what's
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:10.680] the
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:10.940] variance
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:11.100] of
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:11.380] those
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:11.900] rewards
[01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:12.040] at
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:12.140] the
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:12.200] end
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:12.300] of
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:12.380] the
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:12.580] day.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:14.240] So
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:14.600] there's
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:14.940] a
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:16.020] bunch
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:16.160] of
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:16.440] work
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:16.900] out
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:17.120] there,
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:17.380] and
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:17.720] I'm
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:17.880] happy
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:18.140] to
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:18.460] give
[01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:18.560] you
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:18.800] pointers
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:18.980] to
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:19.140] that
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:19.280] if
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:19.460] you're
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:19.920] interested.
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:21.460] Any
[01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:21.620] other
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:21.980] questions?
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:25.020] Okay,
[01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:25.180] one
[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:25.340] more,
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:25.420] and
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:25.500] then
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:25.580] I
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:25.700] just
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:25.800] want
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:25.860] to
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:25.960] say
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:26.060] a
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:26.220] couple
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:26.340] of
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:26.520] words
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:26.760] before
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:27.080] everyone
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:27.460] piles
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:27.640] up.
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:27.860] Oh,
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.000] yeah.
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:28.280] Sorry,
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:28.520] this
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:28.680] guy
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:28.820] was
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:29.000] actually
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:29.560] waiting
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:29.860] for
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:30.060] longer.
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:32.620] Okay,
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:56.080] so
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:56.340] the
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:56.580] question
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:56.720] is,
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:36:56.900] what's
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:57.000] the
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:57.360] intuition
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:57.680] behind
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:57.840] the
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:58.020] Bellman
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:58.340] equation
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:58.840] in
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:36:59.080] some
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:36:59.340] real
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:36:59.760] example?
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:00.860] So
[01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:00.960] if
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:01.040] we
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:01.180] take
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:01.280] the
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:01.580] Atari
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:02.160] game
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:02.280] as
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:02.400] an
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:02.720] example,
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:04.580] so
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:04.920] the
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.140] Bellman
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:05.740] optimality
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:06.100] equation,
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:06.300] let's
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:06.500] focus
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:06.620] on
[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:06.740] that
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:06.880] one.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:07.080] That's
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:07.300] the,
[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:07.580] you
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:07.620] know,
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:07.760] the
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:07.980] crux
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:08.100] of
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:08.200] where
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:08.300] we
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:08.460] got
[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:08.680] to.
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:10.080] The
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:10.420] Q
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:10.760] star
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:11.500] or
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:11.720] V
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:11.960] star
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.080] is
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:12.280] telling
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:12.480] you,
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:12.640] you
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:12.700] know,
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:12.900] what's
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:13.000] the
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:13.300] maximum
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:13.460] amount
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:13.560] of
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:13.740] score
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:13.900] you
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:14.020] can
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:14.220] get?
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:14.560] You
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:14.600] know,
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:14.760] you're
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:14.880] in
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.040] this
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:15.280] screen
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:15.560] here.
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:16.380] What's
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:16.500] the
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:16.760] maximum
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:17.100] score
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:17.240] you
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:17.340] can
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:17.480] get
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:17.620] from
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:17.780] this
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:18.000] screen
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:18.240] here?
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:19.040] And
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:19.140] the
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:19.440] intuition
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:19.780] is
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:20.060] that
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:20.540] all
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:20.640] you
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:20.780] need
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:20.900] to
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:21.160] do
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:21.440] to
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:21.600] get
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:21.760] that
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.020] maximum
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:22.440] score,
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:22.940] this
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:23.060] is
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:23.140] called
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:23.280] the
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:23.480] principle
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:23.640] of
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.100] optimality.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:24.280] So
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:24.380] the
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:24.600] principle
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:24.760] of
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:25.160] optimality
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:25.480] tells
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:25.680] you
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.060] that

[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:27.420] score
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:27.920] is
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.060] to
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:28.320] behave
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:28.780] optimally

[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:29.520] step
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:30.020] and
[01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:30.140] then

[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:31.420] of
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:31.520] your
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:31.880] trajectory.
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:32.940] OK,
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:33.660] if
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:33.720] you
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.040] behave

[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:34.920] of
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:35.040] your

[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:36.060] that's
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:36.160] the

[01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:38.060] in.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:38.740] And
[01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:38.800] so
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:38.980] now
[01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:39.200] all
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:39.300] you
[01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:39.440] need
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:39.540] to

[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:40.720] out,
[01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:40.840] well,
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:40.940] how
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:41.040] do
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:41.140] I

[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:43.020] And
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:43.080] the

[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:43.280] that
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:43.360] you
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:43.580] behave
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:43.880] optimally
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:44.040] for
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:44.240] one
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:44.480] step
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:44.700] is
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:44.880] to
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:45.300] maximize
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:45.920] over
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:47.240] those
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:47.520] optimal
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:47.780] value
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:48.120] functions
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:48.240] in
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:48.320] the
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:48.520] places
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:48.680] you
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:48.820] might
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:48.980] end
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:49.140] up
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:49.300] in.
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:49.980] So
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:50.100] it's
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:50.240] like
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:50.400] you
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:50.620] might
[01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:50.980] move
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:51.200] your,
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:51.860] you
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:52.040] might
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:52.220] move
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:52.440] Pac
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:52.580]-Man
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:52.740] to

[01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:53.120] left
[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:54.820] and
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:54.940] you
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:55.060] might
[01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:55.220] move
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:55.420] Pac

[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:55.620] to
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:55.740] the
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:55.980] right.
[01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:56.780] If
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:56.840] you
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:57.020] move
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:57.220] Pac

[01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:57.480] to
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:57.600] the
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:57.880] right
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:58.400] and
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:37:58.800] you
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:37:58.940] can
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:37:59.120] get
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:37:59.400] 100
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:37:59.760] points
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.020] of
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:01.200] optimal

[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:01.660] from
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:01.800] that
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:01.980] point
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:02.240] onwards,
[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:03.180] or
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:03.620] so
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:04.020] moving
[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:04.140] to
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:04.240] the
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:04.400] right,
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:04.520] you
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:04.680] might
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:04.840] get
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:05.060] plus
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:05.340] 10
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:06.080] and
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:06.200] then
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:06.460] 100
[01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:06.800] points
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:07.000] of
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:07.360] optimal
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:07.640] value
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:08.080] afterwards.
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.060] Moving
[01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:09.200] to
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:09.320] the
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:09.500] left,
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:09.620] you
[01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:09.780] might
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:09.940] get
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:10.160] plus
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:10.620] 20,
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:11.480] but
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:11.800] then
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.220] only
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:12.500] 50
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:12.760] points

[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:13.820] afterwards.
[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:14.260] And
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:14.340] so
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:14.480] the
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:14.800] intuition
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:15.100] is
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:15.360] that
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.100] just
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:16.420] by
[01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:17.520] breaking
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:17.820] down
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:18.000] your
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:18.400] trajectory
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:18.600] into
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:18.780] these
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:18.960] two
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:19.280] paths,
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:19.440] into
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:19.560] the
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:19.820] optimal
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:20.180] decision
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:20.340] at
[01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:20.540] one
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:20.780] step
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:20.940] and
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:21.040] the
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:21.240] optimal
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:21.580] decision
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:21.800] from
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:21.960] there
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:22.280] onwards,
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:22.780] you
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:22.920] can
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:23.560] describe
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:23.880] what
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:23.980] it
[01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:24.140] means
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:24.240] to
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:24.340] have
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:24.600] optimal
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:24.980] dynamics
[01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:25.140] for
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:25.180] the
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:25.280] whole
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:25.580] problem.
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:27.300] OK,
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.040] one
[01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:28.180] more
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:28.420] question
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:28.540] and
[01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:28.640] I
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:28.800] just
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:28.940] want
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:29.100] to
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:29.380] say
[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:29.500] a
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:29.600] couple
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:29.720] of
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:29.900] words
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:30.120] about
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:30.260] the
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:30.660] extensions
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:31.060] without
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:31.380] any
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:31.760] details
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:31.920] at
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:32.080] all.
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:32.180] So
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:32.800] don't
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:33.000] get
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:33.280] scared.
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:34.440] Yes.
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:46.500] So
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:46.860] if
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:46.940] you
[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:47.040] have
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:47.140] a
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:47.280] million
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:47.620] states
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:47.760] and
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:47.840] a
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:47.980] million
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:48.420] actions
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:48.620] per
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:48.880] state,
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:49.020] you
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:49.160] have
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:49.260] a
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:49.520] large
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:49.840] MDP.
[01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:50.500] And
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:50.600] so
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:50.820] now
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:50.960] you're
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:51.160] asking
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:51.380] how
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:51.500] do
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:51.740] you
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:52.180] actually
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:52.520] solve
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:52.640] the
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:52.960] MDP
[01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:53.780] to
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:54.140] find
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:54.280] the
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:54.520] optimal
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:54.760] value
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:55.080] function?
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:55.860] Is
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:55.940] that
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:56.040] the
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:56.300] question?
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:57.160] Was
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:57.260] the
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:38:57.460] question
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:38:57.600] how
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:57.700] do
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:57.760] you
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:57.960] solve
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.060] it
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:38:58.160] or
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:58.320] how
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:58.420] do
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:38:58.480] you
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:58.760] decide
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:58.880] on
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:38:58.960] the
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:38:59.180] immediate
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:38:59.620] rewards?
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:05.640] I
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:05.860] see.
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:06.200] So
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:06.320] the
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:06.540] question
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:06.860] isn't
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:06.980] how
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:07.080] do
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:07.160] you
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:07.380] solve
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:07.500] the
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:07.740] MDP,
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:07.980] it's
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:08.120] how
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:08.240] do
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:08.400] you
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:08.920] model
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:09.100] the
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:09.360] MDP?
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:09.620] How
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:09.720] do
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:10.020] you
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:10.620] represent
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:10.880] a
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:11.080] large
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:11.320] MDP?
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:11.920] So
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:12.220] typically
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:12.360] the
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:12.620] reward
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:12.960] function
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:13.240] is
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:13.780] given
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:14.100] by
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:14.420] the
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:15.580] environment
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:16.160] dynamics.
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:16.900] So
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:17.000] it's
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:17.180] given
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:17.540] by,
[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:18.740] so
[01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:18.940] for
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:19.200] example,
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:19.380] it
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:19.580] might
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:19.900] be,
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:20.320] you
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:20.380] know,
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:20.580] imagine
[01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:20.740] you're
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:20.940] playing
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:21.320] Atari.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:22.080] The
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:22.360] score
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:22.520] that
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:22.620] you
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:22.840] get,
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:23.020] there
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:23.220] are
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:23.660] many
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:23.860] more
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:23.980] than
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:24.080] a
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:24.220] million
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:24.640] states
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:25.000] in
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:25.300] Atari.
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.140] And
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:26.380] yet
[01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:26.760] the
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:27.020] score
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:27.160] is
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:27.320] just
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:27.460] a
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:27.700] function
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:27.920] of
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:28.060] that
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:28.300] state
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:28.420] that
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:28.560] you're
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:28.720] in.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:29.140] So
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:29.240] it's
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:29.440] something
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:29.740] which,
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:30.040] you
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:30.100] know,
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:30.300] you're
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:30.420] in
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:30.560] this
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:30.740] state,
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:30.920] you
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:31.100] query
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:31.260] the
[01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:31.620] emulator,
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:31.800] you
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:31.920] say
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:32.140] what's
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:32.260] the
[01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:32.460] score
[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:32.600] or
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:32.700] you
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:33.020] extract
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:33.220] the
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:33.420] score
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:33.620] from
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:33.780] the
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.060] screen.
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:34.600] And
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:34.720] it's
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:34.880] just
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:35.040] a
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:35.300] function
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:35.500] that
[01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:35.840] depends
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:36.000] on
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:36.140] your
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:36.420] state.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:37.160] So
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:37.440] typically
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:37.680] there's
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:37.820] some
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:38.260] function
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:38.540] mapping
[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:38.880] state
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.080] to
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:39.400] reward
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:39.940] and
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:40.120] that
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:40.500] function
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:41.300] characterizes
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:41.880] like
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:42.080] the,
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:42.540] this
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:42.660] is
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:42.900] like,
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:43.140] you
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:43.160] know,
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:43.460] imagine
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:43.620] you're
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:43.740] a
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:44.020] programmer
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:44.180] and
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:44.280] you're
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:44.420] trying
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:44.580] to
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:44.940] tell
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:45.080] your
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:45.540] program
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:46.140] how
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:46.420] to,
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:46.920] what
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:47.300] the
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:47.500] problem
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:47.640] is
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:47.760] you're
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:47.900] trying
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:48.040] to
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:48.280] solve.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:48.460] The
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:48.700] reward
[01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:48.980] function
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:49.120] is
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:49.320] kind
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:49.420] of
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:49.600] like
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:49.900] the
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:50.220] definition
[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:50.400] of
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:50.760] the
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:51.180] program.
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:52.240] You're
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:52.640] asking
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:52.820] the
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.040] program
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:53.220] to
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:53.620] solve
[01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:54.240] this
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:54.540] particular
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:54.900] problem.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:55.080] It's
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:55.300] part
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:55.400] of
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:55.500] the
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:55.680] problem
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:56.100] definition.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:57.280] So
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:57.680] the
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:39:58.000] reward
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:58.360] is
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:39:58.540] just
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:39:58.720] a
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:39:59.020] function
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:39:59.260] of,
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:00.260] it's
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:00.480] part
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:00.580] of
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:00.640] the
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:00.960] environment.
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:01.100] It's
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:01.260] part
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:01.380] of
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:01.440] the
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:01.540] thing
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:02.060] describing
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:03.220] how
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:03.340] the
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:03.640] environment
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:03.920] state
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:04.120] gets
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:04.300] mapped
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:04.500] into
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:04.800] reward.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:05.380] So
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:05.500] in
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:05.660] any
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:05.920] reasonable
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:06.320] problem,
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:06.840] you'll
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:07.000] see
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:07.120] that
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:07.260] there's
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:07.340] a
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:07.460] way
[01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:07.580] to
[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:07.920] transform
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:08.220] this
[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:08.420] and
[01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:08.900] describe
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:09.060] the
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:09.280] reward
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:09.820] normally
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:10.080] quite
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:10.520] conveniently.
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:11.260] There's
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:11.360] a
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:11.540] big
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:11.900] open
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:12.460] question,
[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:12.680] which
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:12.800] is
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:12.940] how
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:13.080] do
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:13.180] you
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:13.420] best
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:13.700] model
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:13.820] the
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:14.080] reward
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:14.220] in
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:14.300] the
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:14.460] way
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:14.600] that
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:14.900] actually
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:15.180] leads
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:15.380] to
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:15.920] intuitively
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:16.180] what
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:16.320] we
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:16.440] as
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:16.680] humans
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:16.920] think
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:17.020] of
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:17.140] as
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:17.240] the
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:17.400] best
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:17.720] solution.
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:19.440] Yeah.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:20.160] Okay.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:20.380] Very
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:20.660] briefly,
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:20.800] I
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:20.920] just
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:21.100] wanted
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:21.560] to
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:21.980] put
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:22.160] up
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:22.380] this
[01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:23.880] slide
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:24.120] just
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:24.300] to
[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:24.640] highlight
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:24.820] that
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:24.980] there
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:25.140] are
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:25.300] some
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:25.600] additional
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:26.140] slides,
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:26.980] extensions
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:27.220] to
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:27.620] MVPs.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:28.220] This
[01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:28.380] is
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:28.600] not
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:29.060] examinable
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:29.440] material.
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:29.640] I
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:29.780] do
[01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:29.980] not
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:30.360] expect
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:30.500] you
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:30.700] guys
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:30.820] to
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:30.960] go
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.120] off
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:31.220] and
[01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:31.520] revise
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:31.760] stuff,
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:31.920] which
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:32.000] I
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:32.220] haven't
[01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:32.540] exactly,
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:32.740] which
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:32.800] I
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:32.980] haven't
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.180] told
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:33.280] you
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:33.540] about.
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:34.220] And
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:34.340] in
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:34.620] general
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:34.800] for
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:34.960] these
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:35.340] classes,
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:35.820] I'll
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:35.960] try
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:36.080] to
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:36.220] make
[01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:36.300] it
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:36.460] very
[01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:36.760] clear
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:37.040] what's
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:37.220] not
[01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:37.640] examinable
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:38.040] material.
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:38.480] And
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:38.560] if
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:38.660] we
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:38.800] run
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:38.920] out
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:39.060] of
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:39.240] time
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:39.360] at
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:39.500] any
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:39.720] point,
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:40.140] don't
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:40.640] panic.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:41.100] You
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:41.180] know,
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:41.980] you
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:42.320] won't
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:42.580] suddenly
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:42.820] find
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:42.920] a
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:43.180] question
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:43.300] that
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:43.600] crop
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:43.780] up
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:43.880] in
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:43.980] the
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:44.220] exam,
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:44.440] which
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:44.760] we
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.240] didn't
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:45.520] cover.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:46.960] But
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:47.120] the
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:47.480] extensions
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:47.700] are
[01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:47.800] on
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:47.920] the
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:48.240] slides
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:48.460] just
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:48.640] there
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:48.740] as
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:49.020] additional
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:49.520] material,
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:49.980] in
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:50.280] particular,
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:50.600] telling
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:50.720] you
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:50.860] how
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:50.980] to
[01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:51.120] deal
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:51.280] with
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:51.620] infinite
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:52.340] MDPs,
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:53.520] continuous
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:53.920] MDPs,
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:54.520] partially
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:54.980] observable
[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:55.640] MDPs,
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:56.840] undiscounted
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:57.160] average
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:57.440] reward
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:57.920] MDPs.
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:58.060] These
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:58.160] are
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:58.320] the
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:58.920] major
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:40:59.400] extensions
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:40:59.600] to
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:40:59.660] the
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:40:59.900] MDP
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:00.460] framework.
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:01.380] Just
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:01.500] to
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:01.620] give
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:01.720] you
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:01.920] some
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:02.340] sense,
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:02.920] I
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.080] think
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:03.320] just
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:03.520] out
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:03.640] of
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:03.900] interest,
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:04.060] you
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:04.180] can
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:04.340] get
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:04.520] some
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:04.820] sense.
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:04.980] It's
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:05.140] not
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:05.520] details.
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:05.740] It's
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:05.900] just
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:06.020] a
[01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:06.200] brief
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:06.600] outline.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.340] Showing
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:07.440] you
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:07.560] how
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:07.680] you
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:07.800] can
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:07.980] move
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:08.280] beyond
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:08.500] this
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:08.620] to
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:08.740] the
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:08.980] case
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:09.320] where,
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.040] where
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:10.880] you're
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:11.000] trying
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:11.140] to
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:11.580] control
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:12.020] some
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:12.680] real
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:13.380] aeroplane
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:13.560] or
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:13.900] helicopter
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:14.300] with
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:15.100] continuous
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:15.500] actions
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:15.780] and
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:16.240] perhaps
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:16.400] even
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:16.780] continuous
[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:17.060] time
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:17.440] steps
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:19.080] or
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:19.500] where
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:20.040] the
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:20.460] state
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:20.600] that
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:20.680] you
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:20.820] see
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:21.100] doesn't
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:21.280] tell
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:21.360] you
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:21.600] everything
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:21.840] about
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:21.980] the
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:22.300] environment,
[01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:22.500] but
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:22.580] you
[01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:22.760] just
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:22.940] get
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:23.100] to
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:23.320] see
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:23.600] like
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:23.980] the
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:24.360] robot's
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:24.660] camera
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:25.420] at
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:25.660] every
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:25.860] given
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:26.180] time
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:26.440] step.
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:26.560] And
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:26.660] you
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:27.440] don't
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:27.620] get
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:28.300] exposed
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:28.480] to
[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:28.580] the
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:28.860] Markov
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:29.200] state
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:29.500] that's
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:29.720] actually
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:30.040] inside
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:30.180] the
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:30.500] environment.
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:31.040] You
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:31.200] just
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:31.340] get
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:31.480] to
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:31.640] see
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:31.880] what
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:32.240] your
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:32.500] agent
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:32.900] sees
[01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:33.020] at
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:33.140] that
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:33.420] moment.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:34.520] And
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:34.820] finally,
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:35.040] the
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:35.280] case
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:35.860] where
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:36.100] we
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:36.580] can
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:36.760] deal
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:36.900] with
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:37.600] undiscounted
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:37.880] cases
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:38.080] by
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:38.440] basically
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:39.100] looking
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:39.320] at
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:39.860] a
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:40.100] limiting
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:40.460] case
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:40.600] where
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:40.680] we
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:41.020] average
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:41.320] over,
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:42.660] where
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:42.760] we
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:42.880] look
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:42.980] at
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:43.080] the
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:43.360] average
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:43.680] reward
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:43.880] going
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:44.020] into
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:44.140] the
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:44.380] future,
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:44.600] the
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:44.800] average
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.040] reward
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:45.200] per
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:45.400] time
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:45.640] step
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:46.620] instead
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:46.800] of
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:46.920] the
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:47.340] discounted
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:47.500] sum
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:47.620] of
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:47.940] rewards.
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:48.140] It's
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:48.220] a
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:48.440] different
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:48.820] definition
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:48.980] of
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:49.300] return
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:49.540] that
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:49.960] actually
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:50.260] works
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:50.380] out
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:50.600] very
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:50.800] neatly.
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:53.660] So
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:54.060] just
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:54.220] if
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:54.340] you're
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:54.540] feeling
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:55.080] enthusiastic,
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:55.480] go
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:55.580] and
[01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:55.700] have
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:55.800] a
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:55.980] look.
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:41:56.200] There's
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:56.480] pointers
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:56.680] to
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:56.980] elsewhere.
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:41:58.360] And
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:58.700] otherwise,
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:41:59.580] the
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:41:59.840] remainder
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.180] is
[01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:00.580] next
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:00.780] week
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:00.920] we'll
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:01.140] start
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:01.220] to
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:01.380] talk
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:01.520] about
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:01.640] how
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:01.780] to
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:01.960] solve
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:02.140] these
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:02.360] things.
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:02.520] So
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:02.640] this
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:02.720] is
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:02.880] just
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:03.220] defining
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:03.360] the
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:03.620] problem.
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:04.240] Next
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:04.300] week.
