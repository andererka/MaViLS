[00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.030] page,
[00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.550] there
[00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.730] is
[00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.910] a

[00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.870] So
[00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.110] I
[00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.310] would
[00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.870] recommend

[00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.150] if
[00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.290] you
[00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.830] can,

[00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.930] this
[00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.670] recommended
[00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.270] reading,
[00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.010] which
[00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.150] is
[00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.650] available,

[00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.230] internet.
[00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.070] And
[00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.330] that
[00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.490] will
[00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.850] make
[00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.030] it
[00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.650] easier
[00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.250] for
[00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.450] you
[00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.810] to

[00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.050] the
[00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.450] lecture.
[00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.610] Because
[00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.190] this
[00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.670] course,

[00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.630] audition,
[00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.230] relies
[00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.650] on
[00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.670] imparting
[00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.850] a
[00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.070] great
[00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.330] many
[00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.910] facts
[00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.650] about

[00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.450] workings
[00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.610] of

[00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.030] two
[00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.590] systems.
[00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.630] And
[00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.170] it's
[00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.570] easier
[00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.950] to
[00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.430] be

[00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.390] memorize
[00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.910] these
[00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.410] facts
[00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.870] by
[00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.270] doing
[00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.510] the

[00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.950] you
[00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.230] can.
[00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.210] All
[00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.390] right,
[00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.630] so
[00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.070] today
[00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.450] then,
[00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.910] what

[00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.310] And
[00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.590] then
[00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.830] we're
[00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.850] going

[00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.610] the
[00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.830] very
[00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.170] end,
[00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.350] we'll
[00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.610] talk
[00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.770] a

[00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.470] I
[00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.670] will
[00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.050] try
[00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.290] to
[00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.670] tell
[00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.850] you
[00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.250] about

[00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.550] people
[00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.730] have
[00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.930] thought
[00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.230] about
[00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.590] things
[00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.830] and
[00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.090] what
[00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.370] the
[00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.810] progression
[00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.750] is
[00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.450] of
[00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.110] the
[00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.250] discoveries
[00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.590] that
[00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.750] have
[00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.950] been
[00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.170] made
[00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.450] about
[00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.650] the
[00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.970] visual
[00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.490] system.
[00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.970] It
[00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.150] is
[00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.490] certainly
[00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.790] an
[00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.290] area
[00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.550] of
[00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.090] research
[00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.590] which
[00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.810] has
[00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.150] been
[00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.950] incredibly
[00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.710] successful
[00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.450] and
[00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.790] has
[00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.590] resulted
[00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.310] in
[00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.550] quite
[00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.730] a
[00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.010] number
[00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.230] of
[00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.550] Nobel
[00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.170] Prizes
[00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.930] for
[00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.110] the
[00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.630] discoveries
[00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.250] that
[00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.850] individuals
[00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.210] had
[00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.710] made
[00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.430] in
[00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.150] uncovering
[00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.330] the
[00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.830] workings
[00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.990] of
[00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.190] this
[00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.650] system.
[00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.610] Furthermore,
[00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.490] many
[00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.650] of
[00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.850] the
[00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.790] uncoverings
[00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.350] that
[00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.990] investigators
[00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.550] had
[00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.090] done
[00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.370] came
[00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.790] about
[00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.190] as
[00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.090] incredible
[00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.870] surprises.
[00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.470] Because
[00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.830] so
[00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.010] many
[00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.130] of
[00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.290] the
[00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.310] findings
[00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.630] were
[00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.030] quite
[00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.770] unexpected.
[00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.690] And
[00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.270] I
[00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.430] will
[00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.990] try
[00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.570] to
[00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.370] point
[00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.990] these
[00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.290] things
[00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.790] out
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.920] during
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.180] the
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.600] course.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.220] And
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.520] my
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.940] section,
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.160] as
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.360] I've
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.640] mentioned
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.160] before,
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.560] will
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.020] consist
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.240] of
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.660] 12
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.200] lectures.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.120] And
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.480] then
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.980] that
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.140] will
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.420] be
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.760] followed
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.700] on
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.000] October
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.540] 23
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.940] by
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.160] a
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.580] midterm
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.160] exam.
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.700] And
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.980] again,
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.580] to
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.100] reiterate,
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.880] that's
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.000] going
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.120] to
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.660] consist
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.140] of
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.300] a
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.560] series
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.800] of
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.240] multiple
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.780] choice
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.460] questions.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.400] And
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.680] then
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.200] following
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.660] that,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.940] we'll
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.200] move
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.740] on
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.080] to
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.200] talk
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.660] about
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.100] the
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.760] auditory
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.220] system
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.740] that
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.020] Chris
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.360] Brown
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.580] is
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.840] going
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.420] to
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.580] be
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.080] presenting
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.360] to
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.560] you.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.340] All
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.540] right,
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.820] so
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.020] the
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.340] first
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.560] thing
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.720] I
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.940] want
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.100] to
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.280] do
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.560] then
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.100] is
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.260] to
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.500] talk
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.780] about
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.960] the
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.340] basic
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.800] wiring
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.440] of
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.600] the
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.920] visual
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.500] system,
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.300] which
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.840] in
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.400] itself
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.980] has
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.680] yielded
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.000] a
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.240] number
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.860] of
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.520] unexpected
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.320] surprises
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.920] and
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.420] also
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.760] raised
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.980] some
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.400] interesting
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.940] questions.
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.580] So
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.760] what
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.880] I
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.000] want
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.100] to
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.520] start
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.780] with
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.100] first
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.300] of
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.580] all
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.220] is
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.700] that
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.960] when
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.240] you
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.920] look
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.440] at
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.940] some
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.380] animals
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.620] that
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.800] have
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.220] sideways
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.660] looking
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.080] eyes,
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.520] like
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.720] the
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.060] rabbit
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.740] and
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.060] most
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.740] amphibia,
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.300] the
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.560] two
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.940] eyes
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.360] look
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.600] out
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.780] in
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.920] two
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.260] different
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.880] directions,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.240] to
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.360] the
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.540] left
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.680] and
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.780] to
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.940] the
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.280] right.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.020] And
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.420] that
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.820] enables
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.040] them
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.220] to
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.460] see
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.660] a
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.180] very
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.620] large
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.140] portion
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.640] of
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.800] the
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.140] visual
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.680] field.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.240] And
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.480] when
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.780] that
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.740] is
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.960] the
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.380] case,
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.900] as
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.080] in
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.480] this
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.200] picture
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.540] shown
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.720] here
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.880] for
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.060] the
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.420] rabbit,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.180] what
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.300] you
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.740] find
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.980] is
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.200] that
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.460] there's
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.660] only
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.840] a
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.260] small
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.140] area
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.300] which
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.540] is
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.780] seen
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.000] by
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.400] both
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.020] eyes.
[00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.050] But
[00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.370] then
[00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.550] when
[00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.710] we
[00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.970] look
[00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:03.270] at
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.780] higher
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.340] mammals,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.080] in
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.440] particular
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.200] primates
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.400] and
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.820] humans,
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.300] what
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.440] you
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.760] find
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.920] is
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.960] that
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.140] there
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.300] was
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.660] a
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.460] huge
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.980] change
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.140] in
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.280] the
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.520] course
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.680] of
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.200] evolution,
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.320] bringing
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.620] the
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.940] eyes
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.100] to
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.320] the
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.660] front.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.660] Now
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.440] that
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.780] change
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.560] is
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.840] very
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.300] interesting.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.520] And
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.660] we
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.800] can
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.240] ask,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.880] why
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.020] on
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.300] earth
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.440] did
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.660] that
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.120] happen?
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.940] Because
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.240] it
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.640] meant
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.240] that
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.040] obviously
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.640] a
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.940] human
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.580] cannot
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.900] see
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.400] behind
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.120] themselves,
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.700] where
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.460] these
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.180] rabbits
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.520] can
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.780] see
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.920] a
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.120] much
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.520] larger
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.880] portion
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.060] of
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.100] the
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.380] visual
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.820] field.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.320] And
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.460] so
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.660] you
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.200] sacrifice
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.560] the
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.940] ability
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.740] to
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.420] see
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.640] all
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.720] the
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.900] way
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.240] around
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.420] the
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.780] world
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.700] for
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.980] being
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.220] able
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.460] to
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.800] see
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.580] with
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.940] both
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.200] eyes
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.360] to
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.520] the
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.800] front.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.460] And
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.660] so
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.840] the
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.200] question
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.400] is,
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.640] why
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.820] did
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.040] this
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.420] happen?
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.300] Now
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.500] we
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.800] are
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.020] going
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.180] to
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.600] discuss
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.880] this
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.060] in
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.300] some
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.860] detail
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.580] because
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.000] one
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.120] of
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.280] the
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.640] prime
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.100] reasons,
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.880] I
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.220] believe
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.420] at
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.680] least,
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.140] that
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.380] this
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.600] has
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.040] happened
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.780] is
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.120] to
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.320] be
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.500] able
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.740] to
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.140] process
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.880] information
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.340] about
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.860] depth
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.620] better
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.460] than
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.080] it
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.260] can
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.440] be
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.660] done
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.920] by
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.240] rabbits
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.640] and
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.880] other
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.300] animals.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.800] And
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.980] so
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.120] when
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.240] we
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.500] talk
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.780] about
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.980] depth
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.520] perception,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.060] we
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.200] are
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.440] going
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.800] to
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.580] deal
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.800] with
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.020] this
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.320] issue
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.500] in
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.700] more
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.140] detail.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.860] Now
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.480] if
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.620] you
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.860] look
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.100] at
[00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.170] an
[00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.450] animal
[00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.730] like
[00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.930] a
[00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.270] rabbit,
[00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.330] what
[00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.470] you
[00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.950] find,
[00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.270] and
[00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.690] also
[00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.630] animals
[00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.950] which
[00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.250] are,
[00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.750] as
[00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.970] I've
[00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.310] mentioned
[00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.830] already,
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.740] sorry
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.960] I'm
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.200] going
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.640] backwards
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.140] here,
[00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.990] that
[00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.110] you
[00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.310] also
[00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.490] have
[00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.650] in
[00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.850] fish
[00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.970] and
[00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:27.570] amphibia,
[00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.050] you
[00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.210] have
[00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.430] these
[00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.810] sideways
[00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.290] looking
[00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.810] eyes.
[00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.230] And
[00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.450] now
[00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.570] we
[00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.770] can
[00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.030] ask
[00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.190] the
[00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.670] question,
[00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.630] how
[00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.810] do
[00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.170] these
[00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.670] two
[00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.350] eyes
[00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.130] make
[00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.370] their
[00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.970] connections
[00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.390] through
[00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.550] the
[00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.910] ganglion
[00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.410] cells
[00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.810] to
[00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.990] the
[00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.270] central
[00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.650] nervous
[00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.090] system?
[00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.730] And
[00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.970] that,
[00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.170] in
[00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.450] fact,
[00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.030] was
[00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.290] quite
[00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.470] an
[00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.770] issue
[00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.990] at
[00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.190] one
[00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.450] time,
[00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.710] believe
[00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.890] it
[00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.990] or
[00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.250] not,
[00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.710] before
[00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.330] anatomical
[00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.890] techniques
[00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.330] became
[00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.590] more
[00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.210] sophisticated.
[00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.850] And
[00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.070] the
[00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.330] reason
[00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.490] it
[00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.810] became
[00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:51.030] an
[00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.450] issue
[00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.030] is
[00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.410] because
[00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.730] it
[00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.930] was
[00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.630] discovered
[00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.490] predominantly,
[00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.050] actually,
[00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.430] by
[00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.090] Cajal,

[00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.130] have
[00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.490] mentioned
[00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.750] had
[00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.090] received
[00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.290] the

[00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.870] he
[00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.050] had
[00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.350] done
[00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.110] on
[00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.770] not
[00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.970] only
[00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.130] the

[00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.010] but
[00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.570] in
[00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.990] general
[00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.790] about

[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.840] he
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.340] discovered,
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.160] as
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.320] did
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.600] several
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.820] other
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.440] investigators,
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.280] that
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.800] the

[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.320] And
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.580] so
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.820] the
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.220] input
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.500] from

[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.500] half
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.660] of

[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.280] And
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.520] that
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.900] became
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.100] a
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.520] huge
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.860] issue.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.200] Why
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.380] on
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.640] earth
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.820] would
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.100] this
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.540] happen?
[00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.650] And
[00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.910] we
[00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:33.330] are
[00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.630] going
[00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.050] to
[00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.570] deal
[00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.810] with
[00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.050] this
[00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.610] repeatedly.
[00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.430] It's
[00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.510] a
[00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.710] very
[00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.170] interesting
[00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.710] issue.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.020] And
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.580] even
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.920] more
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.360] interesting
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.640] is
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.840] the
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.120] fact
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.540] that
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.720] when
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.940] the
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.300] eyes
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.600] move
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.760] to
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.980] the
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.400] front,
[00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.550] what
[00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.970] happened
[00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.250] is
[00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.730] that
[00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.030] this
[00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.290] kind
[00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.430] of
[00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.990] connection
[00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.270] became
[00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.410] much
[00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.630] more
[00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.230] complicated.
[00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.810] But
[00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.150] before
[00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.370] I
[00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.510] do
[00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.710] that,
[00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.930] let
[00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.050] me
[00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.270] just
[00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.450] say
[00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.590] a
[00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.770] few
[00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.010] more
[00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.370] words
[00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.570] here.
[00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.170] First
[00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.370] of
[00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.610] all,
[00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.270] that
[00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.990] in
[00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.350] fission
[00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.030] amphibia,
[00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.450] you
[00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.570] have
[00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.710] a
[00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.150] huge
[00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.790] structure
[00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:01.150] called
[00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.350] the
[00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.750] optic
[00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.430] tectum,
[00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:03.090] which
[00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.210] is
[00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.430] the
[00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.950] primary
[00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.090] visual
[00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.810] processing
[00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.430] center
[00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.730] in
[00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.890] the
[00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.230] brain.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.720] And
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.360] there
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.620] is
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.120] also
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.880] the
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.140] lateral
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.500] geniculate
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.860] nucleus
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.020] of
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.160] the
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.780] thalamus
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.260] in
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.460] these
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.780] animals,
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.040] but
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.300] that's
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.600] quite
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.080] small
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.360] and
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.600] not
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.880] very
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.160] well
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.640] developed.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.960] And
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.400] there
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.800] is
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.380] a
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.720] cortex
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.120] in
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.360] these
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.740] animals,
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.260] but
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.420] it
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.600] is,
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.860] again,
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.040] a
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.380] primitive
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.020] area
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.220] compared
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.740] to
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.440] primates,
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.640] for
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.060] example.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.740] And
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.900] the
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.140] lateral
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.560] geniculate
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.920] nucleus
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.560] projects
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.800] to
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.040] the
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.380] cortex.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:31.980] So
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.200] the
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.520] left
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.020] cortex
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.240] in
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.440] these
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.880] animals
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.320] gets
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.600] input
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.880] from
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.060] the
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.280] right
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.560] eye.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.160] And
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.320] the
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.620] opposite
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.880] is
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.020] the
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.280] case
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:37.660] for
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:37.860] the
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.120] right
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.540] cortex.
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.300] And
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.480] so
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.120] consequently,
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:40.840] this
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.320] cortex
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.600] sees
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.900] this
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.140] part
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.280] of
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:42.340] the
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.580] visual
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:42.920] field.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.220] And
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:43.440] this
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:43.820] cortex
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.220] sees
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:44.740] this
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.000] part
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.120] of
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.180] the
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.380] visual
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.800] field.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.480] It's
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.300] almost
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.580] like
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:47.720] an
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.220] inversion.
[00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.650] Now
[00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.350] we
[00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.610] come
[00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:50.870] to
[00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.370] what
[00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:51.890] happened
[00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.310] as
[00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.450] a
[00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:52.790] result
[00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.990] of
[00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.150] the
[00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.470] eyes
[00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:53.810] moving
[00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.010] to
[00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:54.190] the
[00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:54.490] front.
[00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.490] When
[00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.670] the
[00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.970] eyes
[00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:56.270] moved
[00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.410] to
[00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:56.670] the
[00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.030] front
[00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.710] in
[00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.870] the
[00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.090] course
[00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:58.270] of
[00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.790] evolution,
[00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.330] that
[00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.490] necessitated
[00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.090] a
[00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:01.510] major
[00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.430] rewiring
[00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.190] in
[00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:03.330] the
[00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:03.630] visual
[00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.110] system.
[00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.010] So
[00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:05.590] that's
[00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:05.710] what
[00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.830] we
[00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.930] are
[00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:06.130] going
[00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:06.290] to
[00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.490] look
[00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:06.670] at
[00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.070] next,
[00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.630] because
[00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.270] that's
[00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.770] us,
[00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:09.270] all
[00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.490] right?
[00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.350] So
[00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.490] what
[00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:11.670] we
[00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.950] have
[00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.270] here
[00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.570] then,
[00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:12.770] we
[00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.910] have
[00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.050] the
[00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:13.230] two
[00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.450] eyes
[00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:13.710] looking
[00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.910] to
[00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.110] the
[00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.430] front.
[00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.030] And
[00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:15.490] imagine
[00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:15.730] that
[00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:15.950] these
[00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.150] two
[00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.350] eyes
[00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.450] are
[00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:16.590] now
[00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:16.850] looking
[00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.070] at
[00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.350] something.
[00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.610] There's
[00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:17.770] a
[00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.070] dot
[00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.470] here.
[00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.930] And
[00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.190] both
[00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:19.430] eyes
[00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.570] are
[00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:19.830] looking
[00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.030] at
[00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:20.190] the
[00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.490] same
[00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:20.930] dot
[00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:21.390] so
[00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.590] that
[00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:21.690] you
[00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:21.870] only
[00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.150] see
[00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.330] a
[00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:22.650] single
[00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.110] dot,
[00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.870] OK?
[00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:24.430] So
[00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.730] now
[00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:24.950] what
[00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.370] happens
[00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:25.610] is
[00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.830] really
[00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.210] something
[00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.890] surprising.
[00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:27.450] What
[00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:27.930] happens
[00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:28.210] is
[00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.670] that
[00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:30.330] the,
[00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:31.730] let
[00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:31.850] me
[00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:32.590] interrupt
[00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:32.830] for
[00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:32.990] a
[00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.190] second
[00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.630] and
[00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:33.930] tell
[00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:34.150] you
[00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:34.450] that
[00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.050] imagine
[00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:35.810] that
[00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.930] you
[00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.290] cut
[00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.490] your
[00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:36.770] eye,
[00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.150] I
[00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:37.270] mean
[00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:37.490] don't
[00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:37.730] do
[00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.930] it,
[00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.170] but
[00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:38.670] imagine
[00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:39.250] that
[00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:39.430] you're
[00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.710] cutting
[00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:39.850] your
[00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:40.010] eye
[00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.470] vertically
[00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:40.710] in
[00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:41.070] half,
[00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:41.450] each
[00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:41.730] eye,
[00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:42.210] OK?
[00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.270] And
[00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:43.570] that
[00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:43.910] means
[00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.110] that
[00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.430] each
[00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:44.770] eye
[00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.310] has,
[00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.730] if
[00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:45.910] you
[00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:46.210] will,
[00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.730] a
[00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.130] nasal
[00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:47.670] half
[00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.090] and
[00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:48.290] a
[00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.670] temporal
[00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.170] half,
[00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:49.630] all
[00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.830] right?
[00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.370] So
[00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:50.630] here
[00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.790] we
[00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.970] have
[00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:51.090] the
[00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:51.330] two
[00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:51.710] eyes.
[00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:52.150] Here's
[00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.290] the
[00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:52.570] left
[00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:52.970] eye.
[00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.470] And
[00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.690] what
[00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.830] we
[00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:54.070] have
[00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.230] is
[00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.430] a
[00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.910] nasal
[00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.790] half,
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.060] OK,
[00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.670] projects
[00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.330] across.
[00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:00.050] And
[00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.230] the
[00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.430] same
[00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.650] thing
[00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.790] is
[00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.950] true
[00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:01.190] for
[00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.510] the
[00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.010] right
[00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:02.330] eye,
[00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:03.170] projects
[00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.730] across.
[00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.530] But
[00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:04.890] now
[00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:05.070] if
[00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:05.170] you
[00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:05.370] look
[00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:05.530] at
[00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:05.730] the
[00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.110] temporal
[00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.170] hemiretinae,
[00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.370] hemiretinae
[00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:08.790] remember,
[00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:09.130] that's
[00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.290] the
[00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.510] word
[00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:09.770] for
[00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:09.950] it,
[00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:10.950] something
[00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.270] very
[00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:11.690] interesting
[00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:12.210] happens.
[00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.070] The
[00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.850] temporal
[00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:14.710] hemiretinae
[00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.290] don't
[00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.630] cross
[00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.930] over,
[00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:16.330] but
[00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:16.470] they
[00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.870] remain
[00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.050] on
[00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:17.210] the
[00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.430] same
[00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.910] side.
[00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.610] So
[00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:18.770] we
[00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:18.910] have
[00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:19.070] a
[00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.290] color
[00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:19.690] code
[00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.050] here
[00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:20.650] that
[00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:20.890] the
[00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.210] red
[00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.990] parts
[00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:23.990] project
[00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.510] across,
[00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.130] and
[00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.290] the
[00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:25.570] black
[00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.010] parts
[00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.630] also
[00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.270] project
[00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.910] across
[00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:28.490] from
[00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.750] one
[00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.070] eye,
[00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:29.430] but
[00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.650] stay
[00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.230] ipsilateral
[00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.690] for
[00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:30.870] the
[00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.110] other
[00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.430] eye.
[00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.430] So
[00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.670] you
[00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.890] say,
[00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:33.230] my
[00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.730] god,
[00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:34.130] why
[00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.370] did
[00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.750] this
[00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.210] happen?
[00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:35.430] What
[00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.590] on
[00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.850] earth
[00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:36.030] is
[00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.390] going
[00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:36.890] on?
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.000] And
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.300] then
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:38.500] if
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:38.640] you
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.040] study
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.480] this,
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.240] you
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:40.960] realize
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.000] that
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.160] this
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:43.360] is
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:43.840] actually
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.520] one
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:44.620] of
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:44.680] the
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:44.900] few
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.360] truly
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:45.980] logical
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.660] things
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.120] that
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.280] you
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:47.740] encounter
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.000] when
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.120] you
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.380] study
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:48.580] the
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:48.860] brain.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.220] Many
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.340] of
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:49.440] the
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:49.640] things
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:49.740] you
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:49.980] study
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.140] in
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.260] the
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:50.580] brain
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.180] don't
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.920] seem
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.080] to
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.220] be
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:52.420] too
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:52.880] logical,
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:53.920] because
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.080] in
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.180] the
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.400] force
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:54.600] of
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.400] evolution,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:55.900] you
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.000] have
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.160] to
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.500] change
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:56.800] things
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:56.940] in
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.180] very
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.680] peculiar,
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.700] subtle
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.260] ways
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:09:59.620] to
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:09:59.840] make
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.140] things
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:00.440] work.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:00.600] You
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:00.840] couldn't
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.160] just
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.080] redo
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.280] the
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.480] whole
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:02.820] system
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.060] from
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.520] scratch.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.160] But
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:04.420] this
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:04.600] is
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:04.900] certainly
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.100] a
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.460] logical
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:05.800] one,
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:05.960] and
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.280] I'll
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:06.660] explain
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:06.840] it
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:06.980] to
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.140] you
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.280] in
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:07.520] just
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:07.680] a
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:07.840] minute.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:08.920] OK,
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.180] so
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:09.460] now
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:09.660] what
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:09.800] we
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:09.980] do
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.420] next
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.080] is
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.760] that
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.600] again,
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.180] we
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:14.280] have
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.420] the
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.600] two
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:14.900] lateral
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.380] geniculate
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:15.900] nuclei.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.660] But
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.120] now,
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:17.720] these
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:17.840] are
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:17.900] in
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.040] the
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.980] thalamus,
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.320] these
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:19.600] two
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.100] nuclei
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.600] have
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.200] grown
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:21.940] tremendously
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.300] in
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:22.720] size
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.160] and
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.460] became
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:23.820] much
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.020] more
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.480] important
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:24.720] in
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.000] visual
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.620] processing,
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:26.800] as
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.380] did
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:27.840] then
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.780] the
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.540] cortex.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:30.600] This
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.200] process,
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:31.600] by
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:31.740] the
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:31.920] way,
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.040] is
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.280] called
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.300] encephalization.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.500] So
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:34.700] in
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.000] primitive
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.540] animals,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:35.660] you
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:35.760] have
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:35.940] very
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.240] small
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:36.700] cortex.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.400] And
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:37.540] then
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:37.680] in
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:37.780] the
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:37.980] course
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.140] of
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.600] evolution,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:38.860] the
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.120] cortex
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.500] grew
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:39.720] and
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:39.900] grew
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.100] and
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.240] grew
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.440] and
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:40.620] grew
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.140] and
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.620] became
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.180] a
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:42.580] more
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:42.720] and
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:42.860] more
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.380] important
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.160] structure
[00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:45.040] in
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.720] being
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.040] able
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.440] to
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.220] analyze
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:47.960] just
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.200] about
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.660] anything
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:48.800] and
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.220] certainly
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:49.980] analyze
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.480] vision.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.240] Now,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:51.540] here
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:51.760] we
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.140] have
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:52.960] a
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.520] cortical
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:53.860] area
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.000] in
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.080] the
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.420] posterior
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:54.860] part
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.480] of
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:55.620] the
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:55.980] brain,
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.380] as
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:56.540] I
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:56.900] pointed
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.200] out
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.320] to
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:57.400] you
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:57.540] the
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:57.800] last
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.120] time.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:58.900] And
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.080] what
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.240] we
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:10:59.420] have
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:10:59.540] is
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:10:59.660] a
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:10:59.900] whole
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.340] series
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:00.660] of
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.000] visual
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.620] areas
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:01.860] in
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.040] the
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.580] cortex.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.380] Most
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:04.760] central
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.020] one,
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.180] I
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:05.420] guess,
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:05.620] would
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:05.820] be
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.180] area
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.000] V1,
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:07.360] the
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:07.900] primary
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.120] visual
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.720] cortex,
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:10.340] to
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:10.580] which
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.000] the
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.260] lateral
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:11.720] geniculate
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.220] projects
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:12.860] most
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.540] profusely.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.220] Then
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.340] we
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:14.460] have
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:14.560] a
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:14.700] whole
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:14.940] bunch
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.080] of
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.340] other
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:15.720] visual
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.340] areas,
[00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.450] as
[00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:18.890] we'll
[00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.330] discuss
[00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:19.510] in
[00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:19.710] more
[00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.050] detail
[00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:20.410] later
[00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:20.870] on.
[00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:21.830] And
[00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:22.110] then
[00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.310] what
[00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.750] happens
[00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.070] is
[00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:23.490] that
[00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:23.650] we
[00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:23.790] have
[00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.150] several
[00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.290] other
[00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.430] cortical
[00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.950] areas.
[00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.190] The
[00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.570] cortex,
[00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:27.830] I
[00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:28.010] think
[00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:28.290] all
[00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:28.430] of
[00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.510] you
[00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:28.710] know
[00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.050] that,
[00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:29.470] is
[00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.910] divided
[00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.690] into
[00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.070] four
[00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:32.610] lobes,
[00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:33.050] OK?
[00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:33.530] The
[00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.890] frontal,
[00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.370] temporal,
[00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.950] parietal,
[00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.450] and
[00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:35.690] the
[00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.090] rear
[00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.290] one
[00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.450] is
[00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:36.670] called
[00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.810] the
[00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.270] occipital
[00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:37.670] lobes,
[00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.170] all
[00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.310] right?
[00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.110] Now,
[00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:39.710] the
[00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.070] visual
[00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:40.630] areas
[00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.230] that
[00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.330] you
[00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:41.570] see
[00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:41.710] in
[00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.810] the
[00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:42.110] back
[00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.410] here
[00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.930] make
[00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.530] extensive
[00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:44.670] interconnections
[00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.050] and
[00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.610] connections
[00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.330] to
[00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:46.830] these
[00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.110] other
[00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.970] lobes
[00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:49.510] in
[00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:49.690] the
[00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:49.990] brain
[00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.170] to
[00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:50.330] be
[00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:50.490] able
[00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:50.750] to
[00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.330] analyze
[00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:51.750] the
[00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.070] visual
[00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:52.530] scene.
[00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:53.570] Now,
[00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.750] in
[00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.230] addition,
[00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:55.010] what
[00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:55.210] we
[00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.570] have
[00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.410] still,
[00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:57.070] as
[00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:57.230] we
[00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.410] had
[00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:57.550] in
[00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:57.710] more
[00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:58.010] primitive
[00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:58.490] animals,
[00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.650] we
[00:11:58.650 --> 00:11:58.750] have
[00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.870] a
[00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:59.270] superior
[00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.110] colliculus.
[00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.770] Actually,
[00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.050] two
[00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:01.170] of
[00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:01.310] them,
[00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.450] one
[00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:01.590] on
[00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.790] each
[00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.170] side.
[00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:02.610] And
[00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:02.770] then
[00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:02.910] we
[00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:03.030] have
[00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.350] another
[00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.910] set
[00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.050] of
[00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:04.570] areas
[00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.190] called
[00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.370] the
[00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:05.650] terminal
[00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.110] nuclei,
[00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.490] the
[00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:06.830] nucleus
[00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:06.990] of
[00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.110] the
[00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.370] optic
[00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.830] tract,
[00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.470] about
[00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.770] which
[00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.030] we'll
[00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.270] just
[00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:09.550] talk
[00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:09.690] a
[00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:09.870] little
[00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.170] bit
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.400] about,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:12.660] because
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.480] they
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:13.740] are
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.560] specializing
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:14.780] in
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:15.080] certain
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.360] visual
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:15.880] functions,
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.320] but
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.560] not
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:16.880] nearly
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.380] as
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.300] compelling
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:18.580] and
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:18.960] interesting
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.820] as
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.240] the
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.520] work
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:20.700] that
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:20.880] has
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.200] been
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:21.580] done
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.360] in
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:22.760] the
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.120] cortical
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.700] areas
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:24.300] and
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:24.440] in
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:24.580] the
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:24.920] superior
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.420] colliculi.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.040] So
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.300] this
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:26.460] is
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:26.660] the
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.100] arrangement.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:27.620] But
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:27.960] now
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.140] we
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:28.300] want
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:28.440] to
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:28.960] understand,
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:29.320] why
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:29.500] do
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:29.660] we
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:29.860] have
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.060] this
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:30.600] strange
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.600] connection
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.040] here?
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:32.860] So
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.080] to
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.560] understand
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.180] that,
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:35.740] what
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.160] we
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:36.300] are
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:36.540] going
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:36.720] to
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.060] talk
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.380] about
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:37.580] is
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:37.780] the
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.040] so
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.300]-called
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.400] choropter,
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:39.960] or
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.080] the
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.620] Wiethmuller
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.180] circle.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.080] Now,
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.300] what
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:42.520] does
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:42.760] that?
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.060] Some
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.740] clever
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.000] guy
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.300] came
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:44.500] up
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:44.660] with
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:44.860] this
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.460] observation.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.200] They
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.520] made
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:46.740] a
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.160] circle
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.360] that
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:48.640] goes
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:48.860] through
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.020] the
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:49.320] nodal
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:49.580] point
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:49.720] of
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:49.860] the
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.200] eye,
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.080] and
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.620] its
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.060] diameter
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.580] depends
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:53.780] on
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.000] where
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.140] you
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.280] are
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:54.800] fixating.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.040] So
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.600] fixating
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.160] here,
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:56.800] all
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.020] right?
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:57.580] And
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:57.900] so
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.340] in
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:58.620] this
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:58.940] case,
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:12:59.380] the
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:12:59.660] red
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.220] area,
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:01.820] which
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.100] is
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.480] your
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:02.900] left
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.760] visual
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:04.480] hemifield,
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.580] impinges
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.120] on
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.300] the
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:06.620] nasal
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.040] retina
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.740] of
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.120] the
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.340] left
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:08.600] eye
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:08.800] and
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:08.980] the
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.280] temporal
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:09.600] retina
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:09.720] of
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:09.860] the
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.080] other
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.360] eye.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:10.960] So
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.080] if
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.200] you
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:11.480] have
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:11.680] an
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.240] object
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:12.920] here,
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.620] that
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.040] hits
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.920] corresponding
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.440] retinal
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.080] elements
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.120] in
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.620] the
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:18.860] two
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.360] eyes.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.400] And
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:20.920] that
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.100] is
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:21.260] the
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:21.580] basic
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:21.820] rule.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.340] Anywhere
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:22.700] along
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:22.980] this
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.580] choropter,
[00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:25.710] a
[00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.210] spot
[00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.670] will
[00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:27.250] activate
[00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:27.970] corresponding
[00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.170] regions
[00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:29.470] in
[00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.610] the
[00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:29.810] two
[00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.310] eyes.
[00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.130] And
[00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:31.450] then
[00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:31.650] what
[00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.050] happens
[00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:32.370] is
[00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:32.950] that
[00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:33.270] those
[00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:33.950] corresponding
[00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:34.670] points
[00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:35.150] go
[00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.310] to
[00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.570] the
[00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:35.910] same
[00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.570] location
[00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.370] in
[00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.070] the
[00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:38.310] lateral
[00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.690] geniculate
[00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.170] nucleus,
[00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:39.450] in
[00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:39.550] the
[00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.810] superior
[00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:40.330] colliculus,
[00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.030] and
[00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.230] in
[00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.350] the
[00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.650] visual
[00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.130] cortex.
[00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:42.890] So
[00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.110] the
[00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.470] logic
[00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.770] of
[00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:43.970] this
[00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:44.530] arrangement
[00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.050] is
[00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.410] to
[00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.610] be
[00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:45.890] able
[00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:46.110] to
[00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.370] have
[00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.550] the
[00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.810] two
[00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:47.410] eyes
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.040] have
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.680] input
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.420] to
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.620] corresponding
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.320] points
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:52.460] in
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:52.600] the
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:52.880] brain.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.340] That
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:53.520] way
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:53.660] you
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:53.800] can
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.100] see
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:54.540] something
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.340] uniform
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.340] and
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.740] clear,
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.180] rather
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:58.400] than
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:58.700] seeing
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.040] double.
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:13:59.740] So
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.040] that
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.220] is
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:00.420] then
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:00.600] the
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.120] arrangement
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.700] that
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:01.840] you
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.080] have
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.240] in
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:02.940] primates.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.020] Now,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:04.760] just
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:04.900] to
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.340] anticipate
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:05.600] a
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:05.740] little
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:05.980] bit,
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:06.640] whenever
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.080] images
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.380] fall
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:07.820] inside
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:08.040] or
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.360] outside
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:08.660] the
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.020] circle,
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:09.620] they
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:09.840] do
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.140] fall
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.320] on
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:10.560] non
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.220]-correspondent
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:11.640] points.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.080] And
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.260] that
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:12.420] will
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:12.600] have
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:12.880] something
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.100] to
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.280] do.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:13.400] And
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:13.560] I
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:13.740] keep
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:13.840] you
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.120] just
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:14.960] curious
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.320] about
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:15.520] that
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:15.660] for
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:15.820] the
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.080] time
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.320] being,
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.180] about
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:17.440] how
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:17.640] we
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.280] process
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.180] depth.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:20.860] And
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.160] that
[00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.530] is
[00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:22.670] the
[00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.190] mechanism
[00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:23.490] that
[00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:23.890] is
[00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:24.370] involved.
[00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:25.150] It's
[00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.350] called
[00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.050] stereopsis.
[00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.330] I've
[00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:26.610] mentioned
[00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:26.830] that
[00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.030] very
[00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.390] briefly
[00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:27.650] the
[00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.930] last
[00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:28.230] time.
[00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:28.910] OK.
[00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.750] So
[00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.190] that
[00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:30.630] then
[00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.750] summarizes
[00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.290] the
[00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.790] basic
[00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.530] connections
[00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:34.790] of
[00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.950] the
[00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.350] system.
[00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.950] And
[00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:36.190] then
[00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:36.450] what
[00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:36.610] you're
[00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:36.810] going
[00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:36.950] to
[00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:37.130] do
[00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:37.510] next
[00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:37.910] is
[00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.090] you're
[00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:38.150] going
[00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.230] to
[00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.370] go
[00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:38.530] to
[00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:38.770] the
[00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.130] retina
[00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:39.550] and
[00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.750] look
[00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.890] at
[00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:39.990] it
[00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.050] in
[00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:40.250] more
[00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:40.910] details
[00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:41.550] about
[00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.730] how
[00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:41.930] the
[00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:42.270] retina
[00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:42.590] is
[00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.030] made.
[00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.990] And
[00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.270] then
[00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:44.430] we
[00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.610] will
[00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:44.830] go
[00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:45.010] in
[00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:45.770] successive
[00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.250] steps
[00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.430] to
[00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.790] higher
[00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.350] areas,
[00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:48.050] sometimes
[00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.410] going
[00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.690] back
[00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:48.890] and
[00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:49.210] forth
[00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:49.590] to
[00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.810] try
[00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.010] to
[00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:50.690] understand
[00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.450] visual
[00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:52.050] processing
[00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:52.590] in
[00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:52.950] general.
[00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:53.710] All
[00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.910] right,
[00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.110] so
[00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.450] now
[00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:55.110] let's
[00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.610] begin
[00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.150] by
[00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.470] looking
[00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.730] at
[00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:56.930] the
[00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.290] eye.
[00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:58.390] Now,
[00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.710] I
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:00.560] don't
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:00.980] expect
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.100] you
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.320] to
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.020] know
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.500] all
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:02.800] these
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.280] names
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:03.700] here.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:04.580] But
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:04.900] you
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.140] should
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:05.580] remember,
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:05.780] of
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:05.940] course,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.140] the
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:06.560] lens
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.060] and
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:07.220] the
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:07.580] cornea.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:07.740] I
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:07.880] know
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.100] that
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:08.520] already.
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.100] You
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:09.260] know
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:09.520] the
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.060] iris,
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.380] right?
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:10.660] What's
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:10.820] the
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.260] iris?
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:13.900] Now,
[00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:15.610] what
[00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:16.110] do
[00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.290] we
[00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:16.610] base
[00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.570] our
[00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:17.970] views
[00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:18.310] on?
[00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:19.130] The
[00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:19.690] color
[00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:20.090] of
[00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.270] the
[00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:20.670] eye.
[00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:21.170] When
[00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.330] you
[00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:21.470] say
[00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.930] somebody
[00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:22.890] has
[00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:23.130] blue
[00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:23.470] eyes
[00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.610] or
[00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:23.970] somebody
[00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:24.310] has
[00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.430] brown
[00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.830] eyes,
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.260] it's
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:27.520] based
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:27.680] on
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:27.820] the
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.060] fact
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:28.160] of
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.340] what
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:28.580] the
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:28.940] coloring
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.400] is
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:29.900] of
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.140] the
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:30.720] iris,
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:31.360] all
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:31.520] right?
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.480] Now,
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:32.760] what's
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:32.960] the
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.460] iris?
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:33.740] The
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.460] iris
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.620] can
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.300] get
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:37.620] bigger
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:37.940] and
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:38.440] smaller
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:39.540] to
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.380] control
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.180] the
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:41.680] size
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:41.820] of
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:41.980] the
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:42.480] opening
[00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.810] into
[00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.030] the
[00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.390] lens,
[00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:45.050] all
[00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.230] right?
[00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.290] It's
[00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:46.550] much
[00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.070] like
[00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.110] what
[00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.290] you
[00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.550] have
[00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.810] in
[00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:49.430] cameras
[00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.350] where
[00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.470] you
[00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.630] have
[00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:51.770] the
[00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:51.950] so
[00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:52.150]-called
[00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.510] f
[00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:52.930]-stop,
[00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.390] right?
[00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:53.830] So
[00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:54.010] if
[00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.130] you
[00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:54.350] have
[00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.510] a
[00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.130] large
[00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:55.630] number,
[00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.450] say
[00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.210] f16
[00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:57.470] in
[00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.630] a
[00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:57.990] camera,
[00:15:58.690 --> 00:15:58.950] that
[00:15:58.950 --> 00:15:59.330] is
[00:15:59.330 --> 00:15:59.590] set
[00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.750] to
[00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.290] 16
[00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.490] if
[00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:00.570] you
[00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:00.670] do
[00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.810] it
[00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.310] manually
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.150] when
[00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.390] it's
[00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:02.710] bright
[00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.990] out
[00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.210] there.
[00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:03.610] But
[00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:03.790] when
[00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.990] it's
[00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.250] dim
[00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.530] out
[00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:04.810] there,
[00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:05.430] like
[00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.150] we
[00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.330] have
[00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:06.450] in
[00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:06.650] this
[00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.950] camera
[00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:07.330] here,
[00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:07.510] you
[00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:07.670] have
[00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.790] the
[00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.070] lens
[00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:08.390] wide
[00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:08.770] open
[00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:09.150] because
[00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.470] it's
[00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.810] pretty
[00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:10.170] dark
[00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:10.350] in
[00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.590] here.
[00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:11.410] Then
[00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:11.550] you
[00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.710] have
[00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.830] a
[00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:12.090] low
[00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:12.390] f
[00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:12.750]-stop,
[00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:13.250] like
[00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.410] an
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.460] f4
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:15.820] or
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.100] even
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.560] lower,
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:17.960] to
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.320] allow
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.620] more
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:18.880] light
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.040] to
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.280] come
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.660] in,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:20.420] more
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.020] photons
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:21.260] to
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:21.520] enter
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:21.800] the
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:21.960] eye.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:22.760] Now,
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:23.500] next
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:23.740] is
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:24.300] here's
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.460] the
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:24.920] lens.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:25.880] And
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.360] the
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.640] fascinating
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.200] thing
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:28.520] about
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:28.740] the
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.080] lens
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:29.340] is
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:29.900] that
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.100] in
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:30.340] the
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:30.720] eye,
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:30.960] the
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.240] lens
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:31.420] is
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:31.740] totally
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.280] different
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:32.720] from
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:32.880] the
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.120] way
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.400] it
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:33.800] is
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.780] in
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.140] a
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.480] camera.
[00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.690] Now,
[00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.470] maybe
[00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.750] by
[00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.070] now,
[00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:39.690] many
[00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:39.950] of
[00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:40.130] you
[00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.470] don't
[00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.670] even
[00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.870] know
[00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:41.090] the
[00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.590] details
[00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.970] about
[00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:42.170] a
[00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.530] camera.
[00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:43.250] But
[00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:43.950] one
[00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:44.050] of
[00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:44.210] the
[00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.670] details,
[00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.930] of
[00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:45.130] course,
[00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:45.450] is
[00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:46.050] that
[00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:46.430] to
[00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.850] bring
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.100] an
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.520] image
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:48.800] into
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.440] focus,
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:53.760] you
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.100] have
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.300] to
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:54.880] adjust
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.640] the
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.120] distance
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.300] of
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:56.460] the
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:56.820] lens
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:57.540] from
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:57.800] the
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.160] film
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:58.700] onto
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.020] which
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:16:59.520] the
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:16:59.760] image
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.360] projects,
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.040] OK?
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.200] So
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:02.380] the
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:02.800] closer
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.060] an
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.380] image,
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:03.760] the
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.100] further
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:04.420] out
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:04.560] the
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:04.780] lens
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.000] has
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.160] to
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:05.400] go.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:06.920] Now,
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:07.460] if
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:07.740] that
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:07.920] were
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.080] the
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:08.400] case
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.160] in
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.640] animals
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:09.860] and
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.320] humans,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:10.980] you
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.140] would
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:11.360] have
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:11.500] a
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:11.760] super
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.200] bulging
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.660] eye.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.060] So
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:13.100] if
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:13.200] you
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.360] looked
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:13.480] at
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:13.740] something
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.100] closely,
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.220] the
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.320] eye
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:14.480] would
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:14.660] go
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:14.860] out
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:15.100] like
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.420] that.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:15.760] And
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:15.880] that
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.000] would
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.100] be
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:16.360] really
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:16.940] disturbing.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:17.600] So
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:17.960] that
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.140] is
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:21.480] not
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:21.760] the
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.140] case.
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:22.740] Because
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:22.920] what
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.300] happened
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:23.720] instead
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.000] is
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.260] something
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:24.560] very
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.000] clever
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.200] that
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:26.840] you
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.080] don't
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:27.320] see
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:27.580] in
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.060] cameras,
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:28.720] which
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.140] is
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.560] that
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:29.700] you
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:29.860] have
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.080] this
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.480] lens
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:30.820] here,
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:31.440] which
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:31.660] is,
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:32.840] at
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.040] least
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:33.200] in
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:33.440] younger
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.880] people,
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:35.880] is
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.680] an
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.120] organ
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.200] that
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.100] can
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.480] vary
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:40.780] in
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.340] thickness,
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.100] OK?
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:42.880] So
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.060] you
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:43.540] have
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.240] here
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.800] some
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.360] muscles,
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:45.860] OK,
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.120] the
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:46.480] ciliary
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.000] muscles,
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.060] which
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.520] can
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.920] adjust
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.200] the
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:52.460] thickness
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:52.780] of
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.000] this
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.400] lens
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.860] to
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:54.360] allow
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:54.680] it
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:54.880] to
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.380] focus
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:55.960] properly
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.860] on
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.920] the
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.340] retina.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:58.820] Now,
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.200] here,
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:17:59.740] the
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.080] retina
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.820] goes
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.400] around.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:01.860] It's
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.140] against
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:02.380] the
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:02.660] inner
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:02.920] wall
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:03.100] of
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.260] the
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:03.580] eye,
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:03.780] as
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:03.900] you
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.060] all
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.160] know
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.400] that,
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:04.620] of
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:04.860] course.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:06.620] And
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.060] to
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.180] explain
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:08.940] how
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.220] this
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:09.420] is
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:09.700] done,
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:09.960] then,
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:10.200] very,
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:10.900] very
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.420] crudely,
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:11.920] here
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.140] we
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:12.380] have
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:12.540] it.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:12.780] If
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:12.880] you're
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:12.980] an
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:13.320] object
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:13.640] really
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.140] near,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:14.760] you
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.020] want
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:15.160] the
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:15.380] lens
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:15.560] to
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:15.720] be
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.080] thick
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.280] to
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:16.640] properly
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.180] focus
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:17.720] the
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.120] image
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:18.560] on
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.060] the
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:19.420] retina.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.160] And
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.340] if
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:20.700] the
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.320] image
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:21.560] is
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.020] far,
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:22.520] you
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:22.700] have
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:22.820] to
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.160] thin
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.360] the
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:23.800] lens
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.900] to
[00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.310] get
[00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.570] the
[00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:27.190] proper
[00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.730] focus
[00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:27.990] on
[00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.210] the
[00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:28.950] retina.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:30.640] So
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.060] that's
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.180] how
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:31.380] the
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:31.700] lens
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.260] works,
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.580] at
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:33.800] least
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.020] when
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.180] you're
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:34.500] reasonably
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:34.900] young.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:35.260] But
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:35.480] then
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:35.640] when
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:35.780] you
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:36.000] get
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.720] older,
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:37.580] what
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.000] happens
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.340] is
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.000] that
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.340] the
[00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.230] lens
[00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.490] becomes
[00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.070] progressively
[00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.630] stiffer
[00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.870] and
[00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:44.250] stiffer.
[00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:46.670] And
[00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:47.110] because
[00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.270] of
[00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.510] that,
[00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:48.030] you
[00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:48.250] have
[00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:48.410] to
[00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:48.750] start
[00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:49.150] wearing
[00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:49.730] glasses.
[00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.710] Now,
[00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:52.670] in
[00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:52.810] the
[00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:53.170] olden
[00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:53.410] days,
[00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:53.570] they
[00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.830] used
[00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.950] to
[00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:54.470] have
[00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.350] lenses
[00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.970] which
[00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:56.230] came
[00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.390] in
[00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.590] two
[00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.090] parts,
[00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.050] bifocals,
[00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.650] OK?
[00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.210] So
[00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.350] if
[00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.430] you
[00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.610] look
[00:18:59.610 --> 00:18:59.690] in
[00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.810] the
[00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.010] upper
[00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.310] part,
[00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:00.450] you
[00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:00.590] could
[00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.770] look
[00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.890] in
[00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.990] the
[00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.350] distance.
[00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.570] If
[00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:01.670] you
[00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:01.790] look
[00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:01.870] in
[00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:01.970] the
[00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:02.190] lower
[00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.510] part,
[00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:02.870] you
[00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.050] could
[00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:03.250] look
[00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:03.690] close.
[00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:04.690] Nowadays,
[00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.390] they
[00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.630] have
[00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.250] graduated
[00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:06.810] lenses.
[00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:07.350] So
[00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.730] if
[00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.810] you
[00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:07.990] look
[00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.090] in
[00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.230] the
[00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.450] upper
[00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.890] part,
[00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.610] you
[00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:09.810] can
[00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:10.030] look
[00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:10.410] far.
[00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:10.690] And
[00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:10.790] if
[00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:10.890] you
[00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.010] want
[00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:11.070] to
[00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.190] look
[00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.530] somewhere,
[00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.810] you're
[00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.910] going
[00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:12.010] to
[00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:12.190] look
[00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.990] down
[00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.490] below.
[00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.970] And
[00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:14.110] then
[00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.250] you
[00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:14.410] can
[00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:14.670] see
[00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:14.890] that
[00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:15.050] in
[00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:15.530] focus.
[00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.010] So
[00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.530] once
[00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:18.650] you
[00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.770] get
[00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:19.050] older,
[00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:19.530] these
[00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:19.910] lenses
[00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:20.330] don't
[00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.830] adjust
[00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:21.090] as
[00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:21.390] much,
[00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:21.850] still
[00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:22.010] a
[00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.150] little
[00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.390] bit.
[00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:23.150] But
[00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.450] the
[00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.110] proof
[00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.010] that
[00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.730] this
[00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.090] is
[00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.310] not
[00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.530] that
[00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.070] important,
[00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.450] thank
[00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:28.810] God,
[00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.070] now
[00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.330] that
[00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:29.510] we
[00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.750] have
[00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.150] these
[00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.690] graded
[00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.310] lenses
[00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.730] and
[00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:32.890] we
[00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:33.050] have
[00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:33.710] bifocals,
[00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.630] is
[00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.950] that
[00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:35.410] there
[00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:35.470] are
[00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:35.510] a
[00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.650] lot
[00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:35.810] of
[00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:36.130] people
[00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:36.330] in
[00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:36.650] old
[00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.190] age
[00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.230] who
[00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.990] develop,
[00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:39.690] and
[00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.050] sometimes
[00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:40.250] not
[00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.430] even
[00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.590] in
[00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.830] old
[00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.130] age.
[00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.010] In
[00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:42.970] India,
[00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.210] for
[00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:43.790] example,
[00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:44.310] there
[00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.330] are
[00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:44.430] a
[00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.530] lot
[00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:44.670] of
[00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:44.930] young
[00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:45.310] kids
[00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.510] who
[00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.770] have
[00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:46.410] cataracts.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:47.960] Now,
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:48.180] what
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:48.340] is
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:48.880] cataracts?
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:49.480] Cataracts
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.600] interferes
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:51.820] with
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.060] the
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.580] processing
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.460] of
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.220] vision
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:54.660] through
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:54.880] the
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.120] lens
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:55.640] system.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.100] Things
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:57.580] become
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.120] unclear
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:58.620] because
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:58.920] all
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.160] kinds
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:19:59.820] of
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.820] blockage
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.220] occur
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:02.560] in
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:02.740] the
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.020] lens
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:03.520] itself.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.140] So
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:04.980] how
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.260] is
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:05.460] that
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.040] corrected?
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:06.760] The
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:06.920] way
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.240] that's
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:07.640] corrected
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.380] nowadays
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.240] that
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:09.400] you
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:09.580] have
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:09.720] what
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:09.860] is
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.140] called
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.040] cataract
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.160] surgery.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.500] Got
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:13.680] it?
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.320] Cataract
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.060] surgery.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.400] So
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.640] what
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:16.800] they
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.080] do
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.500] then
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.360] is
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:18.580] they
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:18.960] actually,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:19.740] literally,
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.340] remove
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:20.620] the
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.060] lens
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:21.880] from
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.120] the
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:22.540] eye,
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.660] and
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:23.820] they
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.160] put
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.400] in
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:24.800] a
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.140] fixed
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:25.720] lens
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.020] made
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:27.660] out
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:27.800] of
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.200] plastic
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.460] or
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:28.900] glass.
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:30.780] And
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.240] then,
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.180] obviously,
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.560] since
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:32.760] there's
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:32.960] no
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.620] adjustment,
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.320] you
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:34.560] do
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:34.800] have
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:34.980] to
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:35.200] wear
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:35.760] glasses
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.800] to
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.600] look
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:37.760] at
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:37.960] things
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.260] far
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:38.560] away
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:38.820] and
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.020] look
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:39.180] at
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:39.460] things
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:39.920] close.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:40.380] And
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:40.700] most
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:40.880] of
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:40.960] the
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.200] time,
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:41.460] those
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:41.620] would
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.100] be
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:42.460] sort
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:42.600] of
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.240] graduated
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:43.840] lenses.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:44.820] And
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.020] so
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:45.420] people
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:45.860] who
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.040] have
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:46.460] cataract
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.000] surgery
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:48.760] can
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.280] see
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:49.780] extremely
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.300] well,
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:50.980] certainly
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.200] a
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.380] lot,
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:51.560] lot
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:51.860] better
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:52.860] than
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.460] having
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:53.840] to
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.620] try
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:54.840] to
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.020] deal
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:55.240] with
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:55.660] lenses
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.260] that
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:56.480] have
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.060] cataracts.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.080] All
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:58.260] right.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:58.660] Now,
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:58.980] there's
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.160] one
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:20:59.420] other
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:20:59.760] point
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:20:59.920] I
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.080] want
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.160] to
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:00.380] make
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:00.700] about
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:00.960] the
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.180] eye
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:01.400] here
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:01.720] before
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:01.980] we
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.200] move
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:02.600] on.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:03.700] Maybe
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.200] two
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:04.620] points.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.240] One
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:05.540] is
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.380] about
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.200] this
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:08.440] part
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:08.540] of
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:08.640] the
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:08.900] eye
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:09.700] that
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.060] you
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:10.400] have
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.020] here
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.640] your
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:11.860] so
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.080]-called
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:12.680] iris.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.440] And
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:14.940] what
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.060] do
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:15.240] you
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:15.540] call
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:15.840] what's
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:15.960] in
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.200] the
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:16.540] center
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:16.820] of
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.000] the
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.460] iris?
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.040] Pupil.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:19.380] Very
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:19.640] good.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:20.440] Now,
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.060] what
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:21.420] is
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:21.880] the
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.460] color
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:22.880] of
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.040] the
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:23.360] pupil?
[00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.510] In
[00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.930] most
[00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:27.250] people,
[00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:27.510] it's
[00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.910] black,
[00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.270] right?
[00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:29.510] Why
[00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.650] is
[00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:29.790] it
[00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:30.090] black?
[00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:30.350] How
[00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.830] come
[00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:31.030] the
[00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.450] pupil
[00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:31.670] is
[00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:31.970] black?
[00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.890] Any
[00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:33.230] thoughts
[00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.490] about
[00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:33.770] that?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.520] OK,
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:36.780] well,
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:36.920] let
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.060] me
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.380] tell
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.600] you.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.040] And
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.260] I
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:38.560] think
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.000] what
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.220] I'll
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:39.400] do
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:39.600] is
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.040] actually
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:40.660] I'll
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:40.900] move
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:41.360] on.
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:42.860] First,
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:43.980] I'll
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.200] leave
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:44.520] this
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.300] unanswered
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:45.460] for
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:45.700] just
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:45.860] a
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.000] few
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.360] minutes.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.680] This
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:47.960] I've
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.240] shown
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.400] you
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.980] before,
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.360] which
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:50.540] is
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:50.900] another
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:51.680] amazing
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.060] thing
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.360] about
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:52.580] the
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:52.920] eye,
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:53.480] is
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:53.900] namely
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.800] that
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.280] in
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:55.520] the
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.160] fovea,
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:57.060] you
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.440] have
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:57.840] something
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.220] like
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:58.820] 200
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:59.740],000
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.720] cones
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.140] per
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.300] square
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:02.920] millimeter.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:03.820] 200
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.340],000.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.100] As
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:06.260] you
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:06.460] go
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:06.940] five
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.260] degrees
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:07.600] out,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:07.820] it
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.460] reduces
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.560] tenfold
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:09.840] to
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.160] 20
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:10.540],000.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.180] And
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:11.380] then
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:11.540] you
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:11.760] go
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.660] 10
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.060] degrees,
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:13.300] it
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:13.680] reduces
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.100] by
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:14.500] half.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.420] So
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.380] because
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:16.540] of
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:16.700] this
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.000] very
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.320] high
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:17.880] density,
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:18.400] I've
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:18.680] mentioned
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:18.900] this
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.300] before,
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.260] in
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:20.440] the
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.020] fovea,
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.320] you
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:22.640] have
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.240] high
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:23.840] acuity.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:24.700] And
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:24.940] that
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.100] is
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:25.220] one
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:25.300] of
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:25.400] the
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:25.720] prime
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.060] reasons
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:26.200] you
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:26.360] have
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:26.500] to
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:26.720] move
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:26.900] your
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:27.160] eye
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.600] around,
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.080] so
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:28.280] that
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:28.400] you
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:28.580] can
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:28.880] see
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.220] things
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:29.400] in
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:29.740] fine
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.280] detail.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:31.520] All
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:31.740] right,
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:31.960] so
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.400] now
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.200] let's
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:34.940] take
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.260] another
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:35.740] step
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.080] here
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:36.640] and
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:36.900] look
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.140] at
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:37.600] the
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:37.900] retina
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.720] itself.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.500] And
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:40.700] let
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:40.880] me
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.240] first
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:41.400] of
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:41.540] all
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:41.760] point
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.040] out
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.220] to
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:42.420] you,
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.060] I
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:43.280] have
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:43.800] reversed
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.460] the
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:44.820] image
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.020] here
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.100] to
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:45.460] have
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:45.600] it
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.280] right
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:46.560] side
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:46.880] up.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.040] The
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:48.320] light
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:48.620] actually
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:48.960] comes
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.100] in
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:49.200] from
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.400] the
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:49.720] bottom,
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.060] goes
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:50.260] through
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:50.640] all
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.740] these
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.200] cells
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:52.700] until
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:52.840] it
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.020] hits
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.200] the
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.160] photoreceptors.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:54.900] Here
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.020] are
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:55.140] the
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.020] photoreceptors.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:56.520] And
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:56.720] at
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:56.960] the
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.940] closest
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.400] point
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:58.580] to
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:58.760] the
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.100] eye,
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:22:59.520] what
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:22:59.700] we
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.060] have
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:00.520] is
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.100] called
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:01.700] the
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.520] pigment
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.660] epithelium.
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:05.980] OK,
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:06.220] so
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:06.460] what's
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:06.640] the
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:06.940] pigment
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.760] epithelium?
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:08.540] The
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:08.860] pigment
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.520] epithelium
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:09.760] is
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:09.980] a
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:10.320] single
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:10.760] layer
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.100] of
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.120] cells
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:12.740] that
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:12.960] are
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.900] pigmented
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.620] to
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:14.920] such
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.080] a
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.560] degree
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.460] that
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:16.880] when
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.540] photons
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:17.860] come
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.100] into
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.360] the
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:18.760] eye
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.360] and
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:19.640] get
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:19.860] to
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.220] the
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.760] pigment
[00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:23.590] epithelium,
[00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.070] they
[00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.370] get
[00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.030] absorbed,
[00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.650] just
[00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.030] like
[00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.110] a
[00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.310] black
[00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.990] surface
[00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.670] that
[00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:28.810] you
[00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:28.970] see
[00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:29.090] as
[00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.210] a
[00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.430] black
[00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.030] surface
[00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.810] absorbs
[00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.330] the
[00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.810] photons
[00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:33.190] and
[00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.490] doesn't
[00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:33.890] reflect
[00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:34.130] them.
[00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.450] So
[00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:35.970] because
[00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:36.150] of
[00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:36.430] that,
[00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.430] there's
[00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.630] no
[00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:38.130] reflection
[00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:38.530] back
[00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.010] out.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.160] And
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.580] that
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.420] explains
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.360] why
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:43.620] the
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:43.960] pupil
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.360] looks
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:44.860] black,
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.780] because
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.160] the
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:49.420] light
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:49.600] that
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.540] comes
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:50.840] into
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.100] the
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:51.380] eye
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.340] doesn't
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:52.920] reflect
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.340] back
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:53.720] out.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.140] Now,
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:55.420] there's
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:55.520] a
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:55.680] good
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.020] reason
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.300] for
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:56.660] that,
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.440] because
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:57.640] if
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:57.800] it
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:57.940] were
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:58.100] to
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.560] reflect
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:58.900] back
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.320] out,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:23:59.980] it
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.120] would
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:00.600] scatter
[00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:01.220] and
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.380] it
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:01.540] would
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.180] activate
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.600] many
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.240] more
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.980] photoreceptors
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.220] than
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:06.380] it
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:06.800] should,
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:07.260] and
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:07.640] because
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:07.760] of
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:07.900] that,
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.000] you
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.180] get
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:08.700] blurred
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.100] vision.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:09.880] Now,
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.040] how
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:10.160] do
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.300] we
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:10.480] know
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:10.840] this?
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:11.960] All
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.160] right,
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:13.900] can
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:14.040] you
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.520] think
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.740] of
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.400] any
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:16.840] one
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.240] or
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.060] any
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.240] species
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:19.580] of
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:19.920] animal
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.600] where
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.480] the
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.720] pigment
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.420] epithelium
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:23.660] is
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:23.880] not
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.300] black?
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.080] Cat.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:28.280] OK,
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:28.440] in
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:28.820] cat.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:29.600] OK,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.120] so
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:30.300] there
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:30.460] are
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:30.740] some
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.520] animals
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.640] you
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:32.880] see
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.260] mostly
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:33.420] in
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:33.800] animals
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.380] that
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:34.860] specialize
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.160] in
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:35.800] nocturnal
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.180] vision
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:38.900] that
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.500] have
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.360] a
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:40.600] pigment
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.440] epithelium
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:41.920] which
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.360] actually
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:42.840] has
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.780] purposefully
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:44.620] reflecting
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:45.360] molecules
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:45.800] in
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.060] it.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.380] For
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.020] them,
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:48.260] this
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:48.420] is
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:48.660] called
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:48.980] actually
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.180] the
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:49.800] tapetum.
[00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:52.570] And
[00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.090] the
[00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.590] purpose
[00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.890] of
[00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:54.210] that
[00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:54.610] is
[00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:55.670] to
[00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:56.490] improve
[00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:56.670] your
[00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:56.990] ability
[00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.210] to
[00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:57.550] see
[00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.010] so
[00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.190] that
[00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.410] the
[00:24:58.410 --> 00:24:58.870] photons
[00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:59.870] activate
[00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:00.110] the
[00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.850] photoreceptors
[00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:01.050] not
[00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:01.250] only
[00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.370] in
[00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.550] one
[00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:01.970] direction,
[00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.430] but
[00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.710] also
[00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.950] when
[00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:03.170] they
[00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:03.870] bounce
[00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:04.330] back.
[00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.350] Now,
[00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.530] the
[00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.070] tapetum
[00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.250] is
[00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:06.650] arranged
[00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:06.830] in
[00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.110] such
[00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.270] a
[00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:07.430] way
[00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.530] in
[00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:07.770] most
[00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.150] animals
[00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:08.810] that
[00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:08.970] it
[00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:09.350] doesn't
[00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.710] freely
[00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:10.150] scatter
[00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:10.410] the
[00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:10.650] light,
[00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:11.050] but
[00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:11.790] scatters
[00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:11.890] it
[00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:12.010] in
[00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:12.090] a
[00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:12.270] fairly
[00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:12.870] directional
[00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:13.530] manner,
[00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:14.350] and
[00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.750] because
[00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.890] of
[00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:15.050] that,
[00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:15.210] you
[00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:15.370] can
[00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:15.570] see
[00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:15.850] pretty
[00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.150] well.
[00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:17.110] Now,
[00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.450] I'm
[00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:19.630] sure
[00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.810] that
[00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:20.030] many
[00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:20.230] of
[00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.350] you
[00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.550] have
[00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:21.050] noticed
[00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:21.610] that
[00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:21.790] when
[00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:21.930] you
[00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:22.270] drive
[00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:22.490] at
[00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.850] night
[00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.310] in
[00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.710] a
[00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:27.110] deserted
[00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.670] area
[00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.250] in
[00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:28.370] the
[00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.690] United
[00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:29.170] States,
[00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.530] which
[00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:29.690] are
[00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.150] decreasing,
[00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:30.450] of
[00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:30.690] course,
[00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.910] you
[00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:33.190] can
[00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.010] see
[00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.730] sometimes
[00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:36.750] deer
[00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.810] on
[00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:37.970] the
[00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:38.350] highway,
[00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:39.330] or
[00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:39.730] rabbits
[00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:39.910] for
[00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:40.130] that
[00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.390] matter.
[00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.550] And
[00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:41.890] when
[00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:42.030] you
[00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:42.310] see
[00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.590] them,
[00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.270] it
[00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:43.490] looks
[00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.710] like
[00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.830] they
[00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.970] have
[00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:44.450] two
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.420] flashlights
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.500] projecting
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:47.960] at
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.160] you.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.160] It's
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:49.400] almost
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:49.860] scary,
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:50.900] but
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.060] it
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:51.360] also
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:51.900] helps
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.420] you
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:53.400] by
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.180] being
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:54.380] able
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:54.600] to
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.020] avoid
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:55.400] hitting
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:55.700] them.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:56.580] Now,
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:56.960] that's
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.360] because
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:57.600] they
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:57.800] have
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.020] that
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:58.620] reflecting
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.300] tapetum.
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.320] Let's
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:01.520] look
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:01.620] at
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:01.760] a
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.040] different
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.620] example.
[00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:03.910] What
[00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:04.370] other
[00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:05.390] human
[00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.710] can
[00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.870] you
[00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.230] think
[00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.570] of
[00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.570] who
[00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.670] does
[00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:08.910] not
[00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:09.110] have
[00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.290] a
[00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:09.590] black
[00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.150] pigment
[00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:10.930] epithelium?
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:12.720] Or
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:12.940] for
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:13.440] that
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:13.720] matter,
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:14.280] some
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:14.680] animals
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:14.920] as
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.060] well.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:15.380] Yes?
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.460] Very
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:16.780] good.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:17.800] Albinos.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:18.760] Now,
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:19.020] what's
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.620] albinos?
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.540] Albinos
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.020] are
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.740] individuals
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.020] or
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:22.500] animals
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:23.780] who
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.300] lack
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.460] pigment
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.760] in
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.020] their
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:28.440] skin
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.120] and,
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:29.440] of
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:29.700] course,
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:30.960] in
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.380] their
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.300] retinae.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:32.780] So
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.020] if
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:33.140] you
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:33.400] look
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:33.860] at
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.260] the
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:36.680] eye
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.820] of
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.280] an
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:38.920] albino,
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.140] actually,
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:40.540] their
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:40.860] pupil
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:41.120] is
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.380] not
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:41.900] black.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:42.560] Their
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:42.880] pupil
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.520] is
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.840] reddish.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:46.440] Very
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:46.640] good.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:47.260] Why
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:47.420] is
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:47.580] it
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.000] reddish?
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:48.940] Because
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.660] you
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.040] have
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.440] thousands
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.100] of,
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:56.900] in
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.500] the
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:57.820] retina,
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:26:59.480] especially
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.080] mostly
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.320] on
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:00.440] the
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:00.780] outside
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.140] here
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:01.340] as
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:01.600] well,
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:03.420] you
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:03.780] have
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.520] blood
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.160] vessels.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:06.820] And
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:06.960] the
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.180] blood
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:07.540] vessels,
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:07.800] since
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:07.940] they
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.220] carry
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:08.720] blood,
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.260] when
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:10.860] light
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.280] reflects
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.520] from
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:11.720] them,
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.160] they
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:12.320] will
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:12.560] have
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:12.760] a
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.220] reddish
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:13.640] color
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:13.880] to
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.100] them
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:14.600] and
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.000] thereby
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.780] endow,
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.020] if
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:16.200] you
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.500] will,
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.260] the
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.420] pupil
[00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:20.810] with
[00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:21.010] a
[00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:21.410] reddish
[00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:21.990] color.
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:23.280] Now,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:23.500] the
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:23.980] proof
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.760] that
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:24.940] the
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:25.240] main
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:25.780] function
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:26.020] of
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:26.320] the
[00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.710] pigment
[00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:28.390] epithelium
[00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:28.610] is
[00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.770] to
[00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:29.350] absorb
[00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.750] the
[00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.090] incoming
[00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:30.630] light
[00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.070] to
[00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.470] prevent
[00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.130] scattering
[00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:32.850] is
[00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:32.950] in
[00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:33.090] the
[00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:33.390] fact
[00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:33.930] that
[00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:34.850] albinos
[00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.930] that
[00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:36.310] lack
[00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.530] this
[00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:36.830] pigment
[00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:37.550] epithelium
[00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.290] have
[00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:39.070] very
[00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.430] poor
[00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.870] vision.
[00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:41.070] They
[00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.410] often
[00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:41.630] have
[00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.990] vision
[00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.370] 20
[00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:43.570] over
[00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:44.090] 200
[00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.390] or
[00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.810] something
[00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:45.870] because
[00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:46.590] the
[00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:46.870] light
[00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:47.750] scatters
[00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:48.450] from
[00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.050] the
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.840] epithelium,
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:51.100] which
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.240] is
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:51.420] no
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:51.640] longer
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.180] pigmented
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:52.460] in
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:52.640] these
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.580] people,
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.260] and
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:54.940] activates
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.800] many
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.040] photoreceptors,
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:58.760] thereby
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.640] reducing
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:27:59.840] your
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.180] ability
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:00.780] to
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.100] see
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:01.420] things
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:01.800] clearly
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.160] and
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.540] sharply.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.120] All
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:04.300] right,
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:04.480] so
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:04.720] now
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.240] let's
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.840] go
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.140] through
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:06.740] this
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.180] retina
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:07.560] here.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.280] First
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:08.520] of
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:08.780] all,
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:09.400] we
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:09.800] have
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.240] the
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:10.600] rods
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:10.920] and
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.120] the
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:11.500] cones.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:13.760] Now,
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.240] this
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:15.560] brings
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:15.780] me
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.100] to
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.580] a
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:16.840] very
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.340] interesting
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:17.880] story,
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.100] at
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:18.280] least
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:18.500] for
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:18.680] me
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:18.800] an
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.160] interesting
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:19.660] story.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.240] Back
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:22.480] in
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.060] the
[00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.130] 19th
[00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.670] century,
[00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.470] there
[00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.630] was
[00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.830] a
[00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:27.290] person
[00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:27.790] whose
[00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.130] name
[00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.490] was
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:35.240] Max
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:35.960] Schulze.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.420] I'm
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:36.600] trying
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:36.720] to
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.100] remember
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:37.380] when
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:37.820] he
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.280] lived.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:38.940] He
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.340] lived
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:41.020] from
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:41.940] 1825
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.420] to
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.020] 1874.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.600] He
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.260] developed
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:46.940] some
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.440] new
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.820] anatomical
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.460] procedures.
[00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:51.050] And
[00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:51.350] as
[00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.530] I
[00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:51.850] mentioned
[00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:52.370] before,
[00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.770] whenever
[00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:54.650] new
[00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:55.330] techniques
[00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.510] emerge
[00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:57.170] or
[00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:57.250] are
[00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:57.730] invented,
[00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.050] it's
[00:28:59.050 --> 00:28:59.450] likely
[00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.850] that
[00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.070] you're
[00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.130] going
[00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:00.230] to
[00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.450] make
[00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:00.670] some
[00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:01.450] interesting
[00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:01.770] new
[00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:02.290] discoveries.
[00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:03.490] And
[00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:03.690] so
[00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:03.930] he
[00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:04.170] was
[00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:04.350] the
[00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.710] first
[00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.290] person,
[00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:06.390] by
[00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:07.630] then
[00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:08.750] looking
[00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:09.170] at
[00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:09.510] the
[00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.030] retina
[00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:11.430] and
[00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.710] looking
[00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.910] at
[00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:12.070] the
[00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.970] photoreceptors,
[00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.470] that
[00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.630] he
[00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.070] said,
[00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:15.250] my
[00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:15.570] god,
[00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:15.750] there
[00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.870] are
[00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:16.050] two
[00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:16.410] different
[00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:16.730] kinds
[00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.890] of
[00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:17.270] cones.
[00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:18.550] I
[00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:18.790] shouldn't
[00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:18.970] say
[00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:19.210] cones.
[00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:19.410] Two
[00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:19.790] different
[00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.310] kinds
[00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.450] of
[00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.310] photoreceptors,
[00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:21.730] the
[00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:22.150] rods
[00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:22.930] and
[00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:23.150] the
[00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:23.590] cones.
[00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.190] The
[00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.570] rods
[00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.750] were
[00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.970] sort
[00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:27.070] of
[00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.270] like
[00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:27.430] the
[00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.670] name
[00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:28.210] implies
[00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:28.970] rods,
[00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.710] and
[00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.950] the
[00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:30.250] cones
[00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:30.470] were
[00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.730] sort
[00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:30.990] of,
[00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.890] as
[00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:32.010] the
[00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:32.210] name
[00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.630] implies,
[00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.050] cone
[00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:33.270]-ish
[00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:33.650] looking.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:35.260] So
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:35.440] he
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:35.740] looked
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:35.900] at
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.100] that
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.240] and
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.480] looked
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:36.640] at
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:36.740] that
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:36.820] and
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:36.960] said,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.140] my
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:37.480] god,
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:37.780] why
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:37.960] on
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.360] earth
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:38.780] would
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:38.960] we
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.340] have
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.020] in
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.900] most
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.020] animals
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.440] rods
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:42.960] and
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.360] cones?
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:43.600] What
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:43.760] is
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:43.920] their
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.360] function?
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.060] This
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:45.220] was
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:45.360] a
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:45.660] totally
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:45.880] new
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.400] discovery.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.000] And
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.120] when
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:47.240] he
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:47.540] first
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.040] published
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:48.340] this,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:48.840] nobody
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.360] believed
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:49.580] him.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:50.460] They
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:50.640] said,
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:50.800] oh,
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:50.980] they
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:51.220] just
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:51.600] vary
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.160] randomly,
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:52.520] and
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:52.780] some
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:52.980] are
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.380] more
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:54.700] rod
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:54.960]-like,
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:55.100] and
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:55.560] some
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:55.700] are
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:55.880] more
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.260] cone
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:56.600]-like.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.000] But
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.200] it's
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:57.420] just
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:57.820] the
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.080] same
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:58.980] photoreceptors.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:00.680] So
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.200] he,
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:01.420] of
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:01.580] course,
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:01.820] did
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.020] not
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.440] accept
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:02.620] that.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:02.880] He
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.840] saw,
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:04.220] by
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:04.460] being
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:04.780] very
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.160] careful
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.480] about
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:05.680] it,
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.100] that
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:06.240] it
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:06.420] was
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:06.700] two
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.600] definitely
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.060] different
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:08.600] classes,
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.140] just
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:09.380] like
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:09.500] it
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:09.640] is
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:09.780] in
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.000] this
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.340] picture.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.160] And
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:12.340] so
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:12.540] he
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:12.880] began
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.060] to
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:13.360] ask
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:13.500] the
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:13.860] question,
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.480] why
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:14.680] on
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:14.900] earth
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.060] do
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:15.200] we
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.480] have
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:15.820] this?
[00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:16.910] So
[00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:17.370] imagine
[00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.050] yourself
[00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:18.770] in
[00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:18.910] the
[00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:19.370] 19th
[00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:19.810] century
[00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.450] coming
[00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.710] up
[00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.850] with
[00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:21.030] this
[00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:21.490] incredible
[00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.190] discovery
[00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:22.950] and
[00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:23.150] trying
[00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:23.310] to
[00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.530] figure
[00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:23.770] out
[00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:24.130] why
[00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:24.350] we
[00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.590] have
[00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.790] them.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:26.620] Now,
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:26.840] if
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:26.980] you're
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:27.060] a
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:27.220] really
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:27.560] good
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.160] scientist,
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.020] then
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.160] you
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.460] start
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:29.640] to
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:29.920] think
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.700] analytically.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.380] And
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:31.620] so
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:31.860] what
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:32.020] did
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:32.220] he
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:32.520] do?
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.080] I'm
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.320] so
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:34.720] impressed
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:34.940] to
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.140] this
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:35.380] day.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.120] He
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:36.540] said,
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:36.940] well,
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.120] let
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:37.220] me
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:37.460] take
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:37.620] a
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:37.920] closer
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.340] look
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:38.600] at
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.080] the
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:39.460] retina
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:39.940] and
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.340] see
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:40.900] how
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.280] the
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.140] rods
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:42.320] and
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:42.520] the
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:42.860] cones
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.300] are
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:43.920] distributed
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.440] on
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:45.580] the
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:45.800] retinal
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.260] surface.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.140] And
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:47.340] he
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:47.920] discovered,
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:48.700] to
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:48.880] go
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.200] back
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.440] to
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:49.760] the
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.340] previous
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.040] slide,
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.020] that
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:53.200] there
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:53.320] is
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:53.460] a
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:53.740] small
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.180] region
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:54.640] here,
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:55.300] the
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:55.980] fovea,
[00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:57.230] where
[00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.490] there
[00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:57.670] are
[00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:58.230] only
[00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.010] cones.
[00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.590] There
[00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.650] are
[00:30:59.650 --> 00:30:59.830] no
[00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:00.270] rods.
[00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:00.930] And
[00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:01.050] I'll
[00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:01.230] show
[00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.330] you
[00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:01.450] a
[00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:01.590] better
[00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.930] picture
[00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:02.050] of
[00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:02.170] that
[00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:02.290] in
[00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:02.410] a
[00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:02.550] minute.
[00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:03.910] And
[00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:04.010] he
[00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.290] said,
[00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:04.750] my
[00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:05.210] god,
[00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.310] if
[00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:07.210] that's
[00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:07.390] the
[00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:07.850] case,
[00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:08.310] there
[00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.510] must
[00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:08.670] be
[00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:09.090] something
[00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:09.770] different
[00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:10.290] about
[00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:10.510] the
[00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:10.710] way
[00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.870] we
[00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:11.070] see
[00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.150] in
[00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:11.350] the
[00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.970] fovea
[00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:12.610] than
[00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:12.810] we
[00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:13.070] can
[00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.510] see
[00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:13.990] in
[00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.410] areas
[00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:14.650] where
[00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:14.850] you
[00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:15.130] have
[00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.170] lots
[00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:16.330] of
[00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:16.690] rods.
[00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.710] So
[00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.890] what
[00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:18.030] did
[00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:18.170] he
[00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:18.610] discover?
[00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.450] He
[00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.150] discovered
[00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.470] that
[00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:22.650] in
[00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:22.910] the
[00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:23.890] fovea,
[00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:24.690] we
[00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:24.990] don't
[00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.230] see
[00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.470] too
[00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.850] well
[00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:26.630] at
[00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:27.010] night.
[00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:28.890] And
[00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:29.070] on
[00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.110] the
[00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.410] basis
[00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:29.690] of
[00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:30.090] that,
[00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:30.550] he
[00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.190] concluded
[00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.230] that
[00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.990] the
[00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.310] rods
[00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.470] are
[00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.650] for
[00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:34.950] night
[00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:35.310] vision.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:36.980] Now,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.180] this
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:37.500] was
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.200] absolutely
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:38.780] incredible.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:40.480] There's
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:40.660] only
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.040] one
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.520] sad
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:41.840] part
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.040] in
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:42.260] this
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:42.680] story,
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.380] which
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:43.680] is
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.300] that
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:44.580] this
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.100] discovery
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:45.420] was
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:45.840] made
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.760] in
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:47.720] the
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.180] early
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.380] 19th
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:50.980] century
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.080] before
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:53.640] the
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:53.880] Nobel
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.320] Prize
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:54.560] was
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.140] initiated.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.620] Because
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.180] had
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.360] the
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:58.600] Nobel
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:58.900] Prize
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:31:59.080] been
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:31:59.500] initiated
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:31:59.900] before
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.080] he
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:00.240] made
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:00.420] this
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:00.920] discovery,
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:01.580] there's
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:01.760] no
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.320] question
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:02.680] that
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:02.840] he
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.000] would
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.120] have
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.480] received
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:03.660] the
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:03.860] Nobel
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.240] Prize
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:04.460] for
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:04.740] it.
[00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:06.510] It's
[00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:06.690] such
[00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:06.930] an
[00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:07.690] incredible
[00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:08.150] magnitude
[00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:08.430] of
[00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.910] discovery.
[00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:09.730] All
[00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:09.890] right,
[00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:10.070] so
[00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.330] let's
[00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:10.470] go
[00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.770] back
[00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:11.010] here
[00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:11.290] then.
[00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:11.790] And
[00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:11.950] I
[00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:12.230] pointed
[00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.530] out
[00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:12.750] the
[00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:13.390] rods
[00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:13.530] and
[00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:13.690] the
[00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:13.950] cones
[00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:14.090] and
[00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.210] the
[00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.450] pigment
[00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:15.150] epithelium.
[00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:15.730] Now
[00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:15.990] let's
[00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.130] go
[00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.410] through
[00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:16.830] here,
[00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.810] and
[00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:17.950] I'll
[00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:18.150] tell
[00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:18.250] you
[00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:18.470] about
[00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.610] the
[00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:18.810] rest
[00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:18.930] of
[00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:19.030] the
[00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.470] elements.
[00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:20.350] And
[00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.610] then
[00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:21.490] this
[00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:21.770] time
[00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:21.910] and
[00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:22.330] also
[00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:23.090] in
[00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.350] several
[00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.850] subsequent
[00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:24.470] sessions,
[00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.850] we
[00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:24.970] will
[00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:25.230] talk
[00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.530] about
[00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:25.830] some
[00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.950] of
[00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:26.250] these
[00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:26.990] elements
[00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.310] in
[00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.510] much
[00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:27.750] more
[00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:28.190] detail,
[00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.090] especially
[00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.070] about
[00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.810] the
[00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:31.690] retinal
[00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:32.090] ganglion
[00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.510] cells.
[00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:32.970] So
[00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:33.390] anyway,
[00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:33.930] when
[00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:34.050] you
[00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:34.310] come
[00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.570] here
[00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:34.710] to
[00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.910] the
[00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:35.170] next
[00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:35.810] stage
[00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:36.670] here,
[00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.550] we
[00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:37.630] have
[00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:37.790] the
[00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:38.050] so
[00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:38.230]-called
[00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.910] horizontal
[00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:39.510] cells
[00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:39.910] and
[00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:40.430] bipolar
[00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.930] cells.
[00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.290] It's
[00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:41.390] been
[00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:41.930] established
[00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:42.350] that
[00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.510] the
[00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.430] photoreceptors
[00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.930] connect
[00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.490] with
[00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:45.850] both
[00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:46.050] of
[00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:46.390] these.
[00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.210] And
[00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.590] then
[00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.110] the
[00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.590] bipolar
[00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.110] cells
[00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.910] connect
[00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:50.670] into
[00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:50.990] the
[00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.330] inner
[00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:51.710] portion
[00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.870] of
[00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.990] the
[00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.230] retina,
[00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:52.550] just
[00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:52.770] as
[00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:53.070] I'll
[00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.270] show
[00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:53.370] you
[00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:53.470] in
[00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.590] a
[00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.730] minute.
[00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:54.370] Now
[00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:54.650] this
[00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:55.070] region
[00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.630] here
[00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:56.250] is
[00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:56.550] called
[00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:56.770] the
[00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:57.550] OPL,
[00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:58.610] and
[00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.850] that's
[00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:59.030] easy
[00:32:59.030 --> 00:32:59.210] to
[00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.610] remember,
[00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:00.130] outer
[00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:00.810] plexiform
[00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:01.170] layer.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:02.520] Now
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:02.760] then
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:02.920] when
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.060] you
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.220] get
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:03.440] into
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:03.640] the
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:03.900] deeper
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.320] parts
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:04.460] of
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:04.600] the
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:04.940] retina,
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:05.440] you
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:05.580] have
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:05.720] the
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:05.900] so
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:06.100]-called
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:06.720] amacrine

[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:08.940] cells.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.620] And
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:09.920] they
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.460] reside
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:10.640] in
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:10.820] the

[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:13.390] Now
[00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:13.590] it
[00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.730] is
[00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.970] the

[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.560] and
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:21.800] then
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.320] project,
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:22.580] as

[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.400] in
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:29.580] the

[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:30.940] most
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.400] notably
[00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:32.480] that
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:32.700] we're
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:32.760] going
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:32.840] to
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.040] talk
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:33.300] about
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:33.700] today,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:34.700] the

[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.520] geniculate
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:35.980] nucleus.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:39.640] Now
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:39.820] let
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:40.160] me
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:40.840] also
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.180] point
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:41.400] out
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:41.560] at
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:41.780] this
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.180] stage,
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:42.380] let
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:42.480] me
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:42.660] see,
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:42.820] do
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:42.920] I
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.060] have
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:43.160] a
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:43.420] picture
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:43.640] of
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:43.900] that,
[00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:48.810] I'll
[00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:49.030] point
[00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:49.310] out
[00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.490] to
[00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.690] you
[00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:50.330] some
[00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.870] numbers.
[00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:51.710] Here
[00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.910] is
[00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:52.050] an

[00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:55.510] of
[00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:55.970] rods.
[00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:56.850] Now
[00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:57.050] the
[00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:57.490] rods
[00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:58.970] are
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.360] constructed
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.000] in
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.160] an

[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:02.680] They
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.040] have
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.520] these
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.240] individual

[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:04.800]-called
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.340] disks.
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.200] And
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:06.440] within
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:06.820] each
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:06.960] of
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:07.180] these

[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:09.760] of
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:09.860] them.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.100] I
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:10.280] only
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:10.480] have
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.080] 25
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:11.260] here,
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:11.400] I
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:11.600] think,
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:11.720] or
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.140] 24.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:12.820] There
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:12.840] are

[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:14.780] each
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:15.600] rod,
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.120] OK?
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:17.340] And
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:17.780] within
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.460] each
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:18.660] of
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.180] these
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.340] disks,
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.060] you
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:21.240] have
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:21.660] about

[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:25.780] There
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.200] are
[00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.830] several
[00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.190] kinds
[00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.490] of
[00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:29.130] opsins,
[00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:29.470] so
[00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.850]-called.
[00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.870] Rhodopsins
[00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:31.050] are
[00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:31.170] the
[00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:31.410] ones
[00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:31.610] that
[00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:31.730] you

[00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.250] in
[00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:32.670] rods.
[00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:33.170] Then
[00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:33.330] there
[00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:33.350] are

[00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:37.170] And
[00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:37.530] these
[00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:37.730] are

[00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.210] so
[00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:45.470] that
[00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.650] when
[00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:46.210] a

[00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.810] with
[00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:49.090] and
[00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:49.370] hits
[00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:49.570] one
[00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:49.710] of
[00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:50.090] these
[00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.770] molecules,

[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:19.760] the
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.120] easiest
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.300] way
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:20.440] to
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:20.700] think
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:20.840] of
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.000] them
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.400] is
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:21.560] that
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:21.680] they
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:21.820] are
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:22.240] bleached
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:22.740] or
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.460] unbleached.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.000] And
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:24.180] so
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:24.420] there
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:24.920] are
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.220] millions
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:25.440] of
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:25.620] these
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.220] molecules.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.340] And
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:28.900] what
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.020] is
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:29.140] that,
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:29.340] 10
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:29.640] million

[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:30.420] eye,
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:31.720] sorry,
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:31.920] in
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.480] each
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:32.940] rod.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:33.920] And
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.060] you
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:34.120] know
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.280] how
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:34.460] many
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:34.740] rods
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.000] there
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.160] are
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:35.780] in
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:35.920] the
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.220] average
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:36.820] eye?
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:37.600] About
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.340] 120
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.220] million,
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.440] OK?
[00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.950] And
[00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:42.330] about
[00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:42.790] 5
[00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.890] or
[00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:43.210] 6
[00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:43.690] million
[00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:44.110] cones.
[00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:44.970] I
[00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:45.070] mean,
[00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:45.170] you're
[00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.350] talking
[00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:45.590] about
[00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:46.210] unbelievable
[00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:46.750] numbers.
[00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:47.010] It's
[00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:47.270] just
[00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.990] hard
[00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.170] to
[00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.510] comprehend.
[00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:49.290] But
[00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:49.430] at
[00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.690] any
[00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:50.030] rate,
[00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.730] the
[00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:51.190] molecules
[00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.610] here
[00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:52.230] then
[00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.690] are
[00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:52.890] in
[00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:53.150] two
[00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.950] different
[00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:55.730] states,
[00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.450] bleached
[00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.670] and
[00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:57.210] unbleached.
[00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.810] What
[00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:58.130] that
[00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.550] means
[00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:59.050] is
[00:35:59.050 --> 00:35:59.730] when
[00:35:59.730 --> 00:35:59.970] a
[00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:00.290] molecule
[00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.930] shifts
[00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:01.510] from
[00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.830] being
[00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:02.430] unbleached
[00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:02.650] to
[00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:02.970] bleached
[00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:03.170] as
[00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.270] a
[00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.570] result
[00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:03.750] of
[00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.930] a
[00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:04.210] photon
[00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:04.590] hitting
[00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:04.950] it,
[00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:06.610] that
[00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:07.210] changes
[00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:08.230] the
[00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.450] overall,
[00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:12.630] I'm
[00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.130] talking
[00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.390] about,
[00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:13.770] of
[00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:13.910] course,
[00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.250] hundreds
[00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:14.450] of
[00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.750] molecules
[00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.250] typically,
[00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.870] the
[00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:17.770] overall
[00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:18.230] degree
[00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.690] of
[00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.370] de
[00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.450]-
[00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:19.610] and
[00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:20.650] hyperpolarization
[00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:20.930] of
[00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:21.110] the
[00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:21.450] cell.
[00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:22.190] And
[00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.510] that
[00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:22.770] will
[00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:23.030] then
[00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.630] determine
[00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.230] whether
[00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.550] this
[00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.850] cell
[00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:25.010] is
[00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.130] going
[00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.290] to
[00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:25.810] communicate
[00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:26.090] the
[00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:26.390] next
[00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.830] elements
[00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:27.170] below.
[00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:27.610] And
[00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:28.170] I'll
[00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:28.470] describe
[00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.650] that
[00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:28.770] in
[00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:28.970] much
[00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:29.150] more
[00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.390] detail
[00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.650] in
[00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:29.870] just
[00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:30.010] a
[00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.190] minute.
[00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.130] But
[00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.630] it
[00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.910] gives
[00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:32.030] you
[00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.190] an
[00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.490] idea
[00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:32.670] of
[00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.870] how
[00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:33.530] unbelievably
[00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:34.510] complex
[00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.830] this
[00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:35.190] is.
[00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.770] Yet
[00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:36.090] another
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:36.670] complexity
[00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.050] is
[00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:37.450] that
[00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:37.570] you
[00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:37.750] have
[00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.930] this
[00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:38.190] huge
[00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.510] number
[00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.890] of
[00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:39.310] rods,
[00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.470] OK?
[00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:41.730] But
[00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:43.550] if
[00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.650] you
[00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:43.870] think
[00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:44.170] about
[00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:44.450] it,
[00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:44.670] would
[00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.910] these
[00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:45.270] rods
[00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.490] be
[00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:45.810] there
[00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:45.930] in
[00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:46.450] each,
[00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.770] sorry,
[00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.990] disks
[00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.190] in
[00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.950] these
[00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:51.390] rods?
[00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:51.970] Would
[00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:52.190] each
[00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.350] of
[00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:52.670] these
[00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.330] disks
[00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.350] persist
[00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:55.570] for
[00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:55.710] a
[00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.150] lifetime?
[00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:58.330] Say
[00:36:58.330 --> 00:36:58.490] the
[00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:58.710] average
[00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:59.130] lifetime
[00:36:59.130 --> 00:36:59.330] is
[00:36:59.330 --> 00:36:59.550] 80
[00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.710] or
[00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.930] 90
[00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:00.370] years.
[00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:01.530] Would
[00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:01.830] these
[00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:02.390] same
[00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:03.270] guys
[00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:04.810] exist
[00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:04.990] in
[00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.110] the
[00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:05.290] eye
[00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:05.470] all
[00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.610] the
[00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:05.850] time?
[00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:06.370] Well,
[00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.530] the
[00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.790] answer
[00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:07.010] is
[00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.290] no.
[00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:07.770] What
[00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:08.230] happens
[00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.530] is
[00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:08.970] there's
[00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:09.130] yet
[00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:09.470] another
[00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:10.150] process,
[00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:10.670] amazingly,
[00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.590] that
[00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.230] replaces
[00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.910] in
[00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:14.470] steps
[00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.310] these
[00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:17.290] disks
[00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.030] in
[00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.210] the

[00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:21.710] Usually
[00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.910] a
[00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:22.090] few
[00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:22.470] disks
[00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.750] every
[00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.990] few
[00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.410] days.
[00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:24.250] So
[00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:24.450] it's
[00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:24.590] a
[00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:24.970] constant
[00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:25.550] dynamic
[00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.270] process
[00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:27.150] keeping
[00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.070] your
[00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.730] rods,
[00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.490] if
[00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.670] not
[00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.830] your
[00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:32.030] whole
[00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.450] body,
[00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:33.450] young,
[00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.950] so
[00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:34.150] to
[00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.570] speak.
[00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:35.570] All
[00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:35.810] right.
[00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:36.110] So
[00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:36.430] anyway,
[00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.810] this
[00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:37.230] gives
[00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.370] you
[00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.510] sort
[00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.590] of
[00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:37.730] a
[00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.930] crude
[00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:38.250] sense
[00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:38.370] of
[00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:38.510] a
[00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.930] complexity
[00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:39.290] of
[00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.470] this
[00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.910] system.
[00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:41.530] But
[00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:41.830] now
[00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:41.970] we
[00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:42.090] are
[00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:42.230] going
[00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.390] to
[00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.710] shift
[00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.250] over
[00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.130] and
[00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:44.590] talk
[00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:45.490] about
[00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:46.250] the
[00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:49.090] retinoganglion
[00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:49.670] cells.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.380] And
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:51.620] then
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:51.820] we'll
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:52.000] come
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.300] back
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:52.420] and
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:52.600] we'll
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:52.820] talk
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:53.180] about
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:53.580] in
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:53.800] a
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:53.920] bit
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.160] more
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:54.580] detail
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.340] about
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:55.600] the
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.580] pre
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.520]-retinoganglionic
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:57.860] elements.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:58.820] Here
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:37:59.040] is
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:37:59.300] a
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:37:59.920] set
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:00.140] of
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:00.740] pictures
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.360] created
[00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:02.950] by
[00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:03.110] a
[00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:03.390] wonderful
[00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:04.550] scientist
[00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.950] called
[00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:05.470] Poyak
[00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:06.830] showing
[00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:07.090] you
[00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:07.470] different
[00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.090] classes
[00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:08.910] of
[00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:09.770] types,
[00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:10.410] if
[00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:10.570] you
[00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:10.790] will,
[00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:11.310] of

[00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:12.570] cells.
[00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:13.050] The

[00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.170] row
[00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:14.710] here
[00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:15.910] had

[00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:16.570] named
[00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:16.950] because
[00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:17.250] of
[00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:17.410] their

[00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.670] arbors
[00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:20.170] had

[00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:23.570] OK?
[00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:25.730] Whereas
[00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:26.290] these
[00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:26.670] ones
[00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.150] below,
[00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:28.310] some

[00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.570] them
[00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:28.750] at
[00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:29.030] least,
[00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.850] are

[00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:30.850] and
[00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:30.990] are

[00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:32.910] as
[00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.050] you
[00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.190] can
[00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.470] see
[00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.790] here,
[00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.330] have
[00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:34.510] been
[00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.810] called
[00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:35.470] parasol
[00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:35.890] cells.
[00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.330] And
[00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:36.570] why
[00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:36.830] they've
[00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:36.970] been
[00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:37.250] called
[00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.930] parasol
[00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:38.230] cells
[00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.490] I'll
[00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:38.810] explain
[00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.990] to
[00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.110] you
[00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:39.230] in
[00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.450] just
[00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:39.610] a
[00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:39.770] minute.
[00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:40.770] OK.
[00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.290] Now
[00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:41.710] this
[00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.230] set
[00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.410] of
[00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:43.750] pictures
[00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:44.350] was
[00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:44.790] created
[00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.210] by
[00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.090] the
[00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:46.810] Golgi
[00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:47.210] stain
[00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.410] that
[00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:47.550] I
[00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.850] mentioned
[00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.090] to
[00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:48.270] you
[00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.770] before.
[00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:49.950] That
[00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:50.410] was
[00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.230] invented
[00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.090] by
[00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:52.770] Golgi
[00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:53.830] and
[00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:54.490] extensively
[00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:55.210] studied
[00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.530] by
[00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:57.070] Cajal.
[00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.950] And
[00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:58.170] for
[00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:58.370] this
[00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.870] incredible
[00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:59.250] work
[00:38:59.250 --> 00:38:59.370] they
[00:38:59.370 --> 00:38:59.530] had
[00:38:59.530 --> 00:38:59.790] done,
[00:38:59.830 --> 00:38:59.910] a
[00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:00.010] lot
[00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:00.110] of
[00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:00.230] it
[00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.370] on
[00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:00.510] the
[00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.850] retina,
[00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:02.090] they
[00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:02.630] received
[00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.810] the
[00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:03.030] Nobel
[00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.490] Prize
[00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:04.030] in
[00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.090] 1906.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:06.780] So
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.020] what
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:07.300] this
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.020] disclosed
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:08.400] then,
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:09.480] an
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:09.840] initial
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.300] view,
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.140] was
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:11.760] that
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:11.920] there
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.020] are
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:12.360] different
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.160] classes
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:13.500] of
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.280] retinoganglion
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:14.780] cells.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:15.260] And
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:15.400] so
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:15.700] therefore,
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:15.940] the
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.160] big
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:16.520] question
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:16.800] came
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.040] up,
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:17.600] why
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:17.760] do
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:17.920] we
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.120] have
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:18.420] different
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:18.800] classes
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.040] of
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.420] cells
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:19.860] like
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.000] the
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:20.720] retinoganglion
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.120] cells?
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:21.800] What
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:21.920] do
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.080] they
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:22.340] do?
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:23.480] Well,
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:23.820] initially
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.120] some
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.420] people,
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:24.900] again,
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:25.580] which
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:25.740] is
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:25.980] good,
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:26.380] I
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:26.560] think
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:26.740] one
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:26.900] should
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:27.080] be
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:27.560] resistant
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:27.820] to
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.200] change
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:28.340] in
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:28.500] new
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:28.920] ideas
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.240] until
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:29.460] they
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:29.600] are
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:29.820] really
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:30.680] proven
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.020] well.
[00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:35.630] Some
[00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.910] people
[00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:36.250] argued
[00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:36.450] that,
[00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.630] ah,
[00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.730] it's
[00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:36.910] just
[00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:37.070] this
[00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:37.570] continuum.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:38.740] But
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:38.920] then
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.060] it
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:39.400] became
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:39.760] evident
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.660] that
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.100] these
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:42.300] are
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:42.740] indeed
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.200] different
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:43.740] classes.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:44.460] And
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:44.600] I
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:44.760] will
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.080] present
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:45.380] some
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:45.700] evidence
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.120] to
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.340] prove
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:47.680] that.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.260] So
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:48.480] there
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:48.580] are
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:48.900] actually
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:49.220] quite
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:49.420] a
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:49.740] number
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:49.920] of
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.140] different
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.660] classes
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:50.840] of
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.500] retinoganglion
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:51.880] cells
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.080] that
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:52.440] perform
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:52.780] different
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.320] jobs.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:53.940] We're
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:54.000] going
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.080] to
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:54.260] try
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:54.440] to
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:54.920] understand
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.200] what
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:55.500] are
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:55.640] the
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:55.920] different
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.240] jobs
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:56.420] they
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:56.860] perform.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:57.660] And
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:57.820] we're
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:57.920] going
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.060] to
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:58.500] concentrate
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.080] mostly
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:39:59.860] on
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.120] these
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:00.720] midget
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.780] and
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:02.580] parasol
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.160] cells,
[00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.670] because
[00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.850] they
[00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:04.910] are
[00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:05.030] by
[00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.510] far
[00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.750] the
[00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:06.010] most
[00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:06.370] numerous
[00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.130] in
[00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.530] the
[00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:07.870] retina
[00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:08.810] and
[00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:09.570] make
[00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:09.770] a
[00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:10.210] major,
[00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:10.490] major
[00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:11.190] contribution
[00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.550] to
[00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:11.870] oral
[00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:12.350] vision.
[00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:13.370] All
[00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.530] right,
[00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:13.730] so
[00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:14.110] now
[00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.310] let's
[00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.030] look
[00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.270] at
[00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.470] the
[00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.190] physiology
[00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.050] of
[00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.910] retinoganglion
[00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:19.310] cells.
[00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.690] Now
[00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:19.870] that
[00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:20.010] we
[00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:20.150] know
[00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.330] we
[00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:20.470] have
[00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.650] these
[00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:20.890] different
[00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:21.150] kinds
[00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.290] of
[00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:21.630] ganglion
[00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.070] cells,
[00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:23.070] how
[00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:23.270] do
[00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.490] we
[00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.190] find
[00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.390] out
[00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.590] what
[00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:24.770] they
[00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:25.010] do?
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.260] Well,
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:26.840] what
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.040] was
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.880] recognized
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.780] in
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:29.900] the
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.140] early
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:30.640] portions
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:30.960] of
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.520] the
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.380] 20th
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:32.940] century,
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:33.780] that
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:33.980] to
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.360] find
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:34.760] out
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.360] what
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:35.620] these
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.160] cells
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.100] do,
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:38.740] one
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.420] needs
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:39.720] to
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.840] study
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.160] their
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:41.860] activity.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:42.620] And
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:42.780] to
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:43.080] study
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:43.340] their
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:43.940] activity,
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:44.640] what
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:44.960] was
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.600] developed
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.700] after
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.220] many
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.640] different
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.240] trials
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:49.840] is
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.140] to
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:50.960] either
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.400] record
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:51.600] from
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.340] individual
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.160] exons
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.060] or
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:54.240] to
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:54.420] use
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:54.600] a
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.680] microelectrode
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.080] that
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:56.200] you
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:56.380] could
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:56.620] put
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:56.880] into
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.160] the
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:57.540] eye
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:58.540] and
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.120] record

[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.580] cells
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.060] and
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:01.340] see
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:01.580] what
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:01.780] they
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.100] do.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:02.960] Well,
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:03.660] the
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.020] first
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.480] person
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:04.680] who
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:04.960] did
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.400] this
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.040] was
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:06.520] Kepfer
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.340] Hartlein.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.220] And
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:08.400] for
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:08.580] the
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:08.900] beautiful
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:09.260] work
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:09.420] he
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:09.560] had
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:09.740] done,
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:09.880] he
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.280] received
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:10.440] the
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:10.640] Nobel
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:10.980] Prize
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.200] in
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.100] 1967.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.060] Now,
[00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.990] what
[00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.210] he
[00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.550] did,
[00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:15.230] he
[00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.430] was
[00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.690] a
[00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:16.370] tremendous
[00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:17.010] surgeon.
[00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.710] And
[00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.890] so
[00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:18.130] what
[00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:18.350] he
[00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:18.610] did,
[00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.770] he
[00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:18.950] did
[00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:19.190] this
[00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.350] in
[00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:19.650] primitive
[00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:20.170] animals
[00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:20.430] like
[00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.870] frogs,
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:22.780] he
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.000] would
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.400] take
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:23.720] the
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.140] optic
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:24.720] nerve
[00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.970] and
[00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:26.130] he
[00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:26.430] would
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.780] dissect
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:28.340] one
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.460] fiber
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:29.760] from
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:29.940] the
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:30.220] optic
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:30.620] nerve,
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.160] hook
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:31.300] it
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:31.560] up,
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:32.120] and
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:32.520] record
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.080] electrically
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.420] from
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:33.640] it.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:34.380] And
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:34.640] then
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:34.860] what
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:35.040] he
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.240] would
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:35.560] do,
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:35.940] he
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:36.120] would
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:36.740] shine
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.300] a
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:37.600] light
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:37.940] into
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:38.200] the
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:38.500] eye,
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:38.800] move
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:38.940] it
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.380] around
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.500] until
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.300] the
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:41.780] cell
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.160] generated
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:44.460] detection
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.340] potentials.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.000] That
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.200] was
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:46.360] just
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:46.500] a
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:46.680] very
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.000] small
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.400] region,
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:47.780] because
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.000] as
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:48.200] I've
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:48.580] mentioned,
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.220] each
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:49.720] cell
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.280] in
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:50.420] the
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:50.700] retina,
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:50.880] each
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.280] ganglion
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:51.740] cell,
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.340] only
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:52.720] sees
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:52.980] a
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:53.340] teeny,
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:53.660] teeny
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:53.980] little
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:54.380] portion
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:54.640] of
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:54.760] the
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.060] visual
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:55.480] field.
[00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:57.110] So
[00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:57.430] that's
[00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.570] how
[00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:57.750] he
[00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.930] did
[00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:58.150] his
[00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.730] experiments.
[00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.770] And
[00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:00.170] he
[00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.330] made
[00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:00.550] some
[00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.770] really
[00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:01.310] remarkable
[00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.990] discoveries
[00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.590] which
[00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:03.090] further
[00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:03.510] then
[00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:04.110] were
[00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.370] elaborated
[00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:05.950] by
[00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:06.330] using
[00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:06.690] slightly
[00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:07.110] different
[00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:07.490] methods.
[00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:07.710] A
[00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.970] slightly
[00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:08.330] different
[00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:08.650] method,
[00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.970] first
[00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:09.110] of
[00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:09.290] all,
[00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:09.570] was
[00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:10.110] to
[00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:10.450] put
[00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:11.070] a
[00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.170] microelectrode
[00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.530] into
[00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.770] the
[00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:13.010] eye.
[00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.170] And
[00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:13.370] I've
[00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.630] mentioned
[00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:13.850] that
[00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:14.010] to
[00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:14.150] you
[00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.570] before.
[00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:15.050] The
[00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.330] initial
[00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.370] microelectrode
[00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.870] was
[00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:17.010] a
[00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:17.210] very
[00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.810] fine
[00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.070] tube
[00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:19.870] of
[00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:20.370] glass,
[00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:20.790] which
[00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:21.010] was
[00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:21.270] heated
[00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.530] and
[00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.710] then
[00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:22.130] pulled
[00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.730] until
[00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.970] the
[00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:23.170] tip
[00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:23.370] was
[00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:23.630] only
[00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.990] about
[00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.190] a
[00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.510] micron
[00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.250] in
[00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.750] diameter,
[00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:26.350] which
[00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:26.770] enabled
[00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:27.090] you
[00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:27.610] to
[00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:28.110] record
[00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:28.350] from
[00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:28.930] individual
[00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:29.990] cells
[00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.650] in
[00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:30.810] the
[00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:31.090] retina
[00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:31.450] or,
[00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:31.750] for
[00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:32.110] that
[00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:32.330] matter,
[00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.610] anywhere
[00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:32.830] in
[00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:32.950] the
[00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:33.210] brain.
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:34.420] Now,
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:34.640] another
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.080] change
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:35.200] in
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:35.300] the
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:35.580] methods
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:35.880] that
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.660] emerged
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.120] is
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:37.360] that
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.620] instead
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:38.960] of
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.900] shining
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.320] light
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.100] directly
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:41.380] into
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:41.640] the
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.080] eye,
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:43.680] the
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.360] people
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:44.660] use
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:45.180] reflected
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:45.580] light.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.480] Because
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.680] in
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.040] the
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:48.440] world,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.460] most
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:49.620] of
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:49.760] what
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:49.960] we
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.160] see
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:50.400] is
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:50.880] reflected
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.260] light.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:51.420] We
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:51.700] don't
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:51.960] get,
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:52.640] of
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:52.780] course,
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.180] nowadays
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:53.400] this
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:53.580] has
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:53.940] changed
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.100] a
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:54.240] little
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:54.460] bit,
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.000] because
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.220] we
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:55.580] have
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.620] computers
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:57.300] and
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:57.480] we
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:57.800] have
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.680] a
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:58.980] TV,
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:00.180] which
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:00.820] was
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:01.020] set
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:01.140] up
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:01.280] in
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:01.520] such
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:01.640] a
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:01.800] way
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.040] as
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:02.180] to
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:02.780] mimic
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.380] reflected
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:03.780] light,
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:04.000] if
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:04.160] you
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.420] will.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:05.860] But
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.420] in
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:06.540] the
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:06.860] natural
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:07.380] world,
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:07.740] for
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:07.860] the
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:08.100] most
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:08.380] part,
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:08.580] we
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:08.980] see
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.840] reflected
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.520] light.
[00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.320] All
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:11.560] right,
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:11.840] so
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.800] when
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.040] this
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:13.260] was
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:13.660] done,
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:14.220] this
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:14.620] initial
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:15.040] work
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.220] that
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:15.420] was
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:15.660] done
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:15.980] by
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:16.660] Kepfer
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.420]-Hartlein,
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:17.960] for
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.200] which
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:18.320] he
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:18.720] received
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:18.880] the

[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:20.060] that
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:20.260] he
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:20.960] discovered
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.000] three
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:23.340] major
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:23.820] classes
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.480] of

[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:25.860] based
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.280] on

[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.040] recording
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.260] of
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:27.440] his,
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.020] which
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:28.300] he
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:28.680] called,
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:28.960] first
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.100] of
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:29.320] all,
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:29.560] on
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.060] cells,
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:30.920] secondly,
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:31.320] off
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:31.760] cells,
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:32.300] and
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:32.480] the
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.040] thirdly,

[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:33.960]-off
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.460] cells.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:35.360] Now,
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:35.560] the
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:35.860] on
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:36.240] cells
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:36.460] were
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:36.920] those
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.320] which
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:37.460] when
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:37.600] you
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:37.860] shone
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.240] light
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:38.600] into
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:38.980] their

[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.480] area,
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:42.140] they
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:42.340] would
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:42.920] discharge
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.440] vigorously.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.080] You
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:44.400] turn
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:44.560] the
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:44.760] light
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:44.960] on
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.340] here,
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:46.080] and
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:46.640] you
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:46.800] can
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:46.980] see
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:47.180] the
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:47.400] on
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:47.720] cell
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.860] fires.
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:49.980] An
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:50.280] off
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:50.540] cell,
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:50.700] on
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:50.860] the
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:51.060] other
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:51.300] hand,
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:51.800] fired
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.280] when
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:52.420] you
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:52.680] turned
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:52.940] off
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:53.140] the
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:53.420] light
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.020] using
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:55.360] this
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:55.760] particular
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.280] method.
[00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:57.350] And
[00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:57.610] on
[00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:57.830]-off
[00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:58.190] cells
[00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.370] were
[00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.750] those
[00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:59.170] which
[00:43:59.170 --> 00:43:59.530] fired
[00:43:59.530 --> 00:43:59.850] both
[00:43:59.850 --> 00:43:59.970] to
[00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:00.110] the
[00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:00.430] onset
[00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.850] and
[00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:01.010] the
[00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.510] termination
[00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.750] of
[00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.870] the
[00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:02.150] light.
[00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.770] And
[00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:03.070] that's
[00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:03.250] why
[00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:03.430] they
[00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.610] were
[00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:03.990] called
[00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.150] and
[00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.410] are
[00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:04.690] still
[00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:05.010] called
[00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:05.150] to
[00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.370] this
[00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:05.610] day
[00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:06.030] on
[00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:06.350] and
[00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:06.650] off
[00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:07.130] cells.
[00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:08.970] So
[00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:09.150] that
[00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.310] was
[00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:09.470] an
[00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.970] incredible
[00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:10.690] discovery
[00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:11.530] and
[00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:11.830] has
[00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:12.990] created
[00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:14.190] a
[00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.630] major
[00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:15.450] evolution
[00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:16.410] in
[00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:16.930] the
[00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:17.330] study
[00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:18.050] of
[00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.710] the
[00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:19.250] visual
[00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.850] system.
[00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.950] All
[00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:21.150] right,
[00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:21.350] so
[00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:21.770] now
[00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:23.650] doing
[00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:24.270] this
[00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.670] kind
[00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.810] of
[00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:25.190] work
[00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.770] in
[00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:27.050] more
[00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.630] detail,
[00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:28.070] using
[00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:28.610] especially
[00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:29.530] mostly
[00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:30.190] reflected
[00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.690] light,
[00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:33.470] several
[00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.830] other
[00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:34.170] major
[00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:34.890] discoveries
[00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:35.170] were
[00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:35.550] made.
[00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.570] A
[00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:37.930] fellow
[00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:38.250] at
[00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:38.890] Harvard
[00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.790] in
[00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:41.170] his
[00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:41.390] later
[00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.710] years,
[00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:42.450] originally
[00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:42.690] at
[00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:42.950] Johns
[00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:43.430] Hopkins,
[00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:43.910] did
[00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:44.650] experiments
[00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:45.410] carefully
[00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.950] studying
[00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:46.150] the
[00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.590] receptive
[00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:47.070] field
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:48.980] structure
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:49.600] of
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:49.840] these
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.200] cells.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:50.620] He
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:50.800] would
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.300] record,
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:51.600] in
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:51.800] this
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.040] case,
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:52.260] with
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.140] microelectrodes
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:53.600] from
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:53.820] a
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.260] single
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:55.580] cell,
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:55.940] retinal
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:56.400] ganglion
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:56.880] cell,
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:57.440] and
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:57.600] then
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:57.840] see
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.000] how
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:58.140] it
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:58.680] responded
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:58.980] when
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:44:59.140] you
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:44:59.560] fiddled
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.000] around
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.540] with
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.160] the
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:01.540] light
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.020] in
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:02.140] the
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:02.520] receptive
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.000] field.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:03.500] So
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.020] imagine,
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:04.400] then,
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:04.880] that
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.040] the
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.260] eye
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:05.460] is
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:05.780] fixed.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.000] It's
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:06.280] looking
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:06.660] out.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.160] You're
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:07.400] putting
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:07.580] an
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:07.920] electrode
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.340] into,
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:08.940] in
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:09.140] this
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:09.360] case,
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:09.540] into
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:09.780] the
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:10.120] eye
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:10.540] or
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:10.780] wherever
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:10.960] you
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.160] put
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:11.320] it.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:11.980] And
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:12.280] then
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:12.640] you
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:12.880] can
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.220] use
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:13.700] light,
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:14.320] maybe
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:14.660] like
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:14.800] a
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:15.240] projector,
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:15.780] move
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:15.920] it
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:16.320] around
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:16.720] to
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.040] find
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.260] out
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:17.420] where
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:17.580] the
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:17.960] receptive
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.340] field
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:18.740] is.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:19.360] And
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:19.600] then
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:19.760] you
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:19.980] can
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:20.520] present,
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:21.220] say,
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:21.420] a
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:21.740] small
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:22.040] spot
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:22.220] of
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:22.520] light
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:22.660] or
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:22.760] you
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:22.940] make
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.060] it
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:23.160] a
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:23.320] big
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:23.720] spot,
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:24.400] make
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:24.500] it
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:24.780] different
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.220] colors,
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:25.440] and
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:25.620] so
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:25.760] on
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:25.880] and
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.100] so
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:26.260] on.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:26.760] So
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:26.960] when
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.220] this
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:27.460] was
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:27.900] done,
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.120] a
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.580] remarkable
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.260] discovery
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:30.600] was
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:30.860] made
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:31.140] by
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:31.540] Kufler,
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:32.580] namely
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:33.620] that
[00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.150] the
[00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.450] so
[00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:35.670]-called
[00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:36.110] on
[00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:36.290] and
[00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.650] off
[00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:37.350] cells
[00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:38.130] were
[00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:38.370] not
[00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:38.670] just
[00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:39.510] responding
[00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.870] to
[00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:40.210] the
[00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:40.510] onset
[00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.770] and
[00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:41.230] termination
[00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:41.490] of
[00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:41.810] light.
[00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:42.850] Instead,
[00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:43.770] what
[00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:43.990] they
[00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.370] did
[00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:44.770] was
[00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:45.210] they
[00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:45.750] responded
[00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.490] vigorously
[00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.690] to
[00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:46.870] a
[00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:47.170] small
[00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:47.650] spot
[00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:48.070] in
[00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:48.270] the
[00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.570] center
[00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:48.730] of
[00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:48.850] the
[00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:49.050] so
[00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:49.230]-called
[00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.670] receptive
[00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:50.130] field.
[00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:50.550] But
[00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.670] if
[00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.750] you
[00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.930] use
[00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:51.070] a
[00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:51.390] large
[00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.870] spot
[00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:52.530] like
[00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:52.930] that,
[00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.550] there
[00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:53.710] was
[00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.950] much
[00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:54.190] less
[00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.330] of
[00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:54.430] a
[00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:55.010] response.
[00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.090] And
[00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:57.330] that
[00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:57.550] was
[00:45:57.550 --> 00:45:57.790] true
[00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:58.090] also
[00:45:58.090 --> 00:45:58.330] for
[00:45:58.330 --> 00:45:58.490] the
[00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.730] off
[00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:59.090] cells
[00:45:59.090 --> 00:45:59.650] and
[00:45:59.650 --> 00:45:59.850] for
[00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:00.070] the
[00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:00.310] on
[00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:00.510]-off
[00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.870] cells.
[00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.270] So
[00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.490] the
[00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.970] surround
[00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:02.170] we
[00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:02.330] can
[00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:02.610] think
[00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:02.770] of
[00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:02.930] as
[00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:03.190] being
[00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.970] inhibitory
[00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:04.470] with
[00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.810] respect
[00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:05.050] to
[00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:05.230] the
[00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.610] center.
[00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:06.470] And
[00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.630] so
[00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.850] the
[00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:07.150] big
[00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.650] question
[00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:07.950] arose,
[00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:08.490] why
[00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:08.690] on
[00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:09.150] earth
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:11.780] did
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:12.260] this
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.300] complex
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:13.960] arrangement
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:14.700] evolve
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.220] of
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:15.540] having
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.100] cells
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:16.640] that
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:16.880] have
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.480] not
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:17.700] only
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:17.900] an
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:18.460] excitatory
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.000] center,
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:19.400] but
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:19.680] also
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:19.840] have
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:19.960] an
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.660] inhibitory
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:21.280] surround?
[00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:22.590] And
[00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:22.810] now
[00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:22.950] I'm
[00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:23.050] going
[00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:23.150] to
[00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.350] let
[00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:23.450] you
[00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.730] think
[00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:24.010] about
[00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:24.250] this
[00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:24.410] for
[00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:24.530] a
[00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.690] minute.
[00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:25.170] And
[00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:25.670] eventually,
[00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:26.390] I
[00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.670] will
[00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:27.610] tell
[00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:27.910] you
[00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:28.310] as
[00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:28.470] to
[00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.830] why
[00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:29.050] we
[00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:29.250] have
[00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:29.470] this
[00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:30.170] organization.
[00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:31.370] Because
[00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.510] we
[00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.610] are
[00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:31.770] going
[00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:31.930] to
[00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:32.270] devote
[00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.450] a
[00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.650] whole
[00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:33.130] session
[00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.930] to
[00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:34.610] the
[00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:35.010] on
[00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:35.130] and
[00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:35.370] off
[00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:35.910] systems,
[00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.490] and
[00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:36.870] also
[00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:37.610] a
[00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:37.970] complete
[00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:38.610] session
[00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:39.070] to
[00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:39.250] the
[00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:39.470] midget
[00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.630] and
[00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.030] parasol
[00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.390] cells.
[00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:40.850] And
[00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:41.130] that's
[00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:41.250] when
[00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:41.370] we
[00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:41.470] are
[00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.610] going
[00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:41.750] to
[00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:42.170] discuss
[00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.410] this
[00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.630] in
[00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:43.070] detail.
[00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.790] And
[00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:44.030] the
[00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.470] important
[00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.990] thing
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.180] as
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:46.440] you
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.900] learn
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:48.220] about
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:48.520] these
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:48.860] things
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:49.400] is
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:49.700] to
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:50.280] be
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:50.640] an
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.100] active
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:51.700] thinker.
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:52.240] And
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:52.380] if
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:52.720] something
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.020] comes
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:53.180] up
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:53.280] and
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:53.400] say,
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:53.800] well,
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.060] why
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:54.220] did
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:54.440] this
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:54.680] happen?
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:54.840] Why
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.020] did
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:55.240] that
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:55.520] happen?
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:55.740] Why
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:55.880] is
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.080] this?
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:56.260] Why
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:56.380] is
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:56.620] that?
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:57.060] When
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:57.200] you
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:57.580] actively
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:57.940] think
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:58.220] about
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:58.580] that,
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.060] then
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:46:59.220] it
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:46:59.560] becomes
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.080] interesting.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:00.980] And
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:01.600] also,
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:01.960] once
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:02.160] the
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.480] answers
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:02.860] come,
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:03.420] it
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:03.860] becomes
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.500] insightful
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.120] and
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:05.560] exciting
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.040] to
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:06.560] understand
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:06.840] it.
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:07.940] OK,
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:08.220] so
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:08.560] now
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.240] a
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:12.620] series
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:12.940] of
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:13.780] investigators
[00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:15.170] did
[00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.730] experiments
[00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:15.970] in
[00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:16.190] which
[00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.470] they,
[00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.830] this
[00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:17.190] sounds
[00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.550] like
[00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:17.650] a
[00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:17.850] fairly
[00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:18.250] simple
[00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:18.730] experiment,
[00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:19.270] in
[00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.430] which
[00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.650] they
[00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:19.970] did
[00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.590] labeling
[00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:21.930] of
[00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:22.170] just
[00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:22.350] the
[00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:22.730] cell
[00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:23.390] bodies
[00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:24.030] in
[00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.190] the
[00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.530] retina,
[00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.210] and
[00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:25.390] did
[00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.570] what
[00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:25.730] is
[00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.950] called
[00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:26.110] a
[00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:26.390] hole
[00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.750] mount.
[00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:27.070] What's
[00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:27.170] a
[00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.350] hole
[00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:27.650] mount?
[00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:28.090] You
[00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:28.330] take
[00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:28.530] the
[00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:28.850] retina,
[00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:29.250] you
[00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:29.510] flatten
[00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.710] it
[00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.970] out,
[00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.290] and
[00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.430] then
[00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:30.570] you
[00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:30.730] look
[00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:30.910] at
[00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:32.290] this
[00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:32.590] whole
[00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:33.050] layout
[00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:33.710] through
[00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.870] a
[00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:34.270] microscope.
[00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:35.110] And
[00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:35.290] if
[00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:35.430] you
[00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.850] label
[00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:36.150] then
[00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.410] these
[00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.730] cells,
[00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:36.890] and
[00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:37.310] this
[00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:37.830] was
[00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:38.290] a
[00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:38.450] so
[00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.650]-called
[00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:39.050] nissl
[00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.430] stain
[00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.670] that
[00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.970] stains
[00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:40.150] the
[00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.370] cell
[00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.770] bodies,
[00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:41.270] but
[00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.750] doesn't
[00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:42.210] stain
[00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:44.550] the
[00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:45.530] processes
[00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:45.910] like
[00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:46.070] the
[00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:46.450] dendrites
[00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:46.610] or
[00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:46.750] the
[00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:47.230] exons.
[00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:48.030] What
[00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.230] they
[00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.690] found
[00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:49.070] was
[00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:49.410] that
[00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:49.550] if
[00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:49.750] you
[00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.950] did
[00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:50.190] this
[00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:51.130] quantitatively,
[00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:51.590] they
[00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:51.810] could
[00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:52.390] distinguish
[00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:53.630] three
[00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:54.570] very
[00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:55.270] distinct
[00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.950] different
[00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:56.470] classes
[00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.690] of
[00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:57.250] cells.
[00:47:57.930 --> 00:47:58.230] Turned
[00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.370] out
[00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.630] later
[00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.850] that
[00:47:58.850 --> 00:47:58.990] there
[00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.110] were
[00:47:59.110 --> 00:47:59.310] more
[00:47:59.310 --> 00:47:59.490] than
[00:47:59.490 --> 00:47:59.730] three.
[00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:00.250] But
[00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:00.650] in
[00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.890] this
[00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:01.110] case,
[00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.350] just
[00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:01.630] doing
[00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.790] it
[00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:02.150] crudely
[00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.390] like
[00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.630] that,
[00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.910] you
[00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:03.050] can
[00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.230] see
[00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.450] those
[00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:03.710] big
[00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:04.130] cells,
[00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:04.410] that
[00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:04.670] one,
[00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.950] that
[00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:05.190] one,
[00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:05.450] that
[00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.670] one,
[00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.910] that
[00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:06.090] one,
[00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.290] that
[00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:06.450] one,
[00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:06.550] and
[00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:06.750] so
[00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.970] on,
[00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:08.010] maybe
[00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:08.350] one
[00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:08.570] out
[00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:08.710] of
[00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.990] seven
[00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.130] or
[00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:09.290] eight
[00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.450] in
[00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:09.650] this
[00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:10.110] sample,
[00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:10.770] are
[00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:10.970] these
[00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:11.310] huge
[00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:11.670] cells.
[00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:12.190] And
[00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.410] then
[00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.610] you
[00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:13.030] have
[00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.530] some
[00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:13.990] smaller
[00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.470] cells,
[00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:15.110] and
[00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:15.370] then
[00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:15.610] you
[00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:15.870] also
[00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:16.050] have
[00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:16.230] some
[00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.590] tiny
[00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:17.010] cells.
[00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.690] And
[00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.830] if
[00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:17.950] you
[00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:18.090] did
[00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:18.330] this
[00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:19.270] quantitatively,
[00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.810] they
[00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:20.350] argued
[00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:20.830] that
[00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:20.950] they
[00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:21.470] formed
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.200] distinct
[00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.910] separate
[00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:25.650] populations.
[00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:25.930] They
[00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:26.030] were
[00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.210] not
[00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.350] a
[00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:26.930] continuum.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:28.650] So
[00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:29.030] then
[00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.430] that,
[00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:29.630] of
[00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.790] course,
[00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.950] is
[00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:30.070] a
[00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:30.370] basic
[00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:30.990] requirement
[00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.270] to
[00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.810] prove
[00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:32.450] that
[00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.950] indeed
[00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:33.730] these
[00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:33.870] are
[00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:34.150] different
[00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.730] classes
[00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:35.010] of
[00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:35.310] cells
[00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:35.710] that
[00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:36.130] probably
[00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:36.710] perform
[00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:37.210] different
[00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:37.730] jobs.
[00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:38.750] So
[00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.970] what
[00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:39.190] can
[00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.350] you
[00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:39.570] do
[00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:39.930] to
[00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:40.830] prove
[00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:41.130] this
[00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:41.590] further?
[00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:42.750] Well,
[00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.950] subsequent
[00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:44.330] to
[00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:44.550] this
[00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:44.790] kind
[00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.930] of
[00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:45.250] work,
[00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:46.610] people
[00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:46.950] began
[00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:47.190] to
[00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.410] look
[00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:48.070] at
[00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:49.090] another
[00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:49.770] interesting
[00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:50.910] question
[00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:51.370] about
[00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:52.710] how
[00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:53.290] these
[00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:53.610] retinal
[00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:53.990] ganglion
[00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.330] cells
[00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:54.630] send
[00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.810] their
[00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:55.170] signals
[00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:55.350] to
[00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:55.510] the
[00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.790] central
[00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:56.130] nervous
[00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:56.530] system.
[00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:57.910] And
[00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:58.090] it's
[00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:58.230] been
[00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.670] discovered
[00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.950] not
[00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:59.210] just
[00:48:59.210 --> 00:48:59.370] in
[00:48:59.370 --> 00:48:59.530] the
[00:48:59.530 --> 00:48:59.810] retina,
[00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:00.130] but
[00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:00.510] in
[00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:00.750] many
[00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.970] other
[00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:01.250] parts
[00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.610] of
[00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.310] the
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.960] human

[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:05.820] animal
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.320] body
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:07.320] that
[00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:08.830] the
[00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:09.630] rapidity
[00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:10.310] with
[00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:11.470] which
[00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:12.650] an
[00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:13.810] axon
[00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:14.170] can
[00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:15.230] send
[00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.750] its
[00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:16.090] action
[00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:17.270] potentials
[00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.650] down
[00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:17.970] from
[00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:18.250] one
[00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:18.890] location
[00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:19.110] to
[00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:19.290] the
[00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:19.650] next,
[00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:19.990] from
[00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.110] the
[00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:20.290] cell
[00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:20.590] body,
[00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.830] say,
[00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:21.070] to
[00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:22.270] the
[00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:23.030] axon
[00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.530] terminals,
[00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:27.050] very
[00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.750] much
[00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:28.350] depends
[00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:29.050] on
[00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:29.310] the
[00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:29.650] size
[00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:29.790] of
[00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:29.970] the
[00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:30.350] cell
[00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:30.750] and
[00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.970] the
[00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:31.290] size
[00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:31.450] of
[00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:31.630] the
[00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:32.150] axon.
[00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:33.210] So
[00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:33.430] if
[00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.570] you
[00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:33.810] have
[00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:34.150] a
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.200] small
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:35.700] cell
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:35.900] and
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.000] a
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.200] very
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:36.740] thin
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.400] axon,
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:38.320] the
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:38.780] conduction
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:39.500] is
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:39.960] slower
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.560] than
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:40.780] if
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:40.900] you
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:41.080] have
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:41.260] a
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:41.740] big
[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:42.100] cell
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:42.400] and
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:42.540] a
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:42.740] big
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:43.220] axon.
[00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.610] So
[00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:45.050] if
[00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.390] that's
[00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.570] the
[00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:45.990] case,
[00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:46.710] people
[00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:47.230] argued
[00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.810] that
[00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:48.030] if
[00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.170] you
[00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.330] were
[00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:48.510] to
[00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.910] take
[00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:49.970] the
[00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.010] optic
[00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:51.610] nerve
[00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:52.750] and
[00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:53.390] stimulate
[00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.890] it
[00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:54.350] at
[00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:54.650] one
[00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:55.330] site
[00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:55.830] and
[00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:56.010] a
[00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:56.030] little
[00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.250] ways
[00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:56.770] down,
[00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:57.350] maybe
[00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:57.690] back
[00:49:57.690 --> 00:49:57.990] towards
[00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.150] the
[00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.470] retina,
[00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.890] record
[00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:01.730] and
[00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:02.050] see
[00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:02.270] what
[00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.570] kind
[00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:02.790] of
[00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:03.230] overall
[00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.810] general,
[00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.710] not
[00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:05.030] action
[00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.650] potentials,
[00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:05.810] but
[00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:06.210] overall
[00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:06.830] activation
[00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:07.570] takes
[00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:08.030] place.
[00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:08.550] And
[00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:08.690] when
[00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.950] that
[00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:09.170] was
[00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.630] done,
[00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:10.970] an
[00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:11.570] amazing
[00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:12.110] discovery
[00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:12.410] was
[00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.710] made.
[00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:13.310] In
[00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:13.610] this
[00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:14.110] case,
[00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.730] you
[00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:14.930] can
[00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:15.250] see
[00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:15.490] we
[00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:15.910] have
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:16.900] two
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:17.400] major
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:17.720] dips
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:18.100] here.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.140] This
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:19.320] is
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:19.800] time.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.580] Here
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.000] is
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:21.440] electrical
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.080] stimulation.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.040] Here's
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:23.180] the
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:23.660] activation
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.100] of
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:24.920] hundreds
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.160] and
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:25.360] hundreds
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:25.620] of
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:25.980] fibers.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:26.580] And
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:26.740] it
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:27.060] shows
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:27.280] that
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:27.440] they
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:27.720] form
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.180] distinct
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:28.640] groups,
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:29.240] a
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:29.460] very
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:29.840] rapidly
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:30.420] conducting
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:30.780] group,
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:31.120] a
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:31.300] slow
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:31.840] conducting
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.380] group,
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:33.120] and
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:33.380] a
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:33.620] very
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:33.940] slow,
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:34.440] more
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:34.900] diffused
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:35.200] group.
[00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.670] So
[00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:37.110] then
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.280] it
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:39.460] was
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:39.900] subsequently
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.600] established
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:43.440] that
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:43.860] these
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:44.160] very
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:44.640] rapidly
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.440] conducting
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.760] axons
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.180] come
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:49.720] from
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.600] the

[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:51.680] parasol
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.180] cells.
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:52.880] The
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.300] medium
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:53.880] conducting
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:54.240] ones
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:54.480] come
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:54.680] from
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:54.860] the
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:55.100] midget
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:55.560] cells.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:56.500] All
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:56.720] right?
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:57.840] I'll
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:58.240] tell
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:58.380] you
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:58.880] exactly
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.120] how
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:50:59.460] that
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:50:59.680] was
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.220] established.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:00.800] But
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.080] now
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:01.320] that
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:01.540] has
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:01.860] become
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:02.080] a
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:02.400] solid
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:02.940] fact.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:03.820] OK,
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:04.300] so
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:04.700] now
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.020] if
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:05.100] you
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:05.260] go
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:05.560] back
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:05.720] to
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:05.880] the
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:06.260] anatomy
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:06.600] of
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:06.800] these
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.100] cell
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:07.440] types,
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:07.920] if
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:08.040] you
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:08.240] look
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:08.400] at
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:08.560] them
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:08.720] at
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:09.220] equivalent
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.880] distances
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:14.620] of
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:15.240] eccentricity,
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.440] 1,
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.120] 3,
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:17.400] and
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:17.720] 5
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.260].7
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:18.720] degrees,
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.360] here
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.160] are
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.380] examples
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:21.980] of
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:22.440] the
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:22.720] midget
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.160] cell
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:23.860] dendritic
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:24.120] arbors.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:24.440] Again,
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:24.640] this
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:24.780] is
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:24.780] a
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:24.940] whole
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:25.140] bunch.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:25.340] You're
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:25.720] looking
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.140] straight
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:26.640] down
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.540] at
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:27.720] the
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.060] cell.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:28.420] All
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:28.620] right?
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.080] You
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:29.260] can
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:29.500] see
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:29.720] these
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:30.220] are
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:30.900] very
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.840] constricted
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.540] dendritic
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:33.980] arbors.
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:34.420] Now
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:34.580] by
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:35.280] contrast,
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:35.500] the
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:35.960] parasol
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:36.420] cells
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:37.240] have
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.020] much,
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:38.300] much
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:38.700] larger,
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:38.960] three
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:39.340] times
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:39.740] larger
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:39.960] in
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.440] diameter,
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.100] dendritic
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:42.580] arbors.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:43.580] And
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:43.860] now
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:44.060] I
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:44.220] can
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:44.580] tell
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:44.800] you,
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.040] which
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:45.180] I
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:45.660] deferred
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.060] before,
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:46.580] is
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:46.740] that
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:46.860] if
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:46.980] you
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:47.160] look
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:47.360] at
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:47.740] these,
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:48.440] the
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:48.700] reason
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:48.920] they're
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.120] called
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:49.600] parasol
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:49.940] cells
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.140] is
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:50.420] what?
[00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:52.010] Because
[00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.330] it
[00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:52.530] looks
[00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:52.770] like
[00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:53.910] an
[00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:54.950] umbrella.
[00:51:55.930 --> 00:51:56.250] OK?
[00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:57.290] So
[00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:57.670] this
[00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.870] looks
[00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:58.090] like
[00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:58.230] an
[00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.610] umbrella.
[00:51:59.130 --> 00:51:59.530] And
[00:51:59.530 --> 00:51:59.710] of
[00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.870] course,
[00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:00.130] that's
[00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:00.650] parasol.
[00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:01.830] So
[00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:02.330] that's
[00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:02.530] why
[00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:02.770] they
[00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:02.950] are
[00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:03.150] called
[00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:03.630] parasol
[00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:04.010] cells.
[00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:04.430] And
[00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.650] these
[00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:04.990] guys,
[00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:05.750] most
[00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.830] of
[00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:05.930] us
[00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:06.370] interesting,
[00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.610] are
[00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:06.910] called
[00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:07.210] midget
[00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:07.490] cells
[00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.810] because
[00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:07.990] they're
[00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.310] midget.
[00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.650] They're
[00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:08.910] small.
[00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:10.050] All
[00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:10.230] right,
[00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:10.410] so
[00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:10.650] that
[00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:11.050] then
[00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:11.850] established,
[00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:13.470] this
[00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.690] work
[00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:13.870] was
[00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:14.050] done
[00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:14.230] just
[00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.490] 20
[00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:14.750] years
[00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.990] ago.
[00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:16.010] It
[00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.210] was
[00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:16.790] established
[00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:17.590] that
[00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:17.770] you
[00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:17.990] have
[00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.350] indeed
[00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:18.690] these
[00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:18.990] two
[00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.410] very,
[00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.630] very
[00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:20.210] distinct
[00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.850] populations
[00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:21.190] of
[00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.510] cells.
[00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:22.430] So
[00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.690] now
[00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:22.890] the
[00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:23.110] big
[00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:23.530] question
[00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:23.910] came
[00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:24.170] up,
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:25.520] why
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:25.720] do
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:25.900] we
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:26.080] have
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:26.300] on
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:26.420] and
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:26.640] off
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.000] cells?
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:27.620] Why
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:27.840] do
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.000] we
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:28.180] have
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:28.420] midget
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:28.560] and
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:28.940] parasol
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:29.320] cells?
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:29.920] And
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:30.040] as
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:30.160] I
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:30.300] say,
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:30.500] we
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:30.720] are
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:30.880] going
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.020] to
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:31.380] discuss
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:31.580] this
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:31.740] in
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:32.160] considerable
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:32.720] detail.
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:33.380] But
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:33.620] let
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:33.760] me
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.000] just
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.240] give
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:34.400] you
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:34.740] a
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.060] crude
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:35.640] introduction.
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:36.480] If
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:36.560] you
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:36.760] look
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:36.880] at
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:37.020] a
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:37.460] parasol
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:37.880] cell,
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:38.940] obviously
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:39.340] because
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:39.500] of
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:39.660] the
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.200] huge
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:40.660] dendritic
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:40.960] arbor,
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:41.580] they
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:41.860] have
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:42.360] large,
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:43.440] relatively
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.000] speaking,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:44.880] much
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:45.480] larger
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.060] receptor
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:46.280] fields,
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:46.520] three
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:46.760] times
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.060] bigger
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:47.800] than
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.440] midget
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:48.860] cells.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:49.380] The
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:49.620] midget
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.100] cells
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:50.980] are
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:51.260] so
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:51.900] specific
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:52.700] that
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:53.060] each
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:53.580] cell
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:54.560] in
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:54.940] central
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:55.460] retina
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.060] gets
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:56.460] input
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:56.700] for
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:56.880] the
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.560] excitatory
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.000] center
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:58.240] from
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:58.440] just
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:58.900] one
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:52:59.520] single
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:52:59.920] cone.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.000] Now
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:01.140] what
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:01.300] does
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:01.540] that
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:01.840] mean?
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:03.520] What
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:03.780] I
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.400] didn't
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:04.800] emphasize
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.320] before,
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:05.520] but
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:05.680] I'm
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.000] sure
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:06.160] you
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:06.460] all
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:06.820] know,
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.400] that
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:07.580] we
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:07.780] have
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.100] three
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:08.420] major
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:08.900] classes
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:09.200] of
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:09.600] cones,
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:10.480] which
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:10.680] some
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:10.940] people
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:11.380] call
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.940] red,
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:13.180] green,
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:13.380] and
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:13.600] blue.
[00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:14.600] And
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:14.820] then
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.120] when
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:15.280] you
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:15.520] say
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:15.900] that,
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:16.540] the
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:16.760] real
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.180] officiators
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:17.660] say,
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:17.900] come
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.040] on,
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:18.140] you
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:18.420] can't
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:18.580] say
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:18.920] that.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.040] You're
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:20.320] supposed
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:20.540] to
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:20.820] say
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:21.360] short,
[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:21.680] medium,
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:21.900] and
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:22.120] long
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:22.540] wavelength
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:24.040] sensitive
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:24.540] neurons.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:24.940] But
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:25.100] we'll
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:25.240] just
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:25.440] call
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:25.540] them
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:25.740] red,
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:25.940] green,
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:26.100] and
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:26.260] blue.
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:27.080] Now
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:27.260] the
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:27.620] reason
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:27.880] then
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:28.200] is
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:28.680] that
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:28.960] the
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.480] center
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.180] of
[00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:31.910] one
[00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:32.270] class
[00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.450] of
[00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:32.690] midget
[00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:33.150] cells
[00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.510] gets
[00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.790] input
[00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:34.050] only
[00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:34.250] from
[00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:34.510] red
[00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.750] cones,
[00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:35.130] another
[00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:35.410] from
[00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:35.750] green
[00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:36.050] cones,
[00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.430] and
[00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.650] some
[00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.850] from
[00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:37.110] blue
[00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:37.370] cones.
[00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.910] I'll
[00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:38.090] show
[00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:38.250] that
[00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:38.370] in
[00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:38.550] more
[00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:38.830] detail
[00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:39.030] in
[00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.150] a
[00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.290] minute.
[00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:40.170] So
[00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:40.690] we
[00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:40.930] have
[00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:41.230] these
[00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:41.530] three
[00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:42.650] subtypes.
[00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:43.110] And
[00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:43.310] so
[00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:44.030] therefore,
[00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:44.670] we
[00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.890] can
[00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:45.330] say
[00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:45.710] that
[00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.870] the
[00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:46.110] midget
[00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:46.470] cells,
[00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.790] because
[00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.970] they're
[00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:47.190] so
[00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.570] teeny,
[00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:48.130] they
[00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:48.350] should
[00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:48.530] be
[00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.710] able
[00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.910] to
[00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:49.130] see
[00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.470] fine
[00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.990] detail.
[00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:50.830] And
[00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:51.190] because
[00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.430] of
[00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.730] this
[00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:52.790] wiring,
[00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:53.350] they
[00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:53.530] should
[00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:53.670] be
[00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.850] able
[00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:54.030] to
[00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.230] tell
[00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.370] you
[00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:54.590] about
[00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:54.990] color.
[00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:55.930] By
[00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:56.430] contrast,
[00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:56.750] if
[00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.850] you
[00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:57.050] look
[00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:57.170] at
[00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.330] the
[00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:57.770] parasol
[00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:58.250] cells,
[00:53:58.650 --> 00:53:58.850] they
[00:53:58.850 --> 00:53:59.030] get
[00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.190] a
[00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.450] mix
[00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.650] of
[00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:00.150] inputs,
[00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:00.450] both
[00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:00.590] in
[00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:00.770] the
[00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:01.170] center
[00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:01.830] and
[00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:02.050] their
[00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:02.570] surround.
[00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:03.250] So
[00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:03.490] it's
[00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:03.850] unlikely
[00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:04.130] that
[00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.290] they
[00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:04.450] can
[00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:04.710] tell
[00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.830] you
[00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:05.090] about
[00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:05.470] color.
[00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:06.210] And
[00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:06.450] we'll
[00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:06.850] examine
[00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:07.210] that
[00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:07.410] in
[00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:07.610] much
[00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:07.810] more
[00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:08.110] detail
[00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:08.470] soon.
[00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.170] All
[00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.350] right,
[00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.530] so
[00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.830] now
[00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.230] the
[00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.410] other
[00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:10.810] interesting
[00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:11.130] thing
[00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:11.470] about
[00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:12.210] this
[00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:12.610] system
[00:54:12.610 --> 00:54:12.770] is
[00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.890] it
[00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:13.150] makes
[00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.370] you
[00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:13.870] speculate
[00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:14.210] as
[00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.330] to
[00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:14.490] why
[00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:14.670] we
[00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.910] have
[00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:15.150] them.
[00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:15.670] And
[00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.890] we'll
[00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:16.230] elaborate
[00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.570] on
[00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:16.890] that.
[00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.450] It
[00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.570] is
[00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:17.850] that
[00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:17.990] the
[00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.230] midget
[00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.630] system,
[00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:18.830] when
[00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:18.950] you
[00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:19.190] turn
[00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.350] on
[00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:19.490] the
[00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:19.710] light,
[00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:19.910] when
[00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:20.070] you
[00:54:20.070 --> 00:54:20.690] shine
[00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.870] a
[00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:21.130] small
[00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:21.410] spot
[00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:21.510] in
[00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.630] the
[00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:21.810] center
[00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:22.450] receptive
[00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:22.810] field,
[00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:23.490] gives
[00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:23.610] you
[00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:23.710] a
[00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.930] fairly
[00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:24.530] sustained
[00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:25.210] response
[00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:25.670] for
[00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.830] the
[00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:26.050] brief
[00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:26.350] time
[00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:26.550] that
[00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:26.750] was
[00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.950] on,
[00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.170] maybe
[00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.450] a
[00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:28.070] second
[00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:28.290] or
[00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:28.490] two.
[00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:29.530] But
[00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:29.730] the
[00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:30.190] parasol
[00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.690] system
[00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:31.170] gives
[00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:31.290] you
[00:54:31.290 --> 00:54:31.490] only
[00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:31.730] a
[00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:32.150] burst,
[00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:32.930] like
[00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:33.330] that,
[00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:34.170] instead
[00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:34.410] of
[00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:34.950] a
[00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:35.390] sustained
[00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.970] response.
[00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:37.070] So
[00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:37.350] think
[00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:37.650] about
[00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:38.050] that.
[00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:38.410] Say,
[00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:38.690] why
[00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:38.950] would
[00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:39.150] we
[00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.390] have
[00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.610] two
[00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:40.090] systems
[00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:40.470] which
[00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.570] are
[00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:40.730] not
[00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.930] only
[00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:41.270] different
[00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.530] in
[00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:42.030] size,
[00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:42.450] but
[00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:42.710] also
[00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:43.050] different
[00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:43.270] in
[00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.570] the
[00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:43.890] profile
[00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:44.170] of
[00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:44.330] their
[00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:44.810] responses?
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:46.420] And
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:46.740] then,
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:47.120] once
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:47.260] you
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:47.400] have
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:47.580] this
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:47.940] question
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:48.100] in
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:48.220] your
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:48.500] mind,
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:49.040] then
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:49.280] you'll
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:49.400] be
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:49.600] eager
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:49.800] to
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.100] find
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:50.480] out
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:50.900] when
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:51.020] we
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:51.240] talk
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:51.560] about
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:51.800] that
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:52.100] time
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:52.360] after
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:52.740] next.
[00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.930] OK,
[00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.490] so
[00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:54.730] now
[00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:55.010] let's
[00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:55.150] go
[00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.430] back
[00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.610] to
[00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:55.770] the
[00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:56.090] beginning
[00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:56.450] here
[00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.590] and
[00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:56.830] talk
[00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:57.070] about
[00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:57.250] the
[00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:58.030] photoreceptors
[00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.190] in
[00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.390] just
[00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.550] a
[00:54:58.550 --> 00:54:58.690] bit
[00:54:58.690 --> 00:54:58.950] more
[00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:59.510] detail.
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:02.420] Just
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:02.560] so
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:02.660] we
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:02.780] can
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:02.940] get
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:03.120] a
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:03.340] better
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:03.960] picture
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.160] of
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:04.300] it.
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.020] Here,
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:05.200] as
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:05.400] I've
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:05.640] mentioned
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:05.820] to
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:05.920] you
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.220] before,
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:06.360] in
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:06.540] the
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.160] fovea,
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:07.700] you
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:07.860] have
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:08.140] very,
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:08.360] very
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:08.860] tightly
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:09.400] packed
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.200] cone
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.760] photoreceptors.
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:13.460] They're
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:13.760] almost
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.580] hexagonal
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:14.720] in
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:14.980] shape,
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:15.220] rather
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:15.500] than
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:15.900] round.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:16.180] They're
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:16.340] so
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:16.740] tightly
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:17.180] packed.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:18.260] But
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:18.460] then,
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:18.600] when
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:18.700] you
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:18.860] go
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:19.180] five
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:19.540] degrees
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:20.100] out,
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:20.540] you
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:20.820] first
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:20.940] of
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:21.080] all
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:21.260] see
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:21.500] that
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:21.820] the
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:22.960] cone's
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.120] got
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:23.280] to
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:23.440] be
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:23.660] much
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:24.160] larger.
[00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:25.410] And
[00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:25.710] now
[00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.870] you
[00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:26.050] have
[00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:26.210] an
[00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.890] intermixture
[00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:27.350] of
[00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:28.330] rods
[00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:28.770] there
[00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:29.070] that
[00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:29.210] you
[00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:29.390] can
[00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.710] see.
[00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:31.970] So
[00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:32.230] in
[00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.490] this
[00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:32.930] region,
[00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.690] you
[00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:34.010] can
[00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.870] process
[00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:35.270] both
[00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.830] information
[00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:36.070] at
[00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:36.350] low
[00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:37.030] illumination
[00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.430] levels
[00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.610] and
[00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:37.850] high
[00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:38.310] illumination
[00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:38.670] levels.
[00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:39.150] Whereas
[00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:39.610] here,
[00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.790] as
[00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:43.650] Kepfer
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.480]-Hartlein
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:44.660] had
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.000] proven,
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:46.300] you
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:47.040] can
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:47.420] only
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:48.080] see
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:48.420] under
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.600] fairly
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.700] bright,
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:51.220] normal
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.080] illumination
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.760] conditions.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.280] OK,
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:57.540] so
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:57.900] now,
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:58.640] if
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:58.760] you
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:58.900] go
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.160] even
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:55:59.680] further
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.180] out
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:00.660] in
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:00.800] the
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.040] retina,
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.260] this
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:01.380] is
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:01.500] a
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:01.840] beautiful
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:02.240] three
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:02.620]-dimensional
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:02.960] looking
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:03.360] picture.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:03.900] This
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:04.160] shows
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:04.340] the
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:04.560] rods
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:04.740] and
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:04.920] the
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.260] cones
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:05.920] in
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.080] the
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:06.660] periphery.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.180] And
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:07.460] many,
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:07.700] many
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:07.960] more
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.300] rods
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:08.540] per
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:08.780] unit
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:09.200] area.
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:10.060] And
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:10.280] the
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:10.700] cones
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.400] have
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:11.740] gotten
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:12.020] even
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:12.460] bigger.
[00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.590] And
[00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:13.810] so
[00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:14.330] obviously,
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:15.980] the
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.380] ability
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:17.080] for
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:17.260] the
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:17.520] cones
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:17.720] to
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.180] process
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:18.640] fine
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.300] information
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.320] has
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.160] been
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:22.800] degraded
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.000] as
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:23.140] a
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:23.520] result.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.180] Now
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:24.500] again,
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:24.740] as
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:24.920] I've
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:25.180] mentioned
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:25.400] to
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:25.560] you
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:26.060] before,
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:26.680] we
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.060] have
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:27.520] in
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.060] humans,
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:28.620] there
[00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:28.680] are
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:28.880] about
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.360] 120
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:30.920] million
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:31.340] rods,
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:31.760] now
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:32.100] 5
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:32.380] million
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:32.780] cones,
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:33.280] in
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:33.720] each
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.360] retina.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:35.720] OK,
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:36.020] so
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:36.380] now,
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:36.920] if
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.040] you
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:37.240] look
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:37.400] at
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:37.540] the
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:37.840] overall
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:38.480] distribution,
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:38.760] this
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:38.880] is
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:39.060] not
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:39.200] too
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:39.600] important,
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.180] you
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:40.380] can
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:40.700] see
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:41.080] that
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:41.700] as
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:41.880] you
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:42.780] go
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:43.240] away
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:43.440] from
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:43.620] the
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:44.000] fovea,
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:44.280] there's
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:44.420] a
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:44.680] very
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:45.160] rapid
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:45.820] decline
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:46.600] in
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:46.800] the
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.160] number
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:47.780] of
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:48.180] cones.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:48.440] That's
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:48.580] a
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.780] hash
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:50.160] line.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:51.760] And
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.280] there
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:52.720] are
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.040] no
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.000] rods
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:54.120] in
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:54.280] the
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:54.680] fovea.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.040] But
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:55.160] they
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:55.540] increase
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:55.960] rapidly.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:56.200] And
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:56.400] then
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:56.600] they
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:56.860] fall
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:57.180] off.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:57.700] So
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:58.040] that's
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:58.320] sort
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:58.420] of
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:58.560] the
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:58.860] overall
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:56:59.520] distribution.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:00.480] And
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:00.860] therefore,
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:01.260] you
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:01.400] can
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:01.600] see
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:01.960] fine
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.380] detail
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:02.540] in
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:02.700] the
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:03.000] center.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:03.500] And
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:03.660] you're
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:03.900] very
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:04.640] sensitive
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.260] for
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:07.560] night
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:08.000] vision.
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:08.720] And
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:08.900] not
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:09.000] in
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.120] the
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:09.560] far
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.100] periphery,
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:10.360] but
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:10.620] sort
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:10.740] of
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:11.100] in
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:11.220] the
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:11.720] mid
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.020]-section
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:15.280] here,
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:15.940] anywhere
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:16.360] between
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:16.840] 20
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.140] and
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:17.840] 40
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.460] degrees
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.620] from
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:20.560] the
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:21.360] fovea.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:21.900] Now
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:22.060] let
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:22.280] me
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.720] remind
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.060] you,
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:24.380] because
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:24.580] I'm
[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:24.760] sure
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:24.900] you
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.080] know
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:25.240] all
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:25.420] this
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:25.780] already,
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:26.380] a
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:26.600] few
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.160] facts.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.100] I
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:33.280] will
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:33.500] just
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:33.720] write
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:33.900] down
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:34.040] a
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:34.240] couple
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:34.420] of
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:34.600] these
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:34.800] things.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:35.060] First
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:35.260] of
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:35.860] all,
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.460] what
[00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:38.310] is
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.020] a
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:40.440] degree
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:40.700] of
[00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:41.000] visual
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:41.420] angle?
[00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.770] That's
[00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:42.870] a
[00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:43.030] good
[00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:43.590] question.
[00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:44.790] What
[00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:44.970] does
[00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:45.130] it
[00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:45.350] mean
[00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:45.510] on
[00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.910] the
[00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:46.190] retinal
[00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.590] surface?
[00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:47.230] Just
[00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.470] let
[00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.690] me
[00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:48.230] give
[00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.370] you
[00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:48.570] an
[00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:49.410] interesting
[00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:50.130] mnemonic.
[00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:50.750] If
[00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.910] you
[00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:51.190] stick
[00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.430] out
[00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.670] your
[00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:52.330] arm
[00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:53.290] like
[00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:53.610] that,
[00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:53.710] and
[00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.810] you
[00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:53.970] look
[00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:54.110] at
[00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:54.290] your
[00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:54.750] thumbnail,
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.120] that
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:56.720] imprints
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:57.320] one
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:57.620] degree
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:57.820] of
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:58.140] visual
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:57:58.600] angle
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:57:59.700] on
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:57:59.820] the
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:00.080] retinal
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:00.600] surface.
[00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.380] OK?
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:03.860] Now
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:04.000] we
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:04.120] are
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:04.300] going
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:04.460] to
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:04.760] talk
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:04.940] a
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:05.100] lot
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:05.580] about
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:06.340] very
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:06.980] small
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:08.000] measurements.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:08.960] And
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:09.180] so
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:09.300] when
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:09.420] we
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:09.680] talk
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.120] about
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:10.960] small
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.400] measurement,
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:11.680] I
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.000] mentioned
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:12.400] already
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.020] that
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:13.200] the
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:13.380] tip
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:13.540] of
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:13.720] a
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.320] microelectron
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:14.540] is
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:14.800] about
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:15.120] one
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:15.720] micron.
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:15.980] And
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:16.100] what
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:16.220] is
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:16.380] a
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:16.740] micron?
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:18.520] Anybody
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.060] know?
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:19.980] Yes?
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:22.980] 10
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:23.140] to
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:23.280] the
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:23.560] negative
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:24.120] 6.
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:24.860] OK.
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:25.900] One
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:26.640] micron
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.120] is
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:28.720] 1
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.460],000th
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:29.560] of
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:29.940] a
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:30.640] millimeter.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:31.580] OK?
[00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:34.950] Now,
[00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:35.750] talking
[00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:36.150] about
[00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.370] that
[00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:36.530] in
[00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.770] terms
[00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.950] of
[00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:37.490] millimeters,
[00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.850] which
[00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:37.930] we
[00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:38.010] are
[00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:38.170] going
[00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:38.290] to
[00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:38.450] do
[00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.590] a
[00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:38.830] lot,
[00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:39.190] that's
[00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.670] the
[00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:40.030] greatest
[00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:40.590] convention.
[00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:41.190] We
[00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.410] need
[00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:41.590] to
[00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:41.990] also
[00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.510] know
[00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:43.230] what
[00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.370] is
[00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:43.510] the
[00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:44.110] relationship
[00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:45.650] between
[00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:46.290] inches
[00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:47.030] and
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.700] millimeters,
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:49.400] centimeters.
[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:50.440] OK,
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:50.640] so
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:50.760] if
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:50.860] you
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:51.080] take
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:51.400] one
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:51.820] inch,
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:57.000] we
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.220] all
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:57.380] know
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:57.560] what
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:57.740] an
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:58.040] inch
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:58.320] is,
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:58.520] I
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:58.800] guess.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.120] Roughly,
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:00.280] if
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:00.360] you
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:00.520] look
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:00.640] at
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:00.800] your
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:01.100] thumbnail
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:01.480] again,
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:01.700] it's
[00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:01.900] maybe
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:02.080] a
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:02.220] little
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:02.540] bit
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.080] under
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:03.280] an
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:03.540] inch.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:04.000] OK?
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.460] Now,
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:05.800] one
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:06.320] inch
[00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:08.870] equals
[00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:10.290] 2
[00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:12.730].54
[00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:14.690] millimeters.
[00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:15.450] OK?
[00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.890] So
[00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:17.190] that's
[00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.330] a
[00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:18.090] very
[00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:18.510] interesting
[00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.950] mnemonic
[00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:19.170] to
[00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:19.610] remember.
[00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.570] So
[00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:21.370] whenever
[00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:22.190] you
[00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.430] look
[00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.550] at
[00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:22.870] various
[00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:23.350] things
[00:59:23.350 --> 00:59:23.690] and
[00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.910] try
[00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:24.130] to
[00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:24.710] understand
[00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:25.450] size,
[00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:26.630] you
[00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:27.090] may
[00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:27.350] need
[00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:27.510] to
[00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.690] make
[00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:27.910] that
[00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:28.470] conversion,
[00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:30.290] especially
[00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:30.650] if
[00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.890] you
[00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:31.770] have
[00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:32.110] always
[00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:32.370] thought
[00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:32.670] about
[00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.950] things
[00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:33.150] in
[00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.470] terms
[00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.830] of
[00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:34.650] inches.
[00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:35.010] Yes?
[00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.330] I
[00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:35.590] think
[00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:35.730] you
[00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:35.910] meant
[00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:36.030] to
[00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:36.170] write
[00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.730] centimeters.
[00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:37.390] What?
[00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:38.090] Did
[00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:38.210] you
[00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:38.370] mean
[00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:38.490] to
[00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:38.630] write
[00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:39.150] centimeters?
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:42.640] You're
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:42.940] right.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:43.700] I
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:43.860] had
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:44.600] 2
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.220].5
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:46.780] centimeters.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.040] Yeah,
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:49.600] 254
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.080] millimeters.
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:51.220] You're
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:51.420] right.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.180] OK,
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:52.520] sorry
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:52.820] about
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:53.020] that.
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:53.780] Very
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:53.960] good.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:54.220] Thank
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:54.320] you
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:54.480] for
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:54.760] pointing
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.000] that
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:55.240] out.
[00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:56.740] OK,
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.060] so
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:57.440] now
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.100] what
[00:59:59.100 --> 00:59:59.240] we
[00:59:59.240 --> 00:59:59.340] are
[00:59:59.340 --> 00:59:59.500] going
[00:59:59.500 --> 00:59:59.640] to
[00:59:59.640 --> 00:59:59.840] do
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.260] next
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:00.760] is
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:00.900] we're
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.060] going
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:01.220] to
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:01.480] move
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:01.900] on.
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:02.560] And
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:02.920] I'll
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.180] tell
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:03.300] you
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:03.520] another
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:03.960] clever
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.580] experiments
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:04.820] that
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.540] had
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:05.760] been
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.100] done.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:08.240] These
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:08.640] people
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:08.900] here,
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:09.360] McRane
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:09.520] and
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:09.700] all,
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:10.900] developed
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.140] a
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:11.540] method
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.080] which
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:12.460] enabled
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:12.680] them
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:12.860] to
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:13.620] selectively
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.240] label
[01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.960] the
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.260] blue
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:15.560] cells
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:15.720] in
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:15.880] the
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.200] retina.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:17.720] And
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.000] this
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:18.360] shows
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:18.560] a
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:18.860] picture
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:19.140] of
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:19.420] that.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:19.820] All
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:19.980] the
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:20.240] rest
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:20.380] of
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:20.600] them
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.600] are
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:21.800] red
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:21.960] and
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.200] green
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:22.680] cells.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:23.100] OK?
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:23.700] So
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:23.960] only
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.220] one
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:24.420] out
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:24.600] of
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.140] eight
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:32.940] cones
[01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:33.540] is
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:36.200] in
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:36.380] the
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.360] foveal
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:37.820] area,
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:38.980] near
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:39.420] foveal
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:39.720] area.
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:39.940] I
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:40.120] should
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:40.380] say
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:40.600] this
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:40.740] is
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:41.060] both
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:41.220] the
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:41.520] fovea
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:41.600] and
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:41.720] the
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.580] perifovea
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:43.360] is
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.160] black.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:45.700] The
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:45.940] rest
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:46.040] of
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:46.180] them
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:46.260] are
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:46.400] red
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:46.540] and
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:46.800] green
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:47.260] cones.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:48.200] OK?
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.240] Now,
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.540] let's
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:52.440] become
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.020] specific
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:53.400] about
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:53.620] the
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:53.980] facts
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:54.300] here.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.000] And
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:55.240] tell
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:55.380] you,
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:55.660] first
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:55.840] of
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.060] all,
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:56.520] that
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:56.880] one
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.420] degree,
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:58.480] roughly
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:58.760] one
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.120] degree,
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:00:59.940] which
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:00.080] I
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:00.300] pointed
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:00.540] out
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:00.700] is
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:00.900] like
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.060] a
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:01.280] thumb,
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.140] comprises
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:04.860] 200
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:05.640] microns
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.420] on
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:06.700] the
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:06.980] retinal
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:07.500] surface.
[01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:09.150] The

[01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:10.210] distance
[01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:10.390] in
[01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.590] the
[01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:11.210] fovea
[01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:11.950] is
[01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:12.210] only
[01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:12.510] 2
[01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:13.310].4
[01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:14.190] microns.
[01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.850] OK?
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:17.660] Whereas,
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:18.440] when
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:18.680] you,
[01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:19.870] well,
[01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.470] and
[01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:21.710] per
[01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:22.110] square
[01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:22.970] millimeter,
[01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:23.230] I
[01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.410] already
[01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:23.830] mentioned
[01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:24.110] this,
[01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.530] you
[01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.650] have
[01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.850] about
[01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:25.550] 200
[01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:26.730],000
[01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:27.310] cones.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:28.900] You
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:29.080] go
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:29.280] out
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:29.620] five
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.100] degrees,
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:30.380] that
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:30.800] reduces
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.760] tenfold.
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:32.800] And
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.140] then,
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.100] this
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:34.260] I
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:34.420] already
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:34.760] pointed
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.040] out
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:35.140] to
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:35.240] you
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:35.520] several
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:35.980] times.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:36.260] That's
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:36.340] a
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:36.460] good
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:36.640] thing
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:36.780] to
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.180] remember.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.120] And
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:38.320] one
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:38.460] thing
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:38.600] I
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:38.820] haven't
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:39.140] mentioned
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:39.520] before
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:39.780] is
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:39.920] that
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.060] if
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:40.140] you
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:40.300] look
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:40.400] at
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:40.500] a
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:40.800] 12
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:41.100]-font
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:41.520] letter,
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:42.400] I,
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:43.760] when
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:43.920] you
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.080] look
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.240] at
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:44.340] it
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:44.640] at
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.060] 23
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:45.800] centimeters,
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.200] that
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:47.740] activates
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:48.040] about
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:48.400] 80
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:48.760] cones.
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:49.040] So
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:49.160] that
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:49.380] gives
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:49.480] you
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:49.720] sort
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:49.800] of
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:49.960] a
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.360] handle
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.160] on
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:51.960] what
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.100] is
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:52.240] the
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:52.500] nature
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:52.740] of
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.260] activation
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:53.620] there.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:54.640] And
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:54.800] I
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.000] already
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:55.280] said
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:55.460] that
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:55.720] several
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.180] times,
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:56.440] namely
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:56.720] that
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.040] each
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:57.340] rod
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:57.640] has
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.160] 1
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:58.520],000
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:58.900] disks,
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:01:59.780] and
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.240] each
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:00.880] disk
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:01.740] in
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:01.940] it
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.360] has
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.080] 10
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:03.600],000
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.800] molecules.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.040] OK.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:06.960] And
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.320] as
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:07.520] I've
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:07.760] just
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.240] mentioned,
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.120] one
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:09.500] out
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:09.640] of
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:09.940] eight
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.260] cones
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:10.440] is
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:10.700] blue.
[01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.460] The
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:11.800] others
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:12.280] are
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:12.740] fairly
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.020] equal
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:13.180] in
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:13.480] number,
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:13.760] but
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.100] varies
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:14.360] from
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:14.680] person
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:14.900] to
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:15.260] person.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:16.480] OK.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:16.840] So
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.300] now,
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.820] we
[01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.710] are
[01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.990] going
[01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.310] to
[01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:22.610] tell
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:23.880] you
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.480] about
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:24.840] yet
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.900] another
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.820] experiment.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:27.620] And
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:27.740] in
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:27.960] this,
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:28.400] this
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:28.520] is
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:28.660] an
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:29.120] incredibly
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:29.500] clever
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:30.080] experiment
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:30.580] that
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:30.760] was
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:31.080] carried
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:31.440] out
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.140] by
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:32.900] Ursula
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:33.820] Drager.
[01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:35.440] At
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:35.700] that
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:35.960] time,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:36.100] when
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:36.200] she
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:36.380] did
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:36.560] this
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:36.920] beautiful
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:37.480] experiment,
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:37.960] she
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.140] did
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:38.380] this
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:38.600] at
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.080] Harvard,
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:39.300] at
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:39.400] the
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:39.560] Harvard
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:39.900] Medical
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.280] School.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:40.740] And
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.260] what
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:41.540] she
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:41.780] did
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.020] was
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:42.300] this.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.320] She
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:43.760] took
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.020] the
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:44.300] word
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:44.920] fiat
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.400] lux,
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:46.080] put
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:46.320] it
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.720] on
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.600] a
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.140] screen,
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:49.960] and
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.580] exposed
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.580] it
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:52.420] to
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:52.860] a
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:53.140] dark
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:53.640]-adapted
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.060] animal,
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:54.540] and
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:54.780] the
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:54.960] animal
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.280] being
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:55.480] a
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:55.820] mouse.
[01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.930] And
[01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:58.410] then,
[01:02:58.650 --> 01:02:58.910] her
[01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:59.310] procedure
[01:02:59.310 --> 01:02:59.850] enabled
[01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:00.270] her
[01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:00.730] to
[01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:01.270] label,
[01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:01.950] using
[01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:02.970] a
[01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:03.490] monoclonal
[01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:03.830] antibody
[01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:04.390] label,
[01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:05.070] those
[01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:05.630] cells
[01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:06.050] that
[01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:06.230] had
[01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.430] been
[01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:06.990] activated
[01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:07.450] by
[01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:07.930] fiat
[01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:08.350] lux.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:09.620] OK.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:10.440] So
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:10.760] this
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:10.960] is
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.280] then
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:11.900] what
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.120] she,
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:12.480] this
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:12.940] is
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:13.080] the
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:13.440] actual
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:13.940] retina,
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:14.320] flat
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:14.640]-mounted
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:14.960] retina,
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:15.680] showing
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:15.980] you
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.460] what
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:16.640] had
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:16.820] been
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:17.400] activated.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:18.620] Now,
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:18.860] that's
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:19.400] remarkable,
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.160] beautiful.
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:21.400] And
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:21.980] she
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.800] came
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.380] and
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:23.620] gave
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:23.780] a
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:24.080] talk
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:24.240] here
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:24.360] at
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:24.740] MIT,
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.160] maybe
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:25.520] about
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.060] 15
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:26.340] years
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:26.640] ago.
[01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:29.090] And
[01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:29.470] when
[01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.630] she
[01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:30.110] presented
[01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:30.470] this
[01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.950] picture,
[01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:31.890] one
[01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:31.990] of
[01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.170] the
[01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:32.710] students,
[01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:33.690] it
[01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:33.930] wasn't
[01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:34.150] any
[01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.270] of
[01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:34.450] you,
[01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:34.610] I
[01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:34.930] guess,
[01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:36.950] raised
[01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:37.770] her
[01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:38.170] hand
[01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:38.250] and
[01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:38.430] was
[01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.690] very
[01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:39.210] upset.
[01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:39.830] He
[01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:39.950] said,
[01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:40.190] ah,
[01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:40.390] but,
[01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:40.630] but,
[01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.830] but,
[01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:41.070] but,
[01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:41.210] but,
[01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:41.330] but,
[01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:41.490] but,
[01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:41.530] but,
[01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:41.710] but.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:43.560] And
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:43.940] so
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:44.380] Ursula
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:44.700] said,
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.400] yes?
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.180] So
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:46.320] what
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:46.380] do
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:46.520] you
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:46.840] think
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.140] this
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:47.420] patient,
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:47.760] this
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.260] subject
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:48.740] asked,
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:50.880] this
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.360] listener
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.080] asked?
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.120] Well,
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:54.640] this
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:54.800] was
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:54.900] a
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:55.080] very
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:55.440] active
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:55.940] thinker.
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:56.680] This
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.500] person
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:57.940] said,
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:03:58.640] but,
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:58.840] but,
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.100] but,
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:03:59.560] was
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.040] this
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:00.300] image
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:00.540] right
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:00.720] side
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:00.900] up
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.020] on
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:01.140] the
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:01.380] retinal
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:01.800] surface?
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.180] That
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:03.360] was
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:03.460] the
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:03.840] question.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:04.880] And
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.260] Ursula
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:05.620] Drager
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:06.340] said,
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.160] no,
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:07.400] it
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:07.560] was
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:07.880] upside
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.460] down.
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:08.800] I
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.080] just
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:09.640] rotated
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.060] it
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:10.600] 180
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.120] degrees
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:11.300] so
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:11.420] you
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:11.560] can
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:11.820] see
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:12.080] it.
[01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:13.170] All
[01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:13.330] right?
[01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:15.370] Well,
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.540] interestingly
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:19.100] enough,
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:21.020] there
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:21.200] were
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:21.600] times
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:21.760] when
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:21.940] this
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:22.380] became
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:22.620] an
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:23.000] issue.
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:23.640] First
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:23.780] of
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:23.920] all,
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:24.340] before,
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:24.980] people
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:25.300] knew
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:25.740] about
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.720] lenses
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.340] and
[01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:27.540] that
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:27.820] lenses
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.120] turn
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:28.460] images
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:28.820] upside
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.400] down.
[01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:33.670] And
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.660] secondly,
[01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:36.830] because
[01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.170] many
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:38.640] people
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:39.380] didn't
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:39.920] believe
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.140] that
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:40.260] the
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:40.520] images
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:40.740] were
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.040] upside
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:41.240] down
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:41.380] on
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:41.460] the
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:41.760] retina.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:42.600] I
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:42.700] mean,
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:42.780] if
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.060] images
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:43.260] are
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:43.560] upside
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:43.800] down
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:43.920] on
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.020] the
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:44.320] retina,
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:44.580] they're
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:44.840] upside
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.160] down
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.100] on
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:46.260] your
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:46.680] brain.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.280] And
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:47.460] yet,
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:47.660] the
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:47.860] world
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:48.020] is
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:48.260] right
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:48.520] side
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:48.840] up.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.440] What's
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:51.600] going
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:51.820] on?
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:52.540] So
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.960] I
[01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:54.430] would
[01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.710] say
[01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:55.170] about
[01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:56.390] eight
[01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:56.670] or
[01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.890] 10
[01:04:56.890 --> 01:04:57.170] years
[01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.530] ago,
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:04:59.980] I
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:00.220] was
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:00.900] asked
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.000] to
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.640] review
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:05.080] a
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:05.400] paper
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.200] for
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:06.360] a
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:06.580] high
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:07.120] visibility
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.060] journal.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.220] I
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:09.840] can't
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.020] name
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:10.200] the
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:10.500] journal.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.240] In
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:12.580] which
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.520] the
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.240] investigator
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.640] very,
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:16.140] very
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.760] vociferously
[01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:19.810] proclaimed
[01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:21.070] that
[01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:21.310] we
[01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:21.450] have
[01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:21.890] all
[01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:22.130] been
[01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.630] wrong
[01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:23.130] and
[01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:23.270] that
[01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.430] the
[01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.730] images
[01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:24.030] are
[01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:24.250] right
[01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:24.430] side
[01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.570] up
[01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:24.690] on
[01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:24.810] the
[01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:25.070] retina
[01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:25.430] after
[01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.670] all.
[01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:26.810] So
[01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:27.010] what
[01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:27.210] was
[01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:27.370] his
[01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:28.410] proof?
[01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:29.210] Well,
[01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:29.390] his
[01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.710] proof
[01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:30.130] was
[01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:31.270] that
[01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.930] he
[01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:32.290] took
[01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:32.650] an
[01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:32.990] ox
[01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.350] eye,
[01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.570] a
[01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:34.210] slaughtered
[01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:34.730] ox's
[01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:35.170] eye,
[01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.810] and
[01:05:35.810 --> 01:05:36.050] cut
[01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:36.270] out
[01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:36.410] a
[01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:36.550] little
[01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:36.870] piece
[01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:37.010] in
[01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:37.130] the
[01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:37.350] back
[01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:37.490] of
[01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:37.610] the
[01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:37.930] eye
[01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:38.450] and
[01:05:38.450 --> 01:05:38.690] put
[01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.850] a
[01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:39.330] translucent
[01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:40.270] piece
[01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:40.430] of
[01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.710] paper
[01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:41.010] over
[01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:41.290] it
[01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.950] and
[01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:42.130] then
[01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:42.710] presented
[01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:43.530] a
[01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:43.930] stimulus
[01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:44.250] out
[01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:44.510] there.
[01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:44.950] And
[01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:45.050] when
[01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:45.150] he
[01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.390] looked
[01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.610] at
[01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:46.130] the
[01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.430] back
[01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.570] of
[01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:46.710] the
[01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:47.030] eye,
[01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:47.890] at
[01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:48.010] the
[01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:48.470] translucent
[01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.950] part,
[01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:49.410] the
[01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:49.630] image
[01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:49.790] was
[01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:50.030] right
[01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.250] side
[01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:50.550] up.
[01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.930] A
[01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:51.030] little
[01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:51.210] bit
[01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:51.690] blurred,
[01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:51.890] but
[01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:52.150] right
[01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.370] side
[01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.610] up.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:53.760] And
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:53.960] so
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.200] he
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:54.500] felt
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.140] that
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:55.740] he
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:56.180] proved
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:56.400] that
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:56.920] images
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.260] are
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:57.500] right
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:57.680] side
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:57.880] up
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.000] on
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:58.120] the
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:58.340] retina
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:05:58.660] after
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:58.860] all.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.280] Well,
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:00.520] I
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:00.700] was
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:01.360] flabbergasted.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:02.460] And
[01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:02.620] it
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:02.820] took
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:02.960] me
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.220] quite
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:03.380] a
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:03.600] while
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:03.800] to
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.060] figure
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:04.560] out
[01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.870] why
[01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:06.110] this
[01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:06.330] guy
[01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:06.610] got
[01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:06.810] what
[01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:06.970] he
[01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:07.290] got.
[01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:07.550] Because
[01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:07.850] he'd
[01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:08.190] obviously
[01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:08.510] got
[01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.670] what
[01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.810] he
[01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:09.130] got.
[01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:09.830] So
[01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:10.310] can
[01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:10.450] you
[01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:10.670] guys
[01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.950] think
[01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:11.090] of
[01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:11.290] any
[01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:11.650] reason
[01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:11.850] for
[01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:12.130] this?
[01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.890] How
[01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:13.070] come
[01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:13.210] he
[01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:13.390] got
[01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.530] what
[01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:13.650] he
[01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:13.930] got?
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:17.020] He
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:17.500] took
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:17.740] the
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.180] eye,
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.700] and
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:20.840] in
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:20.920] the
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.140] back
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:21.260] he
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:21.460] cut
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:21.620] out
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:21.740] a
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:21.880] little
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.300] opening
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:22.900] and
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.060] put
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:23.180] a
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.040] transparency
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:24.560] over
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:24.840] it.
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:25.360] So
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:25.580] then
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:25.900] anything
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:26.160] came
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:26.320] in
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:26.440] there,
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:26.560] you
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:26.720] could
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.600] see
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.120] what
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.920] would
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.100] have
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:30.480] been
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:30.980] normally
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:31.960] on
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.120] the
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:32.360] retinal
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:32.840] surface.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:33.700] I
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:33.800] mean,
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:33.880] it
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:33.920] was
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.040] a
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:34.240] clever
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:34.780] experiment.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:35.060] No
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:35.380] question
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:35.680] about
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.000] that.
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.180] So
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:37.380] but
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:37.520] what
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:37.720] was
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:37.900] wrong
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:38.040] with
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:38.140] the
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:38.540] experiment?
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.120] Well,
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:40.440] I'll
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:40.620] tell
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:40.780] you.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:41.780] What
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:41.940] was
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:42.180] wrong
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:42.340] with
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:42.460] the
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.020] experiment
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:43.720] goes
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.000] back
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:44.180] to
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:44.300] what
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:44.440] I
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:44.700] told
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:44.820] you
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.280] before
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:45.860] about
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:46.180] the
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:46.480] way
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.840] the
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.180] lens
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:49.660] works,
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:50.020] right?
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:50.620] The
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:50.880] lens
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.180] works
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:51.500] so
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:51.820] that
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:51.960] when
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.060] you
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:52.220] look
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:52.380] at
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:52.700] something
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.340] close,
[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:54.080] the
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:54.500] muscles
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.140] of
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:55.300] the
[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:55.580] lens
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:55.940] are
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:56.180] such
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:56.300] that
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:56.420] it
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:56.640] makes
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:56.800] the
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.000] lens
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:57.480] fat.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:58.740] And
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:06:58.900] when
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:06:59.060] the
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:06:59.400] muscles
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.700] relax,
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.200] it
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:01.520] makes
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.000] the
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.780] lens
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:06.220] thick.
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:07.740] Sorry,
[01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:08.220] thin,
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:08.780] OK?
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:09.380] So
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:09.700] that
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.340] means,
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:11.300] just
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:11.440] to
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:11.640] be
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.360] graphic
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:12.780] about
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:13.040] it,
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.140] is
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:15.760] that
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.300] if
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:16.460] you
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:16.860] have
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:17.560] a
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:17.840] thick
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.320] lens,
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:19.320] you
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:19.600] have
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.080] a
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:20.640] short
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.880] focal
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:23.320] length.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:24.020] And
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:24.160] if
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:24.260] you
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:24.360] have
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:24.540] a
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:24.840] thin
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.320] lens,
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:27.400] you
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:27.520] have
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:27.620] a
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:27.840] much
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:28.300] longer
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:28.680] focal
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.000] length
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:29.260] like
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:29.700] that,
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:30.380] OK?
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.600] So
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.020] now
[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:32.600] if
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:32.800] you
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:33.660] look
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:33.920] at
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.200] the
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.720] back
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:39.620] of
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:39.780] the
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:40.060] eye
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:40.420] here,
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:40.640] where
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:40.780] the
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:41.540] photoreceptors
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:41.800] are,
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:42.260] in
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:42.500] this
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:42.940] case,
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:43.740] it
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:43.940] looks
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:44.140] like
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:44.280] it's
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:44.420] with
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:44.520] the
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:44.820] upside
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.240] down.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:45.580] But
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:45.740] if
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:45.880] they
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:45.980] were
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.060] in
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:46.200] the
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:46.420] same
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:46.840] distance
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:47.280] here,
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:47.760] it
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:47.760] would
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:47.920] be
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.220] blurred,
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:48.420] and
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:48.500] it
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:48.600] would
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:48.940] remain
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.440] right
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:49.740] side
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:50.000] up,
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:50.480] just
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:50.700] like
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:50.840] it
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.020] is
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:51.160] with
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:51.280] a
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:51.760] magnifying
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.240] glass,
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.000] OK?
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:53.720] So
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:53.900] what
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:54.140] this
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:54.340] guy
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:54.700] didn't
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:55.200] know
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:55.640] is
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.320] the
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:56.720] rule
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:56.960] of
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:57.440] how
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.140] the
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:58.500] muscle
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.040] works
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:07:59.640] in
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:07:59.800] the
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.120] eye
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:00.740] to
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:01.700] control
[01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:02.440] the
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:02.840] lens.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:03.600] And
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:03.760] when
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:03.940] the
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:04.300] animal
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:04.660] was
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:05.800] killed,
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:07.440] it
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:07.920] no
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.280] longer
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:08.880] had
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:09.620] the
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.440] lens
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.000] at
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:11.160] the
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:11.440] proper
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.140] focal
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:13.220] depth,
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.140] OK?
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:14.380] And
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:14.700] therefore,
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:14.900] the
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:15.160] image
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:15.320] was
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:15.540] right
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:15.780] side
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.040] up.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:16.960] So
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.400] therefore,
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:17.720] guess
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:17.880] what
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.280] happened?
[01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:20.390] I
[01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:21.250] wrote
[01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:21.610] back
[01:08:21.610 --> 01:08:21.870] to
[01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:22.390] this
[01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.810] high
[01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:23.090] visibility
[01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.530] journal
[01:08:23.530 --> 01:08:23.950] saying
[01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:24.350] that
[01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:24.570] this
[01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:24.770] guy
[01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:25.410] is
[01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:25.910] wrong
[01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:26.490] for
[01:08:26.490 --> 01:08:26.770] this
[01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:27.190] reason.
[01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.690] OK,
[01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:29.670] so
[01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:30.890] that
[01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:31.070] was
[01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.370] certainly
[01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.550] an
[01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.870] interesting
[01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:32.670] experience.
[01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:33.110] And
[01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.390] that's
[01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:33.630] why
[01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:34.550] I
[01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:35.830] managed
[01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:36.090] to
[01:08:36.090 --> 01:08:36.510] learn
[01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.690] a
[01:08:36.690 --> 01:08:36.830] little
[01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:37.190] bit
[01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:38.330] about
[01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:38.830] how
[01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:38.990] the
[01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.310] lens
[01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:39.810] works
[01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:40.650] in
[01:08:40.650 --> 01:08:41.370] the
[01:08:41.370 --> 01:08:41.830] eye,
[01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:42.130] which
[01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:42.290] is
[01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:42.450] a
[01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:42.910] remarkable
[01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:43.390] way
[01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.530] it
[01:08:43.530 --> 01:08:43.950] works,
[01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.950] since
[01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:45.150] it's
[01:08:45.150 --> 01:08:45.330] so
[01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:45.670] totally
[01:08:45.670 --> 01:08:46.030] different
[01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.290] from
[01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:46.490] what
[01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.650] we
[01:08:46.650 --> 01:08:46.770] are
[01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:47.150] familiar
[01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.530] with
[01:08:47.530 --> 01:08:48.310] when
[01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:48.450] it
[01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:48.650] comes
[01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:48.830] to
[01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:49.210] cameras.
[01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:50.130] OK,
[01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:50.610] so
[01:08:50.610 --> 01:08:50.990] now
[01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.550] let's
[01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.830] go
[01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:52.070] to
[01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.290] the
[01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:52.670] next
[01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:53.190] step,
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.040] one
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:55.480] down
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.160] from
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.640] your
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.680] photoreceptors.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:01.040] And
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:01.120] we
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:01.400] come
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:01.620] to
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:01.800] the
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.000] so
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:02.200]-called
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.260] bipolar
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:03.740] cells.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.060] Here's
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:04.220] a
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:04.480] series
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:04.780] of
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:05.300] pictures
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:05.820] of
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:05.960] the
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.100] so
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:06.300]-called
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:06.660] cat
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.120] bipolar
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:07.700] cells.
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:08.440] And
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:08.660] what
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:08.860] was
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.440] discovered
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:09.940] is
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:10.560] that
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:10.740] the
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:11.160] bipolar
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:11.580] cells
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:11.840] here,
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:12.540] in
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:12.660] the
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:12.820] outer

[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:13.940] they
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.420] connect
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:14.980] with
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:15.100] the
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:15.900] photoreceptors.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:16.680] And
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:16.880] the
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.120] inner
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:17.600] plexiform
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.140] layer,
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:18.660] their
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:19.060] axonal
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:19.740] projections
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:20.080] are
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:20.400] such
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:20.980] that
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:21.140] in
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:21.320] the
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:21.580] upper
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.040] layer
[01:09:22.710 --> 01:09:23.890] here,
[01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:25.030] which
[01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.230] is
[01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:25.890] IPL
[01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:26.630] layer
[01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:27.070] A,
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:28.820] the
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:29.280] cells
[01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:31.710] there
[01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:32.150] are
[01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.510] off
[01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.910] cells.
[01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.150] And
[01:09:33.150 --> 01:09:33.270] the
[01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:33.550] ones
[01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.810] that
[01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:34.530] project
[01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:34.910] below
[01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:35.270] this
[01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:35.570] here
[01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:36.030] are
[01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.190] the
[01:09:36.190 --> 01:09:36.350] so
[01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:36.550]-called
[01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.910] on
[01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:37.350] cells.
[01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:37.850] So
[01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:38.150] there's
[01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:38.290] a
[01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:38.870] separation
[01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:39.210] of
[01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:39.350] the
[01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:39.510] so
[01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.690]-called
[01:09:39.690 --> 01:09:40.110] on
[01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:40.570] and
[01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:40.870] off
[01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:41.510] cells
[01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.290] at
[01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:42.470] the
[01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.950] bipolar
[01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:43.310] cell
[01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:43.650] level
[01:09:43.650 --> 01:09:44.090] in
[01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.230] the
[01:09:44.230 --> 01:09:44.470] manner
[01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.650] in
[01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:44.810] which
[01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:44.990] they
[01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.530] connect.
[01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:46.090] And
[01:09:46.090 --> 01:09:46.270] so
[01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:46.690] therefore,
[01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:47.210] those
[01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:47.970] ganglion
[01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:48.350] cells
[01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:48.550] that
[01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:49.150] connect
[01:09:49.150 --> 01:09:49.450] with
[01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:49.770] these
[01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:50.210] are
[01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:50.430] off
[01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.750] ganglion
[01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:51.190] cells.
[01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:51.590] And
[01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.770] those
[01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:51.910] that
[01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:52.930] connect
[01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:53.190] with
[01:09:53.190 --> 01:09:53.450] these
[01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:54.070] are
[01:09:54.230 --> 01:09:55.250] on
[01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:55.790] ganglion
[01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:56.310] cells.
[01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.250] All
[01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:57.410] right,
[01:09:57.490 --> 01:09:57.590] so
[01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.910] that's
[01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:58.890] basically
[01:09:58.890 --> 01:09:59.230] out
[01:09:59.230 --> 01:09:59.270] of
[01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.410] the
[01:09:59.410 --> 01:09:59.790] bipolar
[01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:00.250] cells.
[01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:00.850] And
[01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:01.050] then
[01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:01.210] when
[01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:01.250] you
[01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.410] come
[01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:01.530] to
[01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:01.670] the
[01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:02.150] horizontal
[01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:02.730] cells,
[01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:03.290] here's
[01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:04.130] a
[01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:04.650] beautiful
[01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:05.190] example
[01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:05.970] of
[01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:06.430] a

[01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:11.230] horizontal
[01:10:11.230 --> 01:10:11.750] cell.
[01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:12.770] And
[01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:12.950] if
[01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:13.150] that
[01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:13.330] is
[01:10:13.330 --> 01:10:13.490] then
[01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:13.950] analyzed
[01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:14.270] in
[01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.870] detail,
[01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:15.910] it
[01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:16.130] looks
[01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.490] something
[01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.810] like
[01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:17.230] this.
[01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.710] This
[01:10:17.710 --> 01:10:18.150] particular
[01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:18.790] cell
[01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:19.850] has
[01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:22.130] 15
[01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:23.030] connections
[01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:25.310] with
[01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:26.070] the
[01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.990] photoreceptors.
[01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.850] And
[01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:28.190] these
[01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:28.550] cells,
[01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:28.770] I
[01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:29.350] might
[01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.470] as
[01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:29.510] well
[01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:30.030] anticipate,
[01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:30.350] we'll
[01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.610] talk
[01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:30.870] about
[01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:31.030] that
[01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.150] in
[01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:31.330] more
[01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:31.650] detail
[01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:32.030] later,
[01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.870] they
[01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:34.150] play
[01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:34.370] a
[01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.690] central
[01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:34.990] role
[01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.150] in
[01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:35.490] providing

[01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:37.790] that
[01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.950] I
[01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:38.370] described
[01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:38.570] to
[01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.710] you
[01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:38.910] for
[01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:39.150] those
[01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:39.410] retinal
[01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:39.850] ganglion
[01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:40.290] cells.
[01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:41.270] Then
[01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.470] if
[01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.590] you
[01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:42.030] proceed
[01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.250] to
[01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:42.490] the
[01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:42.950] amacrine
[01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:43.390] cells,
[01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.990] and
[01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.310] again,
[01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:45.010] things
[01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:45.130] are
[01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:45.330] so
[01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:45.850] complicated,
[01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.090] the
[01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:46.770] numerous,
[01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.390] numerous
[01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.270] amacrine
[01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.770] cells,
[01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:49.850] different
[01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:50.350] types.
[01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:51.090] And
[01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:51.230] they
[01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:51.390] have
[01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.590] been
[01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.870] studied
[01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:52.530] extensively.
[01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:52.790] There
[01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.870] are
[01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:53.070] more
[01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.210] than
[01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:53.570] 20.
[01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:55.590] And
[01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.870] here's
[01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:56.070] a
[01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.490] clever
[01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:57.110] experiment
[01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.330] I
[01:10:57.330 --> 01:10:57.570] thought
[01:10:57.570 --> 01:10:57.910] I'd
[01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:58.190] point
[01:10:58.190 --> 01:10:58.430] out
[01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.590] to
[01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.730] you.
[01:10:58.730 --> 01:10:59.230] What
[01:10:59.230 --> 01:10:59.430] you
[01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.670] can
[01:10:59.670 --> 01:10:59.930] do
[01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:00.430] here,
[01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:01.010] if
[01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.190] you
[01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:01.670] look
[01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:01.830] at
[01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.990] the
[01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.190] so
[01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:02.430]-called
[01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:03.470] cholinergic
[01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.910] amacrine
[01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:04.410] cells,
[01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.890] that's
[01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:05.090] one
[01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.650] class,
[01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:06.810] you
[01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:07.030] can
[01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.810] selectively
[01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:08.270] label
[01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.510] them
[01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.830] because
[01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:09.050] they're
[01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:09.630] cholinergic.
[01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:10.050] And
[01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:10.270] here's
[01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:10.370] an
[01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.770] example
[01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:10.930] of
[01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:11.590] all
[01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.970] those
[01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:12.470] lighter
[01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.790] blue
[01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:13.110] ones
[01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:14.490] are
[01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:14.930] your
[01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:15.570] cholinergic
[01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:16.010] cells.
[01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.530] And
[01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:16.830] then
[01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:17.030] what
[01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.170] you
[01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:17.330] can
[01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.470] do,
[01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:17.570] you
[01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:17.690] can
[01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:17.850] put
[01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:18.050] this
[01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.230] under
[01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:18.430] a
[01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:18.830] microscope.
[01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.770] And
[01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:19.950] then
[01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:20.110] you
[01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:20.310] can
[01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.770] lower
[01:11:20.770 --> 01:11:21.310] a
[01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:22.090] microelectrode
[01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:22.570] into
[01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:22.910] one
[01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:23.030] of
[01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.210] these
[01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:23.530] cells,
[01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:23.750] just
[01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.970] like
[01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:24.150] I've
[01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:24.290] done
[01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:24.630] here.
[01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:25.230] And
[01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:25.370] if
[01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:25.490] you
[01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.650] look
[01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:25.790] at
[01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.990] this
[01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.350] closely,
[01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.610] this
[01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:26.750] is
[01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.910] not
[01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:27.090] the
[01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:27.330] best
[01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:27.510] of
[01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.850] pictures.
[01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:28.430] This
[01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.670] is
[01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:28.830] the
[01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:29.250] labeled,
[01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:29.690] again,
[01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.910] purple
[01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:30.090] and
[01:11:30.090 --> 01:11:30.310] yellow
[01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:31.110] labeled
[01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.690] cell,
[01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:32.510] amacrine
[01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.850] cell.
[01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:33.230] You
[01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:33.390] can
[01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.570] see
[01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:33.690] it
[01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:33.810] has
[01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:33.990] all
[01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.150] these
[01:11:34.150 --> 01:11:34.710] processes.
[01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:35.430] So
[01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.710] then
[01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:36.530] if
[01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:36.610] you
[01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:36.770] look
[01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.890] at
[01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:37.050] this
[01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:37.170] on
[01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:37.290] the
[01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:37.750] microscope
[01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:38.030] on
[01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.130] the
[01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:38.330] high
[01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.750] quality,
[01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.270] you
[01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.570] can
[01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:41.870] draw
[01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:42.170] these
[01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:42.510] out.
[01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:42.930] And
[01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:43.150] this
[01:11:43.150 --> 01:11:43.310] is
[01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.510] what
[01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.690] they
[01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:43.930] look
[01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:44.290] like,
[01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:44.710] OK?
[01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:45.670] So
[01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:45.950] this
[01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:46.110] is
[01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.290] a
[01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:46.930] cholinergic
[01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:47.390] cell.
[01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:48.570] This
[01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:48.750] is
[01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:49.130] another
[01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:49.610] type,
[01:11:49.690 --> 01:11:49.770] which
[01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:49.890] is
[01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:50.130] called
[01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:50.630] A2,
[01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:51.110] which
[01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.230] has
[01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:51.350] a
[01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.510] lot
[01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.670] to
[01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:51.850] do
[01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:52.170] with
[01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:53.510] rods.
[01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:54.210] And
[01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:54.410] then
[01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.530] you
[01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:54.630] have
[01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.970] another
[01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:55.410] class
[01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:55.670] called
[01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:55.950] open
[01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:56.470] immunergic.
[01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.690] I'm
[01:11:56.690 --> 01:11:56.810] not
[01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:56.950] going
[01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:57.010] to
[01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:57.370] go
[01:11:57.370 --> 01:11:57.530] into
[01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:57.970] detail
[01:11:57.970 --> 01:11:58.270] about
[01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:58.490] it.
[01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.830] But
[01:11:58.830 --> 01:11:58.950] you
[01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:59.110] can
[01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.390] see
[01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.610] that
[01:11:59.610 --> 01:11:59.870] each
[01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:00.030] of
[01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.290] these
[01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:00.710] now,
[01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.390] scientific
[01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:01.910] methods
[01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:02.330] enabled
[01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.650] you
[01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:03.210] to
[01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:04.110] specify
[01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.790] what
[01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:05.050] these
[01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:05.430] amacrine
[01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.770] cells
[01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:05.970] are
[01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:06.290] like.
[01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:06.650] And
[01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:06.750] the
[01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:07.030] basis
[01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.250] of
[01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:07.490] that,
[01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:08.010] people
[01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:08.150] have
[01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:08.330] come
[01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.490] up
[01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:08.630] with
[01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.990] ideas
[01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.330] what
[01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:09.810] the
[01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:10.130] amacrine
[01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:10.810] system
[01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:11.230] does.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:12.820] OK,
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:13.420] now
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:13.900] we
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:14.200] come
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:14.620] to
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:14.840] the
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.160] crux
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:15.360] of
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:15.660] things
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:15.900] in
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:16.380] the
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:16.900] last
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:17.360] few
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:17.780] minutes.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:18.340] We're
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:18.340] going
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:18.380] to
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:18.600] talk
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:18.860] about
[01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:19.100] the
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:19.700] electrical
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.620] responses
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:21.260] in
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:21.420] the
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:21.740] retina.
[01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.910] Now
[01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:23.210] this
[01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:23.990] is
[01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.350] going
[01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.430] to
[01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:24.830] be,
[01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:25.210] again,
[01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.630] fairly
[01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:26.290] complicated.
[01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:27.390] This
[01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.810] work,
[01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.550] again,
[01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:29.070] remarkable
[01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.650] work,
[01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:30.430] which
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:31.800] in
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.120] my
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:32.400] view
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.060] merits
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:33.240] a
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:33.420] Nobel
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:33.880] Prize,
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:34.920] but
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:35.080] it
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:35.240] has
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:35.460] not
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:35.600] yet
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:35.800] been
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.240] awarded,
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:37.800] to
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.360] John
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:39.920] Dowling
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.240] at
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:40.660] Harvard.
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:44.620] And
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:45.260] let
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:45.380] me
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:45.660] just
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.240] introduce
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:46.500] this
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:46.700] by
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:47.020] telling
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:47.340] you
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:47.580] how
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:47.760] they
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:47.940] went
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:48.220] about
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:48.480] this
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:48.940] experiment.
[01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:51.270] They
[01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.870] realized
[01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:52.090] that
[01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:52.270] the
[01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.590] cells
[01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:52.730] in
[01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:52.910] the
[01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:53.230] retina
[01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:53.490] are
[01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:53.810] very,
[01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:54.070] very
[01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.650] small.
[01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.390] And
[01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.590] so
[01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.850] it's
[01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:56.610] very
[01:12:56.610 --> 01:12:57.070] difficult
[01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.370] to
[01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:57.730] record
[01:12:57.730 --> 01:12:58.010] from
[01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.210] them
[01:12:58.210 --> 01:12:59.170] intracellularly.
[01:12:59.370 --> 01:12:59.630] You
[01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.810] have
[01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.950] to
[01:12:59.950 --> 01:13:00.130] do
[01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:00.390] that
[01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.630] if
[01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:01.210] you
[01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:01.570] want
[01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:01.690] to
[01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:01.870] be
[01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:02.210] able
[01:13:02.210 --> 01:13:02.630] to
[01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:03.010] label
[01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:03.270] them
[01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.930] anatomically.
[01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.770] And
[01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:05.070] so
[01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:05.610] they
[01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:05.950] looked
[01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:06.290] around
[01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.530] for
[01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:06.690] a
[01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:06.990] species
[01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.310] of
[01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.690] animal
[01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:10.130] that
[01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.690] had
[01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:11.210] large
[01:13:11.210 --> 01:13:11.670] cells
[01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:11.870] in
[01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:12.010] the
[01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:12.350] retina.
[01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:12.790] And
[01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.950] they
[01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:13.410] discovered,
[01:13:13.610 --> 01:13:13.730] after
[01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:13.910] a
[01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:14.050] lot
[01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:14.190] of
[01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:14.510] search,
[01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.890] that
[01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:15.050] the
[01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:15.230] so
[01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:15.450]-called
[01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:15.790] mud
[01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:16.190] puppy
[01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:17.150] and
[01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:17.290] the
[01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:17.750] nectereus
[01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:18.910] maculosis
[01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:20.330] is
[01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:21.430] an
[01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.790] animal
[01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:22.030] that
[01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:22.230] has
[01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:22.710] unusually
[01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:23.370] large
[01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:24.290] retinal
[01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.870] ganglion
[01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:25.290] cells.
[01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:26.190] Then
[01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:26.370] they
[01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:26.750] developed
[01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.950] a
[01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:27.350] technique
[01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.850] of
[01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:28.510] removing
[01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.870] the
[01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:29.210] eye
[01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:29.530] from
[01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:30.110] this
[01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.650] animal
[01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:31.370] and
[01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:31.650] putting
[01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:31.870] it
[01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:32.150] into
[01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:32.410] a
[01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:32.790] dish
[01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:33.470] because
[01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.690] that
[01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:33.930] makes
[01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:34.070] it
[01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.230] real
[01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:34.710] stable.
[01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.770] And
[01:13:35.770 --> 01:13:35.970] then
[01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:36.110] they
[01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.270] were
[01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.510] able
[01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.990] to
[01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.510] put
[01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.650] an
[01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:37.930] electrode
[01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:38.230] in
[01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:38.490] there,
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:39.780] define
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:40.060] what
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:40.280] the
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:40.660] cells
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:41.040] did
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.820] functionally
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:42.740] by
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:43.580] shining
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:43.880] light
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.040] on
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:44.160] them
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:44.240] and
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:44.920] looking
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.140] at
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:45.280] their
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:45.700] activity.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:46.540] And
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:47.620] then
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.580] they
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:48.740] were
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:48.920] able
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.160] to
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:49.660] label
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:49.920] the
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.120] cell
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:50.320] by
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:50.920] injecting
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.120] a
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:51.380] labeling
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:51.920] substance.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:52.520] So
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:52.800] that's
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:52.960] what
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.120] they
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:53.460] did.
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:54.340] And
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:55.080] so
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:55.440] here
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:55.740] is
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:55.880] a
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.380] description
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:56.820] of
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:56.980] that
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:57.440] arrangement.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.220] Here
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:58.420] you
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:13:58.840] have
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.340] an
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:13:59.920] inverted
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:00.440] mud
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:00.700] puppy
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:01.160] retina.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:01.700] And
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:01.900] here
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:02.020] you
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:02.160] have
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:02.300] a
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:02.560] DC
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.060] recording
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:03.500] electrode.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:04.340] And
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:04.540] what
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:04.660] you
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:04.860] do
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:05.060] then,
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:05.200] you
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:05.360] look
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:05.480] at
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:05.560] it
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:05.640] in
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:05.720] a
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:06.260] oscilloscope.
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:06.840] And
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.020] at
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:07.260] this
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:07.680] point,
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:08.180] the
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:08.620] cell
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.840] is
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.400] entered
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.280] by
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:11.840] the
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.300] DC
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:12.860] recording.
[01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.760] And
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:13.960] then
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:14.220] once
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:14.420] it's
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:14.880] inside,
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:15.540] cells
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:15.980] inside
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:16.160] are
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:16.660] negatively
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:17.200] charged
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:17.400] with
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:17.720] respect
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:17.940] to
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:18.280] the
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.700] surround,
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.000] usually
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:21.280] up
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:21.360] to
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:21.680] about

[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:23.040] millivolts.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:23.920] In
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.080] this
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:24.300] case,
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:24.420] I
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:24.560] have
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:24.840] 50
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.360] millivolts
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:25.720] labeled.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:26.480] And
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:26.660] so
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:26.980] once
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:27.180] you're
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:27.480] inside
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:27.680] the
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:27.880] cell,
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.020] you
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:28.200] see
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:28.360] a
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:28.620] sudden

[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:29.460] to
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:29.740] a

[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:30.400] level.
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:30.960] And
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:31.120] then
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:31.280] if
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:31.440] the
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:31.800] cell
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.600] discharges
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:32.780] an
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:33.020] action
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:33.620] potential,
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:34.540] then
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.260] you
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:36.480] see
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:36.680] that,
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:36.880] of
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:37.080] course,
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:37.260] in
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:37.400] the
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:37.780] oscilloscope.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:38.680] And
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:38.820] then
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:38.940] you
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.120] can
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:39.440] study
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:39.740] this
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:39.980] cell
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:40.120] in
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:40.340] all
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:40.540] kinds
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:40.720] of
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.260] detail
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:41.480] as
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:41.620] to
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:41.780] how
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:41.920] it
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.520] responds,
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:43.000] what
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:43.140] it
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:43.620] responds,
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:43.780] and
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:44.040] so
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:44.240] on
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:44.760] to
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.220] determine
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:45.900] what
[01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:46.140] its
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:46.680] characteristics
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.140] are.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:47.680] So
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.080] then,
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:48.540] when
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:48.720] they
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.000] did
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:49.340] that,
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:49.980] they
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:50.180] made
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:50.340] the
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:50.700] following
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:51.140] central
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:51.720] discoveries.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:52.240] They
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:52.700] discovered,
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.080] first
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:53.260] of
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:53.500] all,
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:54.100] that
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:54.880] receptors
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:55.700] all
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.140] hyperpolarize
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:57.340] to
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:57.620] light.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:58.440] Now
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:58.600] this
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:58.740] is
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:58.920] the
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.360] opposite
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:14:59.660] of
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:14:59.840] what
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:14:59.960] you
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.080] would
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:00.220] have
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:00.540] thought,
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:03.860] because
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:04.320] the
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:04.820] principle
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:05.600] of
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:05.760] the
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.140] way
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:06.920] cells
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.300] operate,
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:07.480] and
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:07.620] I'm
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:07.780] sure
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:07.940] you
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:08.060] know
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:08.240] all
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:08.400] this,
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:08.620] but
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:08.760] I
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:08.940] will
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:09.180] also
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:09.540] describe
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:09.820] it
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:09.920] in
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.040] a
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:10.160] bit
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:10.360] more
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:10.720] detail
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:10.880] in
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:11.000] a
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:11.220] minute.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:13.600] Cells,
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:13.880] when
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.200] they
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.740] hyperpolarize,
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.360] they
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:18.660] are
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:18.960] less
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:19.460] likely
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:20.320] to
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.360] cause
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:21.520] a
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:21.980] release
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:22.780] in
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:23.880] neurotransmitters.
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:24.360] If
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:24.540] they
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.680] depolarize,
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:26.540] they
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:27.000] will
[01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:28.370] increase
[01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:28.570] the
[01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:28.910] likelihood
[01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:29.750] of
[01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:33.350] neurotransmitters
[01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.610] being
[01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:34.090] released.
[01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.530] And
[01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:34.710] by
[01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:34.830] the
[01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.970] way,
[01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:35.130] the
[01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:35.950] neurotransmitter
[01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:36.530] for
[01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:36.970] these
[01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:38.110] receptors
[01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.390] is
[01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.950] glutamate.
[01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:40.110] And
[01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:41.970] also,
[01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:44.150] which
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:44.320] I
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:44.500] should
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:44.900] emphasize
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:45.500] here,
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:46.020] is
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:46.180] that
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:46.340] the
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:46.880] receptors
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.680] never
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.260] give
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:48.760] action
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:49.440] potentials.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:49.540] They
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:49.740] only
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.180] give
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:51.040] graded
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:51.860] potentials.
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:52.440] That's
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:52.700] also
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:52.940] true
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:53.060] for
[01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:53.200] the
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:53.560] horizontal
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.020] cells
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:54.420] and
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:54.600] the
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:54.960] bipolar
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.360] cells.
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:56.240] Now
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:56.440] they
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:56.780] found
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:56.980] that
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:57.420] all
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.300] receptors
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.340] hyperpolarize
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:00.500] to
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:00.760] light,
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:01.440] meaning
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.300] that
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:02.640] they
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.500] activate
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:03.940] subsequent
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:04.520] elements
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:04.660] in
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:04.800] the
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.140] retina
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:05.960] when
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:06.100] it
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:06.320] gets
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:06.920] darker
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:07.280] out
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:07.540] there,
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:07.800] rather
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.060] than
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:08.200] when
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:08.260] it
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:08.480] gets
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:08.860] lighter,
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:09.420] which
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:09.520] is
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:09.660] the
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:10.020] opposite
[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:10.380] that
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:10.740] we
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:10.900] all
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.040] would
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:11.160] have
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:11.640] expected.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:14.820] Same
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:15.020] thing
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:15.160] for
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:15.280] the
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:15.680] horizontal
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.080] cells.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:16.640] But
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:16.820] then
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:16.940] when
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:17.040] you
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:17.220] come
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:17.420] to
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:17.980] bipolar
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:18.540] cells,
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:19.340] suddenly
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:19.560] you
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.040] find
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:20.520] that
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:20.640] there
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:20.680] are
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:20.820] two
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:21.180] different
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:21.740] classes.
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:22.380] One
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:22.760] class
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.400] which
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.500] mimics
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.040] what
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:25.280] the
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:25.760] receptors
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:26.140] do.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:26.560] The
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:26.720] other
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:27.000] class
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:27.140] that
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:27.300] does
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:27.520] the
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:27.940] opposite.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.180] And
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:29.460] so
[01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:29.940] the
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:30.380] bipolar
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:30.800] cells
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:30.940] of
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:31.080] these
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:31.260] two
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:31.680] types,
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:32.040] this
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:32.640] type
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:33.500] has
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:33.900] a
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:34.100] sign
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:34.400] called
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:34.740] sign
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:35.500]-conserving
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.300] synapses.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.220] And
[01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:37.520] this
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:37.880] type
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.360] has
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:38.780] sign
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.540]-inverting
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:40.300] synapses.
[01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:43.750] Now,
[01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:44.230] amacrine
[01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:44.790] cells
[01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:45.470] come
[01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.750] in
[01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:46.750] various
[01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:47.310] types.
[01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.490] And
[01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:47.710] some
[01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:47.870] give
[01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:48.150] action
[01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:48.910] potentials.
[01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.290] And
[01:16:49.290 --> 01:16:49.750] ganglion
[01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:50.130] cells
[01:16:50.130 --> 01:16:50.470] all
[01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.790] give
[01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:51.130] action
[01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:51.750] potentials.
[01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.870] So
[01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:52.030] to
[01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.210] go
[01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:52.410] through
[01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:52.650] this
[01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:52.970] again,
[01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:54.010] all
[01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:54.470] receptors
[01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:55.450] hyperpolarize
[01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:55.590] to
[01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.770] light.
[01:16:56.010 --> 01:16:56.630] Horizontal
[01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:57.010] cells
[01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:57.550] all
[01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:59.070] hyperpolarize
[01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.230] to
[01:16:59.230 --> 01:16:59.450] light.
[01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.730] About
[01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:01.170] half
[01:17:01.170 --> 01:17:02.850] bipolar
[01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:03.210] cells
[01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:03.910] hyperpolarize
[01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:04.030] and
[01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:04.290] half
[01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:05.250] depolarize.
[01:17:05.610 --> 01:17:06.050] Now,
[01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.230] this
[01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:06.390] is
[01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.970] accomplished
[01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:07.250] by
[01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.410] the
[01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:07.630] way,
[01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:07.850] I'll
[01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:07.990] go
[01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.170] into
[01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:08.410] that
[01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:08.550] in
[01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.730] more
[01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:09.050] detail
[01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.490] later,
[01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:10.210] by
[01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:10.570] virtue
[01:17:10.570 --> 01:17:10.790] of
[01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:11.150] having
[01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:12.630] different
[01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:13.530] kinds
[01:17:13.530 --> 01:17:15.350] of
[01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:16.590] neurotransmitter
[01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:17.330] receptor
[01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:17.870] sites.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:19.880] And
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.040] I'll
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:20.260] talk
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:20.480] about
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:20.580] it
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:20.680] in
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:20.840] a
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.000] lot
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:21.120] of
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:21.440] detail
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:21.700] when
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:21.820] you
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.100] talk
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:22.360] about
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:22.520] the
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:22.640] on
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:22.740] and
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:22.900] off
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:23.240] cells.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:24.520] And
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:24.680] then
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:24.800] we
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:24.880] have
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:25.000] the
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:25.380] amacrine
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:25.700] cells.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:25.920] Some
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:26.580] hyperpolarize,
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:26.740] some
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:27.200] depolarize,
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:27.320] and
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:27.480] some
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:27.660] give
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:27.880] action
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.780] potentials.
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.000] And
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:29.540] all
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:30.340] ganglion
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:30.880] cells
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.360] give
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:31.680] action
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.400] potentials.
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:32.660] So
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:32.840] that
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:32.980] is
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:33.160] a
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:33.800] major,
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:34.120] major
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:34.720] discovery.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:35.600] And
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:35.820] not
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:36.020] only
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:36.380] major,
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:36.740] but
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.160] totally
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:37.780] unexpected
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:38.500] from
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:38.760] what
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.540] one
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:39.720] would
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:39.900] have
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:40.200] thought.
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:41.520] So
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:41.900] now,
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:42.540] let
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:42.660] me
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:42.960] just
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.680] explain
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:43.920] this
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.080] in
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:44.140] a
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:44.260] bit
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:44.480] more
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:44.940] detail.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:46.600] If
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:46.740] you
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:46.920] go
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:47.360] inside
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:47.580] a
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:47.960] cell,
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:49.580] then
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:49.860] if
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:51.100] this
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:51.460] cell
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:51.640] is
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.340] activated,
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:52.900] it
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:53.140] can
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:53.320] be
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:53.840] either
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.680] get
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.640] what
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:56.920] you
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:57.160] see
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:57.380] as
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:57.560] an
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.200] excitatory
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:58.920] postsynaptic
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:17:59.280] potential,
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:17:59.740] which
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:17:59.980] goes
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:00.180] from
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:00.480] minus
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:00.920] towards
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:01.300] plus.
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:02.180] Or
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:02.360] you
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:02.520] can
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:02.840] get
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.280] an
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.200] IPSP,
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:04.420] an

[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:05.820] postsynaptic
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:06.300] potential.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:07.240] And
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:07.460] this
[01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:07.980] discovery
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:08.280] was
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:08.520] made
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:08.840] by
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:09.300] Eccles,
[01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:10.380] which
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:10.520] was
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:10.640] a
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.040] remarkable
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:11.600] discovery
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:11.820] for
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:12.100] which
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:12.300] he
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:12.720] received
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:12.860] the
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:13.080] Nobel
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:13.640] Prize
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.360] some
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:15.680] years
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.040] back.
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:17.380] All
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:17.540] right,
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:17.720] so
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:18.160] now
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:18.740] if
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:18.960] we
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.560] look
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:19.720] at
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:20.020] those
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:20.380] cells
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:20.620] which
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.280] give
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:21.600] action
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.380] potentials,
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:22.720] what
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:23.080] happens
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:23.280] is
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:23.460] when
[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:23.580] you
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:23.720] get
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:23.860] an
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:24.540] EPSP,
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:24.840] that's
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:24.920] why
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.060] it's
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:25.180] called
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:25.880] excitatory
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:26.620] postsynaptic
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:27.080] potential,
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:28.440] then
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:28.620] you
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:28.940] increase
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:29.100] the
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:29.460] likelihood
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:29.720] that
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:30.480] an
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.240] action
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:31.780] potential
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:31.940] is
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:32.120] going
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:32.160] to
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:32.300] be
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:32.840] generated
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:33.400] that
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:33.560] will
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:33.960] send
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.580] its
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:34.960] signal
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:35.700] down
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:36.160] the
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:36.660] axon
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.260] to
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:37.760] the
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.160] next
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.700] location
[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:40.520] of
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:40.720] the
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.140] cells.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:42.120] All
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:42.260] right,
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:42.420] so
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:42.700] that's
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:42.840] the
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:43.180] basic
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:43.920] process.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.120] So
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:45.480] again,
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:45.720] to
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.060] reiterate,
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:46.940] photoreceptors
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:47.820] hyperpolarize
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:47.980] the
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:48.240] light.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:49.460] Therefore,
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.060] glutamate
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:50.260] is
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:50.660] released
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:51.180] when
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:51.400] there
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:51.540] is
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:51.800] a
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.440] decrease
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:52.980] in
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:53.780] illumination.
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:54.380] The
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:54.900] opposite
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:55.200] of
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:55.420] what
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:56.080] anyone
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:56.320] would
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:56.460] have
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:56.960] expected.
[01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.410] All
[01:18:58.410 --> 01:18:58.590] right,
[01:18:58.650 --> 01:18:58.770] so
[01:18:58.770 --> 01:18:59.030] that,
[01:18:59.130 --> 01:18:59.210] I
[01:18:59.210 --> 01:18:59.590] think,
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.180] brings
[01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:02.490] us
[01:19:02.490 --> 01:19:02.830] to
[01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.990] what
[01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.130] I
[01:19:03.130 --> 01:19:03.310] wanted
[01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:03.510] to
[01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.730] cover
[01:19:03.730 --> 01:19:04.170] today.
[01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.590] I'll
[01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:05.010] wait
[01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:05.250] until
[01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:05.610] next
[01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:05.870] time
[01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:06.030] to
[01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.310] talk
[01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.650] about
[01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:07.110] the
[01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.350] lateral
[01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.790] geniculate
[01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:08.170] nucleus,
[01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.410] which
[01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:08.570] is
[01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:08.770] very
[01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:09.150] brief.
[01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.610] But
[01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:09.870] let
[01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:10.010] me
[01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.230] go
[01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:10.490] through
[01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.710] the
[01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:11.390] photoreceptor
[01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.710] basics
[01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:12.130] again.
[01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:13.030] All
[01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:14.410] photoreceptors
[01:19:14.410 --> 01:19:15.290] hyperpolarize
[01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:15.470] the
[01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.750] light.
[01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:17.270] Depolarization
[01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.470] of
[01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.570] the
[01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:18.250] photoreceptor
[01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:19.050] releases
[01:19:19.050 --> 01:19:19.810] glutamate.
[01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:21.250] Photon
[01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:21.730] absorption
[01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:22.070] by
[01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.290] the
[01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:22.950] photopigment
[01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:23.490] results
[01:19:23.490 --> 01:19:24.650] in
[01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:25.410] isomerization
[01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:25.870] of
[01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:26.030] the
[01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.710] chromophore
[01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:27.210] from
[01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:27.570] 11
[01:19:27.570 --> 01:19:27.830] cis
[01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.990] to
[01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.250] 11
[01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:28.690] trans.
[01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:29.210] This
[01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:29.510] is
[01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:30.150] what
[01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:30.310] I
[01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.530] told
[01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.650] you
[01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:30.830] to
[01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:31.090] think
[01:19:31.090 --> 01:19:31.410] about
[01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:31.830] in
[01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.950] a
[01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:32.130] very
[01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:32.490] simple
[01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:32.970] fashion
[01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.630] to
[01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:33.970] say
[01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:36.590] that
[01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:37.210] the
[01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:39.230] photoreceptor
[01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:40.050] molecules,
[01:19:40.570 --> 01:19:41.110] rhodopsin
[01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.270] in
[01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.490] this
[01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:41.770] case,
[01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:43.050] either
[01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:43.270] is
[01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.650] bleached
[01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:43.970] or
[01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:44.690] unbleached.
[01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:46.090] So
[01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:46.350] once
[01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:46.550] it's
[01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.870] bleached,
[01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.170] further
[01:19:47.170 --> 01:19:47.490] light
[01:19:47.490 --> 01:19:47.690] has
[01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:47.870] no
[01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:48.190] effect
[01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:48.410] on
[01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:48.590] it.
[01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:49.310] And
[01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.670] at
[01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:49.850] any
[01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:50.470] point,
[01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:51.250] given
[01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:51.630] whatever
[01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:51.810] the
[01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:52.010] level
[01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:52.150] of
[01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:52.530] illumination
[01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:52.850] is,
[01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:53.210] a
[01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:53.430] certain
[01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.910] percentage
[01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:54.570] of
[01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:55.230] these
[01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:55.690] rhodopsin
[01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:56.190] molecules
[01:19:56.190 --> 01:19:56.750] are
[01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:57.030] bleached,
[01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:57.210] and
[01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:57.310] a
[01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.510] certain
[01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.950] percentage
[01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:58.330] is
[01:19:58.330 --> 01:19:58.870] unbleached.
[01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.390] The
[01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.730] darker
[01:19:59.730 --> 01:19:59.910] it
[01:19:59.910 --> 01:20:00.150] is,
[01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:00.510] the
[01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.870] more
[01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:01.570] are
[01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:02.190] unbleached.
[01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:03.310] All
[01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:03.550] right,
[01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:04.370] then
[01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:04.910] we
[01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:05.190] have
[01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:05.390] these
[01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.570] two
[01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.970] classes
[01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:06.210] that
[01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:06.310] we
[01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.590] talked
[01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.890] about,
[01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:07.090] the
[01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:07.290] on
[01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:07.430] and
[01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.570] the
[01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:07.790] off
[01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:08.090] cells,
[01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:08.270] that
[01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.390] we
[01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.510] will
[01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.830] discuss
[01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:09.070] in
[01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:09.250] some
[01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:09.730] detail.
[01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:11.310] The
[01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:11.890] synaptic
[01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:12.250] junction
[01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:12.490] of
[01:20:12.490 --> 01:20:13.010] bipolars
[01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.210] is
[01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:13.390] sign
[01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:13.930]-conserving,
[01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:14.170] as
[01:20:14.170 --> 01:20:14.330] I
[01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.470] had
[01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.650] just
[01:20:14.650 --> 01:20:14.930] said.
[01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:15.370] And
[01:20:15.370 --> 01:20:15.570] that
[01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:15.730] of
[01:20:15.730 --> 01:20:15.870] the
[01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:16.590] unbipolars
[01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.830] is
[01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:17.210] sign
[01:20:17.210 --> 01:20:17.930]-inverting.
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:18.960] Now,
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:19.180] the
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:19.960] unbipolar
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:20.500] receptor
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.400] is,
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:21.540] I
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:21.760] should
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.120] mention
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:22.340] that
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:22.700] now,
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:22.940] and
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:23.100] I
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:23.240] will
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:23.460] deal
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:23.960] with
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:24.080] it
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:24.260] in
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:24.680] detail,
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:25.880] is
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:26.180] called
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:26.400] the
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:26.740] mGluR6.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.260] Its
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:29.800] activation
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.200] leads
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:30.380] to
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:30.820] closing
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:31.040] of
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:31.460] channels
[01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:32.220] causing
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.300] hyperpolarization.
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:34.220] So
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:34.500] that's
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:34.640] the
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.020] basic
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:35.560] layout,
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:35.820] then,
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:36.320] of
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:36.460] the
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:37.500] photoreceptors.
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:38.380] And
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.880] I
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:40.080] will
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:40.340] now
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:40.780] stop
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:41.020] at
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:41.240] this
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:41.640] point.
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:42.280] And
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:42.560] next
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:42.800] time,
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:42.960] we'll
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.200] talk
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:43.360] a
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:43.500] little
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:43.840] bit
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:44.400] about
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.540] the
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.540] lateral
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:46.920] geniculate
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:47.380] nucleus.
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:47.840] And
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:48.020] then
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:48.180] we're
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:48.240] going
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:48.340] to
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:48.540] move
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:48.740] on
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:48.880] to
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:49.100] talk
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:49.360] about
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:49.580] the
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:49.960] cortex.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:50.740] And
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:50.920] then
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:51.080] if
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:51.200] you
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:51.400] look
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:51.600] at
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:51.880] your
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.540] assignment
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:54.020] sheet,
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:54.460] as
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:54.580] you
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:54.720] can
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.040] see
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:55.420] here,
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:55.860] that
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:56.040] on
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:56.620] September
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:57.280] 16,
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:58.260] we're
[01:20:58.260 --> 01:20:58.280] going
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:58.340] to
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:20:58.560] talk
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:58.820] about
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:20:59.000] the
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:20:59.260] on
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:20:59.380] and
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:20:59.600] off
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.100] channels.
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:00.580] And
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:00.760] then
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:00.980] we'll
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:01.180] deal
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:01.340] in
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:01.580] more
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:02.140] detail
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:02.700] with
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:02.900] these
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:03.140] really
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:03.420] rather
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:03.980] complex
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:04.320] things,
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:04.780] which
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:04.920] are
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:05.120] pretty
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:05.360] hard
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:05.500] to
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:05.960] remember
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:06.960] about
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.940] hyperpolarization,
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:08.780] depolarization,
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:09.540] glutamate,
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:11.140] glutamate
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:12.100] receptor
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:12.520] sites,
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:12.680] and
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:12.880] so
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.080] on.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:13.560] OK?
[01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:15.350] Thank
[01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.490] you.
