[00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.670] cars
[00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.790] are
[00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.950] pretty
[00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.230] cool,

[00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.070] hot
[00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.350] nowadays.
[00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.030] So
[00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.570] we're
[00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.670] going

[00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.830] use

[00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.490] And
[00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.670] in
[00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.790] the

[00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.530] how
[00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.070] we
[00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.250] can
[00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.750] give
[00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.410] an

[00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.910] a

[00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.050] we
[00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.170] want

[00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.370] to

[00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.630] For
[00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.950] example,
[00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.170] we
[00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.310] might
[00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.450] have
[00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.530] a
[00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.690] car
[00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.850] that
[00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.010] wants
[00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.110] to
[00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.250] pick
[00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.350] up
[00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.510] some
[00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.890] passengers
[00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.190] along
[00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.290] the

[00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.930] get

[00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.550] and
[00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.070] maybe
[00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.430] navigate
[00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.690] some
[00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.970] world.
[00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.530] But
[00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.030] let's
[00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.390] consider
[00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.950] that
[00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.570] for
[00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.750] something
[00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.910] like
[00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.010] a

[00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.170] we
[00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.330] also
[00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.630] have
[00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.130] a

[00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.490] of

[00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.530] requirements
[00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.030] that
[00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.150] are
[00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.770] implicit
[00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.110] along
[00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.230] the

[00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.710] in
[00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.930] that
[00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.730] we
[00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.950] want
[00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.110] our
[00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.430] self
[00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.630]-driving
[00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.950] car
[00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.410] to
[00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.950] obey
[00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.250] the
[00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.470] rules
[00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.570] of
[00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.690] the
[00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.910] road
[00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.290] as
[00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.450] it's
[00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.710] driving.
[00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.510] And
[00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.670] these
[00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.850] aren't
[00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.270] just
[00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.410] goal
[00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.850] conditions,
[00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.210] which
[00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.350] is
[00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.590] a
[00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.970] single
[00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.230] goal
[00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.350] that
[00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.470] you're
[00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.610] trying
[00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.710] to
[00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.950] reach,
[00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.130] but
[00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.290] these
[00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.410] are
[00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.810] goals
[00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.950] that
[00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.050] you're
[00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.190] trying
[00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.350] to
[00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.830] maintain
[00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.210] throughout
[00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.410] the

[00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.770] that
[00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.910] you're
[00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.170] traveling.
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.420] So
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.780] one
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.140] example
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.340] of
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.620] this
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.140] is
[00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.350] a
[00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.770] traffic
[00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.030] light.
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.460] So
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.740] maybe
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.880] you
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.000] guys
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.120] can
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.240] help
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.360] me
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.460] out
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.600] with
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.960] this.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.040] Just
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.220] in
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.420] plain
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.820] English,
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.560] how
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.720] would
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.880] you
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.620] describe
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.120] the
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.440] rules
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.640] of
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.780] how
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.880] you
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.980] would
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.100] want
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.200] a
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.360] car
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.500] to
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.860] behave
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.700] when
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.960] it
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.180] goes
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.540] across
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.760] a
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.020] traffic
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.260] light?
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.240] Very
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.560] simple.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.460] Slow
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.800] down
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.940] if
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.100] you
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.280] see
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.760] yellow,
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.320] stop
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.640] if
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.780] you
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.940] see
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.360] red,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.920] go.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.340] Yep.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.040] Yeah.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.660] So
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.420] pretty
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.700] much
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.440] stop
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.600] if
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.680] you
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.800] see
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.100] red,
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.400] go
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.520] if
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.620] you

[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.000] And
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.940] specifically,
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.420] if
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.520] you
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.660] see
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.920] red
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.020] and
[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.140] you
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.540] stop,
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.080] you're
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.120] going
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.180] to
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.300] want
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.400] to
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.720] stop
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.240] until
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.540] you
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.660] see
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.800] the
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.040] green,
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.240] at
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.420] which
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.700] point
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.280] that
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.220] condition
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.480] that
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.620] you're
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.000] stopping
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.940] goes
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.280] away
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.520] and
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.740] you're
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.880] able
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.080] to
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.500] move
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.720] on.
[00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.070] And
[00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.230] then
[00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.570] in
[00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.810] addition
[00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.250] to
[00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.570] things
[00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.810] like

[00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.570] traffic
[00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.930] lights,
[00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.710] there
[00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.850] might
[00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.030] also
[00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.210] be
[00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.350] some

[00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.070] that
[00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.190] we
[00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.330] want
[00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.430] to
[00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.690] follow.
[00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.990] For
[00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.270] example,
[00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.690] we
[00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.810] might
[00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.950] want
[00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.070] to
[00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.510] always
[00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.910] stay
[00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.450] within

[00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.270] limit.
[00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.230] And
[00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.350] then
[00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.470] there
[00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.590] might
[00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.790] also
[00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.930] be
[00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.090] some

[00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.130] conditions
[00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.710] of

[00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:16.130] on
[00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.250] the
[00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.490] road,
[00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.030] which
[00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.210] is
[00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.470] that
[00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.670] at
[00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.810] some
[00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.970] point
[00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.110] we're
[00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.190] going
[00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.270] to
[00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.370] need
[00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.490] to
[00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.870] refuel.
[00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.470] And
[00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.570] if
[00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.670] we
[00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.950] consider
[00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.370] a
[00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.550] car
[00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.690] that
[00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.810] might
[00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.910] be
[00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.130] driving
[00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.310] for
[00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.430] a

[00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.230] time,
[00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.610] one

[00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.550] statement
[00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.750] we
[00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.890] could
[00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.250] say
[00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.730] about
[00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.490] the
[00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.030] path
[00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.170] that
[00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.330] this
[00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.510] car
[00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.850] takes
[00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.990] and
[00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.430] the
[00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.870] sequence
[00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.030] of
[00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.310] states
[00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.450] that
[00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.530] it
[00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.710] goes
[00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.990] through
[00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.490] is
[00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.730] that
[00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.310] at
[00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.510] every
[00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.730] point
[00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.890] in
[00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.170] time,
[00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.970] we
[00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.170] want
[00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.330] the
[00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.670] plan
[00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.950] to
[00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.350] have
[00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.190] some

[00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.850] state
[00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.110] when
[00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.270] we
[00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.430] are
[00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.670] going
[00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.830] to
[00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.130] visit
[00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.330] a
[00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.530] gas
[00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.790] station.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.960] So
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.200] this
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.400] isn't
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.520] just
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.680] a
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.980] single
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.240] goal
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.380] that
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.460] we're
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.660] trying
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.760] to
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.940] reach.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.120] But
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.400] over
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.960] a
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.120] very

[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.600] time,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.860] even
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.120] if
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.240] we
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.600] consider
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.780] that
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.940] this
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.120] car
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.220] could
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.440] drive
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.560] an
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.800] infinite
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.040] amount
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.160] of
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.440] time,
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.500] at
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.940] every
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.180] point
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.320] in
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.560] time,
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.340] we're
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.500] going
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.580] to
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.680] need
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.800] to
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.940] be
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.160] thinking
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.500] ahead
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.040] that
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.400] there's
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.520] going
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.580] to
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.680] be
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.940] some
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.260] time
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.560] when
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.760] we
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.180] reach
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.720] a

[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.300] station
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.480] and
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.740] refuel.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.660] So
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.940] these
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.240] types
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.400] of
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.820] conditions,
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.540] things
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.840] like
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.560] staying
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.680] at
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.760] a

[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.340] until
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.520] it
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.720] turns
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.080] green,
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.100] always
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.540] staying
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.780] within
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.920] a

[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.640] limit,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.280] or
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.900] always
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.180] having
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.440] some

[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.060] in
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.180] the
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.480] future,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.800] some
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.020] state
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.160] in
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.260] the
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.480] future
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.720] when
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.880] we
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.080] reach
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.180] a
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.380] gas
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.720] station,
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.220] are
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.420] things
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.520] that
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.580] we
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.700] can
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.160] express
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.520] with
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.640] a
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.800] type
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.940] of
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.160] logic
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.420] called
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.740] temporal
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.120] logic.
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.220] And
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.400] there
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.480] are
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.600] two
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.840] things
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.060] that
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.260] we
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.480] hope
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.680] you're
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.760] going
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.820] to
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.920] be
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.060] able
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.160] to
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.340] do
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.500] by
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.600] the
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.740] time
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.880] you
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.040] leave
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.200] this
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.480] lecture.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.400] The
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.700] first
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.880] is
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.940] to
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.000] be
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.100] able
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.340] to
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.200] model
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.800] these
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.300] temporally
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.720] extended
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.180] goals
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.100] using
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.520] a
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.840] specific
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.120] type
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.240] of
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.500] temporal
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.820] logic
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.100] called
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.420] linear
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.800] temporal
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.240] logic,
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.500] or
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.080] LTL.
[00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.490] And
[00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.930] secondly,
[00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.670] we're
[00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.750] going
[00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.830] to
[00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.990] hope
[00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.110] that
[00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.230] you'll
[00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.330] be
[00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.490] able
[00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.970] to
[00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.410] actually
[00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.710] apply
[00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.870] this
[00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.010] to
[00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.350] planning,
[00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.050] create
[00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.410] plans
[00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.630] with
[00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.810] these
[00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.150] temporally
[00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.470] extended
[00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.910] goals,
[00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.790] and
[00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.330] in
[00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.610] addition
[00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.170] to
[00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.610] just
[00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.170] the
[00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.750] regular
[00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.050] planning
[00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.230] we've
[00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.330] been
[00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.550] dealing
[00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.770] with,
[00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.270] actually
[00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.150] incorporating
[00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.410] this
[00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.610] idea
[00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.770] of
[00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.170] preferences
[00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.190] into
[00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.370] your
[00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.710] plans.
[00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.450] So
[00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.650] a
[00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.850] preference
[00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.230] basically
[00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.950] is
[00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.570] not
[00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.750] a
[00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.610] required
[00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.090] condition,
[00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.830] but
[00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.090] a
[00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.490] desired
[00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.970] condition
[00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.050] that
[00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.710] you
[00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.850] can
[00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.090] use
[00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.270] to
[00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.690] select
[00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.690] between
[00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.550] alternative
[00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.970] paths.
[00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.970] So
[00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:03.770] you
[00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.930] might
[00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.090] have
[00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.310] many
[00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.570] different
[00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.850] ways
[00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.990] that
[00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.070] you
[00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.210] could
[00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.390] reach
[00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.510] your
[00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.730] goal,
[00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.410] but
[00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.810] we
[00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.950] can
[00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:07.210] use
[00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.370] some
[00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.510] of
[00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.730] these
[00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.150] temporally
[00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.510] extended
[00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.930] goals,
[00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.290] like
[00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.050] maybe
[00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.290] you
[00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.610] prefer
[00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.830] to
[00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.050] break
[00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.250] as
[00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.570] few
[00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.350] of
[00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.490] the
[00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.690] rules
[00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.810] of
[00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.910] the
[00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.090] road
[00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.250] as
[00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.370] you
[00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.670] can,
[00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.950] and
[00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.210] you
[00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.350] can
[00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.530] use
[00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.930] those
[00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.710] as
[00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:17.110] preferences
[00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.710] to
[00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.370] choose
[00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.650] between
[00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.950] plans.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.800] So
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.940] just
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.120] as
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.220] an
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.520] outline,
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.100] first
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.220] we're
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.340] just
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.440] going
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.480] to
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.600] do
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.700] a
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.780] little
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.300] introduction
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.700] to
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.000] linear
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.320] temporal
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.680] logic.
[00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.830] We're
[00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.910] going
[00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.950] to
[00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.130] talk
[00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.330] about
[00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.630] what
[00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.190] this
[00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.410] is,
[00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.630] what
[00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.110] LTL
[00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.370] is,
[00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.830] why
[00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.970] you
[00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:30.090] want
[00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.170] to
[00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.370] use
[00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.610] it,
[00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.310] and
[00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.450] we're
[00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.530] going
[00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.610] to
[00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.890] go
[00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.090] through
[00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.290] the
[00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.690] syntax
[00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.850] and
[00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.950] the
[00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.350] semantics
[00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.950] of
[00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.350] different
[00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.730] LTL
[00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.170] operators.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.600] Then
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.740] we're
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.800] going
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.840] to
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.040] walk
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.160] you
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.280] through
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.500] some
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.960] example
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.420] LTL
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.920] problems,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.440] and
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.620] actually
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.860] talk
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.120] about
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.280] its
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.040] applications
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.260] to
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.540] planning,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.860] how
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.960] you
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.180] create
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.560] plans
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.960] with
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.480] these
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.780] linear
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.320] temporal
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.960] logic,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.860] temporal
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.220] goals.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.720] Finally,
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.980] we're
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.080] going
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.280] to
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.680] incorporate
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.120] preferences
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.380] into
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.660] this,
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.960] talk
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.100] about
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.260] how
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.340] you
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.660] express
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.060] preferences,
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.880] and
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.260] specifically
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.540] talk
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.680] about
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.780] a
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.020] language
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.260] called
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.660] LPP
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.000] that
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.240] allows
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.320] you
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.420] to
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.740] plan
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.680] with
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.920] temporal
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.240] logic
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.400] and
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.740] preferences.
[00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.030] So
[00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.330] now
[00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.490] for
[00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.710] the
[00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.670] introduction
[00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.370] to
[00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.790] linear
[00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.070] temporal
[00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.450] logic.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.640] Temporal
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.900] logic,
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.120] at
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.280] its
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.600] core,
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.880] is
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.020] a
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.600] formalism
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.860] for
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.320] specifying
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.740] properties
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.900] of
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.020] a
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.320] system
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.540] that
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.740] vary
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.900] with
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.200] time.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.920] So
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.100] these
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.300] aren't
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.560] just
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.360] conditions
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.480] that
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.780] are
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.020] true
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.200] at
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.300] a
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.500] single
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.840] state,
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.300] which
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.400] is
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.500] what
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.660] we've
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.860] mostly
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.040] been
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.260] dealing
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.560] with
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.920] with
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.480] prepositional
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.860] logic.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.740] So
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.900] we've
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.120] been
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.600] saying
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.900] things
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.240] like
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.200] condition
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.520] A
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.940] and
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.360] B
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.460] but
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.680] not
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.980] C
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.280] are
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.480] true
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.620] at
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.700] a
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.860] given
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.220] state,
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.860] and
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.100] that's
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.620] prepositional
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.000] logic.
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.720] Temporal
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.940] logic
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.100] is
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.240] sort
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.300] of
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.420] a
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.580] layer
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.740] on
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.900] top
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.020] of
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.220] that
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.460] when
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.600] we're
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.740] dealing
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.940] not
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.080] just
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.280] with
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.680] what's
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.840] true
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.960] at
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.040] a
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.240] single
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.560] state,
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.820] but
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.020] actually
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.420] extending
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.620] that
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.840] over
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.220] time
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.980] as
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.080] the
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.340] system
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.560] moves
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.700] through
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.820] a
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.080] sequence
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.280] of
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.580] states.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.780] Expressing
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.220] properties
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.500] on
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.660] a
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.940] temporal
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.280] level.
[00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.190] So
[00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.630] you
[00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.870] might
[00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.010] have
[00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.130] a
[00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.570] system
[00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.870] that
[00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.990] can
[00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.050] be
[00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.430] represented
[00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.850] as
[00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.970] a
[00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:46.150] state
[00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.670] machine,
[00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.690] an
[00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.090] automata,
[00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.470] and
[00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.030] it
[00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.690] can
[00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.910] go
[00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.190] through
[00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.490] a
[00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.730] sequence
[00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.410] of
[00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.870] different
[00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.370] states.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.320] And
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.900] while
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.980] you
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.120] might
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.220] be
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.300] able
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.380] to
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.660] represent
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.840] the
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.980] whole
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.260] system
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.460] like
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.760] this,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.160] if
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.260] we
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.440] actually
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.900] execute
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.120] the
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.520] system,
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.080] we're
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.180] going
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.240] to
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.460] get
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.060] one
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.740] path
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.040] to
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.220] remove
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.380] the
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.680] system.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.380] That's
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.660] often
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.820] called
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.960] a
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.320] trace
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.680] of
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.800] the
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.160] system.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.600] You
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.700] can
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.840] also
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.020] think
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.080] of
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.160] it
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.280] as
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.400] a
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.720] timeline
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.920] of
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.040] the
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.340] system.
[00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.080] So
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.740] one
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.060] example
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.540] timeline
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.740] of
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.860] the
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.260] system
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.720] is
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.240] it
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.400] might
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.620] start
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.740] at
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.900] state
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.280] A,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.620] then
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.740] go
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.840] to
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.000] state
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.380] C,
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.440] and
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.540] then
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.660] go
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:15.780] to
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.000] D,
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.280] and
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.460] keep
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.700] moving
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.920] around
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.040] to
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.180] D
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.500] forever.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.280] So
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.480] that's
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.640] one
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.080] trace
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.220] or
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.380] one
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.720] timeline
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.940] of
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.040] the
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.340] system,
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.800] and
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.960] that's
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.100] really
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.240] just
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.380] a
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.720] sequence
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.080] of
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.460] states
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.640] that
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.740] it
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.920] goes
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.140] through.
[00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.170] And
[00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.310] in
[00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.410] the
[00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.650] past,
[00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.810] we've
[00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.950] seen
[00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.250] this
[00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.530] in
[00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.690] some
[00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.750] of
[00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.850] the
[00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.210] problem
[00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.530] sets.
[00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.770] For
[00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.190] example,
[00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.050] when
[00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.150] we
[00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.250] were
[00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.710] modeling
[00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.310] the
[00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.650] warp
[00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.210] reactor,
[00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.570] we've
[00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.690] had
[00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.810] the
[00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.210] valves
[00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.410] that
[00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.530] could
[00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.970] transition
[00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:36.230] between
[00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.810] open
[00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.950] and
[00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.130] closed
[00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.610] states.
[00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.850] It
[00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.890] could
[00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.050] also
[00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.330] be
[00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.910] the
[00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:40.150] whole
[00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.230] system
[00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.770] of
[00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.890] a
[00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.350] starship
[00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.630] going
[00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.850] through
[00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:43.210] different
[00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.670] planets,
[00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.770] transitioning
[00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:45.310] through
[00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.550] a
[00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.730] larger
[00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.390] set
[00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.490] of
[00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.930] locations,
[00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.350] picking
[00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.490] up
[00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.830] passengers,
[00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:49.150] dropping
[00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.310] them
[00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.470] off.
[00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.630] So
[00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.790] these
[00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.910] could
[00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.010] be
[00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.210] quite
[00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.710] complex.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.160] And
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.280] so
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.460] as
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.560] I
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.860] said,
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.640] previously
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.380] in
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.820] our
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.240] problems
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.380] that
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.540] we've
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.680] been
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:06:59.980] modeling,
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.000] we've
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.100] been
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.260] going
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.440] through
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.580] a
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.840] system,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.080] and
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.240] we've
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.380] been
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.600] searching
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.840] for
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.000] a
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.340] single
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.080] state
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.400] that
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.760] satisfies
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.020] all
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.120] of
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.220] our
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.380] goal
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.800] conditions.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.840] Maybe
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.220] we
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.340] want
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.420] to
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.580] reach
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.080] Lavinia
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.520] and
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.860] save
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.140] a
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.380] certain
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.600] number
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.740] of
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.940] people.
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:12.680] But
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.000] with
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.480] temporal
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.860] logic,
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.280] we
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.420] can
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.620] actually
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.000] express
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.440] goals
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.700] that
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.820] are
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.140] satisfied
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.520] over
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.680] a
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.860] number
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.080] of
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.400] states.
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.540] And
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.980] this
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.300] allows
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.480] us
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.620] to
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.020] do
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.460] some
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.100] more
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.280] expressive
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.040] goals
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.320] than
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.420] we
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.560] could
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.920] capture
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.160] just
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.340] by
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:26.580] looking
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.720] at
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.820] a
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.000] single
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.280] state
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.440] at
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:27.560] the
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.780] end.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.780] So
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.040] for
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.360] example,
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.200] what
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.420] if
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.720] a
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.000] problem
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.620] requires
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.280] some
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:37.640] condition
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.820] to
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:37.980] be
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.220] met
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.920] until
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.220] another
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:39.560] condition
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.740] is
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.080] met?
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.780] For
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.140] example,
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.000] when
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.140] you
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.260] see
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.380] a
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.540] red
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:42.800] light,
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.040] that
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.480] implies
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.720] that
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:43.820] we
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:43.980] should
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.440] stop
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:44.860] until
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.040] we
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.200] see
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.480] a
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.700] green
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:45.900] light.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.300] And
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:48.780] if
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:48.860] we
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.000] look
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.180] at
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.420] a
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:49.940] timeline
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.360] or
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.460] a
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:50.780] trace
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.100] of
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.360] one
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.440] of
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:51.580] these
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.040] systems,
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:52.920] that
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.080] might
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.280] look
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:53.600] something
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:53.780] like
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.020] this.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.340] So
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:54.560] we're
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:54.760] going
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.100] along
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.460] through
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:55.620] our
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:55.980] system,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.580] and
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:56.700] at
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:56.800] one
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:56.880] of
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.000] the
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.240] states,
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.420] we
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:57.740] see
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.020] the
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.180] red
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:58.480] light.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:59.340] So
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.580] that
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.000] adds
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.160] this
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.560] condition
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.460] that
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:01.540] we
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:01.680] should
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.100] stop.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.060] And
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.260] then
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:03.480] that
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:03.800] condition
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:03.960] will
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.140] hold
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.460] forever
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:04.940] until
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.180] we
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.300] see
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:05.420] a
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:05.580] green
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:05.860] light,
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.220] at
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:06.340] which
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:06.580] point
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:06.780] that
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.080] condition
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.260] is
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:07.560] dropped,
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.040] and
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.240] we
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.400] can
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:08.540] keep
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:09.500] going.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.000] Another
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.380] example
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:11.640] where
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:11.760] we
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:11.900] might
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.020] want
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.080] to
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.240] use
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:12.520] temporal
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:12.840] logic
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.600] is,
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:13.840] what
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:13.960] if
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.080] our
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.460] problem
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.040] requires
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.680] a
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.000] condition
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.440] to
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.400] always
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:17.900] eventually
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.120] be
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.360] met?
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:18.640] And
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:18.780] this
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:18.840] is
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:18.920] what
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:18.960] I
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.040] was
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.220] talking
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:19.380] about
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:19.480] with
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:19.560] the
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:19.780] gas
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.100] station.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:21.760] So
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.120] we
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.240] might
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.360] be
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:22.540] going
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:22.720] on
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.020] forever,
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:23.860] and
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.100] there
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.260] should
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:24.500] always
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:24.660] be
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:24.900] some
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.140] point
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:25.260] in
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:25.360] the
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.640] future
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.220] when
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:26.460] we
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:26.880] do
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.260] have
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.420] a
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:28.660] state
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:28.800] where
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:28.940] we're
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.060] at
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.140] a
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.340] gas
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:29.620] station.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.360] So
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:30.600] we
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:30.760] might
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:30.980] start
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.140] our
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:31.600] system
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.960] at
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.040] a
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.220] certain
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:33.580] state,
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:34.780] and
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.140] our
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:35.460] plan
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:35.780] says
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.200] that
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.940] at
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.120] some
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.280] point,
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:37.440] we
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:37.540] do
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:37.740] reach
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:37.820] a
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.020] gas
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.280] station.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:38.460] So
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:38.660] that's
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:38.860] good.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.300] But
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:39.420] then
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:39.540] when
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:39.620] we
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:39.720] get
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:39.840] to
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:39.960] the
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.140] next
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.380] state,
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:40.560] we
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:40.740] also
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:40.980] want
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.080] it
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.160] to
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:41.300] be
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:41.540] true
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:41.880] that
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.060] from
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:42.240] that
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.440] point
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:42.580] on,
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:42.760] we're
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:42.840] going
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:42.900] to
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.080] reach
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.280] another
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:43.560] gas
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:43.860] station.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.360] And
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.720] after
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.020] that,
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:46.520] going
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:46.760] on
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:46.860] and
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.020] on
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.140] and
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.340] on
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:47.660] into
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:47.760] the
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:47.880] future.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.080] These
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.180] are
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:50.380] things
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:50.480] that
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:50.580] you
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.820] can't
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.180] express
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:53.740] very
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.080] easily
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.380] with
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:54.520] the
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:54.820] types
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.220] of
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:55.500] logic
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:55.760] that
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:55.920] we've
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.020] been
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:56.200] dealing
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.380] with
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:56.700] before.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.000] So
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.320] one
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.700] important
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.220] distinction
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:01.580] that
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:01.660] we
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:01.780] should
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.020] clear
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.200] up
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.700] before
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.440] we
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:03.660] really
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:03.920] dive
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.140] into
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.420] the
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:04.800] syntax
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.020] of
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.340] how
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:05.860] these
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.160] linear
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.460] temporal
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:06.800] logics
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.160] work
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.500] is
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:08.620] the
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:08.840] difference
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.240] between
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.000] branching
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.280] time
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:10.620] and
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:10.860] linear
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.100] time.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:11.260] There
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:11.340] are
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:11.500] really
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:11.680] two
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:11.860] different
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.040] models
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.240] of
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:13.440] time
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:13.560] that
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:13.660] we
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:13.780] can
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.040] be
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.300] working
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:14.520] with.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.200] There's
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:15.340] two
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:15.540] different
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:15.800] types
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:15.940] of
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.160] temporal
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.520] logic
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:16.700] that
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.100] exist
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.840] to
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.160] express
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:18.360] these
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:18.600] different
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:18.860] types
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:19.000] of
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.240] time.
[00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.290] So
[00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:20.610] linear
[00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:20.970] time
[00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.750] is
[00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.830] more
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:23.380] similar
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:23.780] to
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.500] the
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:24.760] world
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:24.900] that
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.040] we
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.240] live
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.480] in.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.280] Unless

[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.260] where
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:28.540] time
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:28.680] is
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.020] branching
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:29.180] into
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:29.440] different
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:29.880] realities
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.900] and
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.060] all
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.220] sorts
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:31.360] of
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:31.600] crazy
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:31.820] stuff
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:31.940] is
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.120] going
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.340] on,
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:32.960] you
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.080] can
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.200] think
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.320] of
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:33.600] time
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:33.940] as
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.120] just
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.460] this
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.340] linear
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:35.740] timeline.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.080] So
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.340] right
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:36.620] now,
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.100] there's
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.280] one
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:37.540] future
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:37.840] state
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.020] that's
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.100] going
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.180] to
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:38.360] happen
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:38.540] for
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:38.760] me.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:40.920] And
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.420] regardless
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.040] of
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.160] how
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.320] many
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:42.640] options
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:42.800] I
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.060] have,
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.380] there's
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.180] one
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:44.740] realization
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.000] of
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.100] the
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.380] time.
[00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:47.550] And
[00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.890] what
[00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:48.070] this
[00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.150] lets
[00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.310] us
[00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.570] do
[00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:49.830] is
[00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:49.990] that
[00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.130] it
[00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:50.290] gives
[00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:50.550] us
[00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.990] a
[00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.210] single
[00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.570] path
[00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:51.750] for
[00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.890] our
[00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:52.210] system.
[00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:52.970] And
[00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:53.290] we
[00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:53.630] can
[00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.410] reason
[00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:55.730] very
[00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.210] exactly
[00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.930] about
[00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:57.830] the
[00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.430] conditions
[00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.450] that
[00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:00.550] are
[00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.830] met
[00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.370] within
[00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:01.590] that
[00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.330] path.
[00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.510] And
[00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:02.650] this
[00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:02.970] lets
[00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.250] us
[00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.550] describe
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.400] what
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:10.560] will
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.040] always
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.260] happen
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.420] in
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:11.440] a
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:11.660] system.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:11.880] For
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.080] example,
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:12.900] we
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.080] can
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.460] guarantee
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:13.960] that
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.460] we
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:14.920] always
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.540] stop
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:15.660] at
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:15.760] a
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:15.880] red
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.100] light
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.380] until
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.540] we
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:16.660] see
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:16.780] a
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:16.880] green
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.060] light,
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.180] or
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:17.340] we
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:17.660] always
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.000] stay
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.400] within
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.980] the
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:20.980] speed
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.220] limit.
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.240] This
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:23.400] is
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.020] contrasted
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.540] with
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:24.640] a
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:24.840] different
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.060] model
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.200] of
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:25.460] time
[00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:26.970] called
[00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.410] branching
[00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.670] time.
[00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:28.630] And
[00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.610] in
[00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:29.790] this
[00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.990] model
[00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.170] of
[00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.390] time,
[00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:31.150] at
[00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.350] each
[00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.570] time
[00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:31.870] instant,
[00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.270] we
[00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:32.630] consider
[00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.010] all
[00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:33.410] possible
[00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.810] futures.
[00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:34.770] So
[00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.050] if
[00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.230] we
[00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.670] have
[00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.610] multiple
[00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.090] actions
[00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:37.230] that
[00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.310] we
[00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.430] can
[00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.830] perform
[00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:38.110] at
[00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.210] a
[00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.390] given
[00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:38.750] state,
[00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.310] we're
[00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.390] going
[00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:39.470] to
[00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.750] consider
[00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.110] different
[00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.510] timelines
[00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:40.750] that
[00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.030] branch
[00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.270] off
[00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:41.410] from
[00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:41.570] each
[00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.650] of
[00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:41.990] those
[00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.470] possible
[00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:43.890] behaviors.
[00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.790] And
[00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.030] this
[00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.650] results
[00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.230] in
[00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.250] alternate
[00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:47.570] courses
[00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:47.770] of
[00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:48.070] time
[00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:48.850] that
[00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:48.970] we
[00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:49.110] can
[00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.350] reason
[00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.670] about
[00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.910] as
[00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:50.030] a
[00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.250] set.
[00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.990] And
[00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.410] instead
[00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.870] of
[00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.170] thinking
[00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:52.330] about
[00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:52.550] this
[00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.030] as
[00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.850] always
[00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:54.310] conditions,
[00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:54.690] so
[00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.330] our
[00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:55.690] path
[00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.050] always
[00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:56.250] does
[00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:56.450] this,
[00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.670] we
[00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.790] can
[00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.930] think
[00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:57.090] about
[00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.230] this
[00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.410] more
[00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.530] in
[00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.070] possibilities.
[00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.050] If
[00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.170] we're
[00:10:59.170 --> 00:10:59.390] using
[00:10:59.390 --> 00:10:59.770] branching
[00:10:59.770 --> 00:10:59.950] time,
[00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.110] we
[00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.230] can

[00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.210] exists
[00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:03.410] a

[00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.430] in
[00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.790] which
[00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.270] we
[00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:05.450] will
[00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:05.710] always
[00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.090] stay
[00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:06.490] under

[00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:07.990] Or
[00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.230] at
[00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.410] this

[00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.390] So
[00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.490] whereas
[00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:14.810] linear
[00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.110] temporal
[00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.430] logic
[00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.790] is

[00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.910] happen

[00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.730] time
[00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:22.410] allows
[00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:22.590] us
[00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.670] to
[00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.910] reason
[00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.230] about

[00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.830] might
[00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.210] possibly

[00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.190] So
[00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.350] for
[00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.550] our

[00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:30.110] part
[00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.370] because
[00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:30.510] it's

[00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:32.290] it
[00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:32.450] gives
[00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:32.590] us
[00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.710] an
[00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.070] exact

[00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:35.350] path,
[00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.110] we're
[00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.190] going

[00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.190] time.
[00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:37.650] And
[00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:37.750] for
[00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.930] that
[00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:38.130] reason,
[00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.270] we
[00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:38.530] use
[00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:38.810] what's
[00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:38.950] called
[00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:39.310] linear
[00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.650] temporal
[00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.050] logic.
[00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.850] There's
[00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.930] a
[00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:41.110] different

[00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.390] There's
[00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:43.630] one
[00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:43.790] called
[00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:44.370] CTL
[00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:44.490] and
[00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:44.890] CTL
[00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:45.230] star
[00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.830] that

[00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:46.270] with
[00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:46.670] branching

[00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.930] Those
[00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:48.390] are
[00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:48.530] sort
[00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.590] of

[00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.210] logic
[00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.410] that
[00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:50.570] add
[00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:50.690] a
[00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.850] few
[00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.170] other
[00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.790] operators
[00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.730] that
[00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:53.030] allow
[00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.390] you
[00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:53.550] to
[00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:53.750] reason
[00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.090] over
[00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:54.530] multiple
[00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.890] paths.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:55.940] But
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:56.080] for
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.220] our
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:56.480] purposes,
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:56.800] we're
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:56.920] just
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.020] going
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.040] to
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.160] be
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.400] using
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:57.840] the

[00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:58.800] model.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:01.300] So
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:01.460] kind
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:01.520] of
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:01.640] as
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:01.760] a
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.080] recap
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.140] of
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:03.780] what
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.140] linear
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:04.480] temporal
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:04.840] logic
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.220] involves,
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.180] we're
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:06.360] using
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:06.540] this
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:06.780] linear
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.060] time
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:07.340] model.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:08.780] Another
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:09.100] important
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.520] distinction
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:09.840] is
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.040] that
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.500] we're
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:10.800] actually
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:10.920] going
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:10.940] to
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.060] be
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:11.320] talking
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.520] about
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:11.900] infinite
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.420] sequences
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:12.700] of
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:12.940] states.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.440] So
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:14.880] instead
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.080] of
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.240] us
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.520] just
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.800] reasoning
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.120] up
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.420] until
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:17.640] a
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:17.820] certain
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.040] goal
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.400] condition
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:18.580] is
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:18.760] met,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.220] we're
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:19.440] thinking
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:19.740] about
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.360] systems
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:20.620] that
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:20.940] could
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.700] theoretically
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.420] keep
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:22.920] transitioning
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.200] over
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:23.620] time,
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.220] over
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:24.420] and
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:24.600] over
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:24.720] and
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:24.920] over
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.340] into
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:25.500] the
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:25.740] future.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:26.680] So
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:26.900] if
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:26.980] you
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.120] have
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.360] one

[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.300] machines,
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:28.780] you're
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:28.860] going
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:28.860] to
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.020] think
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:29.180] at
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.380] each
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.600] time
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:29.880] step,
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.140] it's
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.240] going
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:30.320] to
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:30.500] visit
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:30.680] a
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:30.820] new
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.100] state.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.040] And
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.300] if
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.420] you
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:32.560] give
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:32.660] it
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:32.840] enough
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.140] time,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.360] it's
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:33.500] just
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:33.620] going
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:33.720] to
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.200] generate
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:34.380] an
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:34.620] infinite

[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.240] of

[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.060] And
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.180] we
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:36.300] can
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:36.640] actually
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.260] express
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.680] properties
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:37.880] that
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.040] can
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.280] hold
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:38.660] over

[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.460] not
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:40.840] just

[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:42.860] that
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:42.980] we
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.140] might
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:43.460] usually
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:43.700] think

[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.700] And
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.300] linear
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:47.580] temporal
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:47.840] logic
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.060] can
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.320] actually
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:48.520] be
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:48.840] modified
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.460] to
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:49.840] work

[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.640] It
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:52.860] just
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.340] requires
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.120] an

[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:54.880] operator.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:56.720] But
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.360] the

[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.040] gives
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.480] us

[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:04.720] regardless

[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:05.540] we're
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:05.760] talking.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:09.720] Finally,
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:10.820] all
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:10.960] the
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.440] operators
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:11.640] we're
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:11.720] going
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:11.780] to
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:11.860] be
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.100] looking
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.320] at
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:12.500] in

[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.480] system
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.720] are
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:15.860] what
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:15.960] we

[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:16.760]-looking
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.320] conditions.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:18.260] So
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.860] when
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:20.340] we're
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:20.480] given
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:20.680] a

[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:21.600] we're
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:21.700] going
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:21.720] to

[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:22.620] what's
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:22.720] going
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:22.800] to

[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.080] for

[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:26.540] in
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:26.620] the
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:26.880] future.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:27.800] There's
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.040] a
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.480] symmetric
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.020] version
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:29.820] of
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.240] this
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.640] logic
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.120] that

[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.160] past.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:33.640] So
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:33.880] for
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.160] example,
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:34.560] we
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:34.720] could

[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:37.560] that
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:37.900] something
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.460] will

[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:40.900] There's
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.060] a
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:41.560] symmetric
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.020] version
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.160] where
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.240] we
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:42.360] could
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:42.540] talk
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:42.880] about,
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:43.840] given

[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:44.700] we
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:44.840] can
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.120] guarantee
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.300] that
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:45.520] something
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.060] had
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.840] eventually
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.220] happened
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:47.360] in
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:47.460] the
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:47.860] past.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.220] But
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.340] for
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:49.640] us,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.300] in
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:50.460] that
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:50.640] we're
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:50.960] going
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.020] to
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.240] focus
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:51.380] on
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:51.740] planning,
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.200] we're
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.520] typically
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.180] planning
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:53.380] about

[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:53.620] to

[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:53.800] in
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:53.880] the
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.140] future.
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:54.460] It
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:54.660] makes
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.040] more
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.400] sense
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:55.600] for

[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:55.960] to

[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:56.460] this

[00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.830] And
[00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:01.930] so
[00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:02.010] I
[00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:02.130] guess
[00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:02.550] one

[00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.630] that

[00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.210] is
[00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:06.330] that
[00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:06.590] because
[00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.750] we're
[00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.130] using
[00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:07.950] a

[00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:09.150] and
[00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.250] not

[00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.930] model
[00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.070] of
[00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:10.310] time,
[00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:11.210] we're
[00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.370] going
[00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:11.390] to
[00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:11.510] be
[00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:11.850] expressing
[00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:12.310] properties
[00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.510] that
[00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:12.710] happen
[00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.910] over
[00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.070] a

[00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:13.690] of
[00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:13.990] states
[00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:14.890] and
[00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.170] not

[00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.730] that
[00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:15.910] happen
[00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.230] over

[00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:22.550] So
[00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.850] finally,
[00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.110] I'm
[00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.230] just
[00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.330] going
[00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:23.390] to
[00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:23.590] talk
[00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.930] about
[00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.530] a
[00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:24.670] couple
[00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.770] of
[00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:24.850] the

[00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:25.530] applications
[00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.230] for

[00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:27.710] temporal
[00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:28.070] logic
[00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.330] before
[00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:29.690] Ellie
[00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.930] will
[00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:30.250] dive
[00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:30.470] in
[00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.670] and
[00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.030] actually
[00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.750] talk
[00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.950] more
[00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:32.130] about
[00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:32.270] the
[00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:32.690] semantics
[00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.970] and
[00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:33.110] the
[00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.490] syntax
[00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.090] of
[00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:34.450] how
[00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:34.570] we
[00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:34.770] use
[00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:34.910] this
[00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:35.190] logic.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:37.580] So
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.200] the
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.400] first
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:38.580] main
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:38.800] use
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.220] is

[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:40.660] model
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:40.960] checking.
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.500] We
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:42.900] can
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.760] use
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.300] this

[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.100] to
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:46.740] create
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.620] guarantees
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.220] about
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:49.880] a
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.260] system
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.180] and
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:51.580] formally
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.480] verify
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:52.840] it
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.840] for
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.260] a
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:54.400] couple
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:54.480] of
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:54.700] different
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.300] properties.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.060] For
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.360] example,
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:56.880] we
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.000] can
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.140] talk
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:57.280] about
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:57.420] the

[00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:57.960] the
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.300] system.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:58.500] We
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:58.600] can
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:58.840] say,
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.280] over
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:00.440] the
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:00.620] course
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:00.720] of
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:00.800] the
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.120] system,
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:01.320] we
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:01.720] guarantee
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.220] that
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:02.320] it
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:02.440] will
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:02.720] never
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.140] enter
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.800] a

[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.180] with
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:04.280] a
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:04.420] certain
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:04.780] condition.
[00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.070] We
[00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:06.190] can
[00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:06.390] also
[00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.230] talk
[00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.390] about
[00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:07.510] the

[00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.010] of
[00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:08.330] properties.
[00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:08.710] So
[00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:09.330] over
[00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:09.470] the
[00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.750] entire
[00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:10.130] lifetime
[00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:10.630] of
[00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:10.850] the
[00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.230] system,
[00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:11.850] we
[00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.210] guarantee
[00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:12.910] that
[00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.150] a
[00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.330] certain
[00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:13.730] condition
[00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.970] will
[00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:14.190] always
[00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:14.450] hold.
[00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:18.230] The
[00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.510] other
[00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:18.970] main
[00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:19.470] application
[00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:19.770] for
[00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:19.990] temporal
[00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.370] logic,
[00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.970] one
[00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:21.090] that
[00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:21.190] we're
[00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:21.310] going
[00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.310] to
[00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.430] be
[00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.750] focusing
[00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.050] on,
[00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.730] is
[00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.990] for
[00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.370] planning.
[00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:24.370] And
[00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:24.550] this
[00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.690] is
[00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:25.050] planning
[00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:25.530] using
[00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:26.070] these
[00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:26.410] temporally
[00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:26.770] extended
[00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.090] goals
[00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:27.230] that
[00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.330] I've
[00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:27.410] been
[00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:27.630] talking
[00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:27.930] about.
[00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:28.890] And
[00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:29.070] it
[00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:29.350] actually
[00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.970] extends
[00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:30.290] nicely
[00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.490] to
[00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:30.730] talking
[00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:31.030] about
[00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.790] temporally
[00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.130] extended
[00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:32.610] preferences.
[00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:33.250] So
[00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:33.870] this
[00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.150] is
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.420] given
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:35.600] that
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:35.720] we
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:35.940] have
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.200] a
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.360] number
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:36.480] of

[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.220] that
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:37.420] could
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:37.640] reach
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:37.760] a
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:37.940] goal,
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:38.440] we
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:38.560] can
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:38.780] actually
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:38.960] look
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.060] at
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.200] all
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:39.480] those
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:39.680] and
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:39.840] see
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.220] which
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:40.520] paths
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.120] satisfy
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:41.800] certain
[00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.710] conditions
[00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:44.010] over
[00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:44.170] the
[00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.670] sequence
[00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.910] of
[00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:46.210] states
[00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.110] and
[00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.350] use
[00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.550] those
[00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.910] conditions
[00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.150] as
[00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.230] a
[00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.370] way
[00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:48.570] of
[00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.090] choosing
[00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:49.290] which
[00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:49.470] ones
[00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:49.590] we
[00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.870] prefer.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:51.540] So
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:51.860] with
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.200] that,
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.140] Ellie
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:53.340] is

[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:53.780] going
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:53.880] to
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.080] talk
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.500] about

[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.140] Hi
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:03.420] guys,
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:03.720] my

[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:04.340] Ellie.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:05.600] And
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:05.920] I'm
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:05.980] going
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:05.980] to
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.140] be
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:06.180] talking
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:06.380] about

[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.500] of
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.000] LTL.
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.480] So
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.080] an
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:11.400] LTL
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:11.780] formula
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.400] is
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:12.620] a
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:12.920] series
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.120] of
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.620] states.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.360] And
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:14.560] at
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:14.800] each
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.260] state,
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:15.540] you
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:15.660] can
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:15.820] have
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.200] various
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.880] propositions
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.140] that
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.260] can
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:17.420] be
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:17.680] either
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:17.960] true
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.120] or
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.480] false.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:19.320] So
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:19.600] for
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.020] example,
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.160] is
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.260] it
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:22.480] okay
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:22.620] if
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:22.680] I
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:22.960] erase
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.120] this?
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.640] Yeah,
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:23.960] go
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.180] ahead.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.620] So
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:28.980] for
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.440] example,
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.040] as
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.180] Ben's
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.580] animation
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:33.940] showed
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.100] me,
[00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.470] these
[00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.590] are
[00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:36.070] states
[00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.370] that
[00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.530] go
[00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:37.790] on
[00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:38.030] to
[00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.470] infinity.
[00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:39.690] And
[00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:39.910] at
[00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.170] each
[00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:40.550] state,
[00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:40.750] you
[00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:40.890] can
[00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:41.250] have
[00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.390] propositions
[00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:42.550] that
[00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.650] are
[00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.870] either
[00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.110] true
[00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.270] or
[00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:43.590] false.
[00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.170] So
[00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:44.350] the
[00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.650] traffic
[00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:44.850] light
[00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:45.010] could
[00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:45.130] be
[00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:45.450] red,
[00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:45.770] could
[00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:45.870] be
[00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.990] an
[00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.250] example
[00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:46.410] of
[00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:46.490] a
[00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:46.910] proposition.
[00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:47.590] We
[00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.710] could
[00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.910] be
[00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:48.450] stopped.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.080] And
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.280] there's
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:58.600] various
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.080] logical
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.580] operators
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:16:59.800] that
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:16:59.900] we
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.020] can
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.500] apply
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:00.780] to
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.080] these
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:01.540] formulas,
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:01.980] these
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.220] sets
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:02.360] of
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:02.860] states.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.360] And
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:03.520] we
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:03.700] can
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.700] determine
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:04.960] if
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.300] these
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.120] logical
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:06.520] operators
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:06.740] are
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:06.940] either
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.240] true
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:07.400] or
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:07.740] false
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.140] about
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:08.720] each
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.200] set
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.360] of
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:12.580] states,
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:12.820] each
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.100] formula.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.220] So
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.460] there's
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:14.560] the
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:14.720] not
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.020] operator,
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:15.260] the
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:15.420] or
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:15.840] operator,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.140] the
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:16.560] and,
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:16.880] the
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.380] implies,
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:17.680] if
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:17.800] and
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.040] only
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:18.360] if,
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.160] and
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.760] like
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:19.900] I
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.060] said
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.260] this
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:20.540] week,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.300] each
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.160] proposition
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.400] at
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:22.540] this
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:22.700] week
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:22.840] can
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:22.980] either
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.180] be
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:23.480] true
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:23.700] or
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.040] false.
[00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.990] So
[00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.250] just
[00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:26.370] to
[00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:26.470] go
[00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.590] into
[00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.790] some
[00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:27.210] examples
[00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:27.430] of
[00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:27.690] these,
[00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.650] the
[00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.970] logical
[00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:31.430] operator
[00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:32.050] true
[00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:32.730] says
[00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.210] that
[00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:33.710] there
[00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.970] is,
[00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:35.030] essentially
[00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:35.250] what
[00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:35.390] the
[00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.790] operator
[00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:36.330] true
[00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:36.830] says
[00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.250] is
[00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.450] it's
[00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:37.630] not
[00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.950] saying,
[00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.330] oh,
[00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.690] this
[00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.050] state
[00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.290] is
[00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:39.590] true.
[00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.150] The
[00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.430] operator
[00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.730] just
[00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:40.970] true
[00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.250] says
[00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:41.390] that
[00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.550] there
[00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:41.790] are
[00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:42.230] states
[00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.410] for
[00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:42.570] all
[00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:42.910] infinity.
[00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:43.330] So
[00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:43.670] true
[00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.270] is
[00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.610] always
[00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:44.970] true.
[00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.290] So
[00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:45.430] no
[00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.610] matter
[00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:45.790] what
[00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:45.950] you
[00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:46.250] had
[00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.430] for
[00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.570] your
[00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:46.830] states
[00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.210] here,
[00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:47.770] the
[00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:48.090] logical
[00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:48.510] operator
[00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.950] true
[00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:49.490] holds.
[00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.170] However,
[00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:51.650] when
[00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.770] you
[00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:52.050] talk
[00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:52.250] about
[00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.410] the
[00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:52.670] logical
[00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.030] operator
[00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:53.470] true
[00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.710] with
[00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.990] respect
[00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.130] to
[00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:54.190] a
[00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:54.410] certain
[00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:55.010] state
[00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.410] or
[00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:55.510] a
[00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.650] certain
[00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:56.150] proposition,
[00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:56.890] I
[00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:57.050] mean,
[00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.590] then
[00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.930] it
[00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:58.070] can
[00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.230] either
[00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.390] be
[00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.530] true
[00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:58.730] or
[00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.990] false.
[00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.510] So
[00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.670] for
[00:17:59.670 --> 00:17:59.870] example
[00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.290] here,
[00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:01.390] the
[00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.790] logical
[00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:02.690] operator
[00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.490] red,
[00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:03.930] light,
[00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.890] is
[00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:05.510] true
[00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.930] at
[00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:06.050] the
[00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:06.350] first
[00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.730] state.
[00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.310] If
[00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.470] this
[00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.650] was
[00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:08.970] green,
[00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.450] then
[00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:09.590] the
[00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.870] logical
[00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:10.270] operator
[00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.510] red
[00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.690] would
[00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:10.830] be
[00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.130] false
[00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:11.310] at
[00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.430] the

[00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:11.870] state.
[00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:12.050] Does
[00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:12.170] that
[00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:12.310] make
[00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.510] sense?
[00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:14.270] All
[00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.430] right.
[00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.430] One
[00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.810] important
[00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:17.030] thing
[00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:17.210] to
[00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:17.530] note
[00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:17.930] about
[00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:18.170] the
[00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:18.470] logical
[00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.970] operators
[00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:19.930] is
[00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:20.770] that
[00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:20.970] they
[00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.370] just
[00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.030] apply
[00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:22.570] to
[00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:22.750] the

[00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.730] in
[00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:23.890] your
[00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:24.270] sequence.
[00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:25.150] So
[00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:25.590] when
[00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.750] we're
[00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.090] discussing
[00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.570] logical
[00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.990] operators,
[00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.290] we
[00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:27.670] haven't
[00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:27.930] gotten
[00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:28.090] to
[00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:28.230] the
[00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.570] point
[00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:29.270] where
[00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.510] we
[00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.930] can
[00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:30.950] express
[00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:31.730] temporal
[00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.690] information
[00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.010] about
[00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:34.230] our
[00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.570] sequence
[00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:34.750] of
[00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:35.090] states.
[00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.550] The
[00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:40.750] next
[00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.070] operator
[00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.450] is
[00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.750] not.
[00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:42.710] So
[00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:43.130] as
[00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.250] you
[00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:43.410] can
[00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:43.610] see
[00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.090] here,
[00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.550] the

[00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:46.030] light
[00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:46.210] is

[00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:47.010] the

[00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.490] state.
[00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.450] So
[00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:48.690] the
[00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:48.870] traffic
[00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:49.150] light
[00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:49.370] is
[00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.650] not
[00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.130] green
[00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:50.810] holds
[00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:51.290] because
[00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.130] the
[00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.670] proposition
[00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.170] green
[00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:53.510] is

[00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:53.950] true
[00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:54.070] at
[00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.190] the
[00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.390] first
[00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.710] state.
[00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.190] And
[00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.330] the
[00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.250] logical
[00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:57.630] operator
[00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.110] and,
[00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.250] right,
[00:18:59.250 --> 00:18:59.690] at
[00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.850] this
[00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:00.130] first
[00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:00.390] state
[00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.730] means
[00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:01.270] we're
[00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.390] at
[00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:01.510] the
[00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.650] red
[00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:01.910] light
[00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.530] and
[00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:02.750] we're
[00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.870] getting
[00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.330] gas.
[00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.790] And
[00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:04.150] so
[00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.130] both
[00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:05.790] that
[00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:05.930] we're
[00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:06.070] at
[00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.170] the
[00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:06.330] red
[00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:06.510] light
[00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.650] and
[00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:06.730] that
[00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:06.790] we're
[00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:06.970] getting
[00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:07.450] gas
[00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:07.830] holds
[00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.990] for
[00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.130] the
[00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:08.370] first
[00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:08.650] state.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:12.520] And
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:12.780] then
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.920] the
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.320] operator
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:14.700] or
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.480] essentially
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.180] says,
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:16.940] I
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.220] guess
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:17.340] a
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:17.500] lot
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:17.580] of
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:17.660] this
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:17.780] is
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:17.960] probably
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.300] related
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:18.380] to
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:18.520] you
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:18.760] guys,
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.120] logical
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:19.580] operators,
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.060] but
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.180] essentially,
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:21.620] if
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:21.740] you
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.000] have
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.540] red
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:22.740] or
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.180] green,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.420] then
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:24.540] you
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:24.660] could
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:24.880] either
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.220] have
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:25.460] the

[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:25.780] light
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:25.920] be
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.160] red
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:26.340] or
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:26.480] the
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:26.700] traffic
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:26.840] light
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.000] be
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.200] green
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:27.300] at
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:27.400] the
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:27.640] first
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:27.980] state.
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:28.900] And
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.220] as
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:29.360] long
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:29.480] as
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:29.660] one
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:29.760] of
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.000] those
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:30.360] two
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:30.720] holds
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:30.860] or
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.140] both
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:31.280] of
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:31.400] them
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:31.660] holds,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.300] then
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.000] it's
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.300] true.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:34.560] And
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:34.900] one
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.040] thing
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.220] to
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:35.560] note
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.100] about
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.380] or,
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.200] implies,
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:38.500] and
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:38.700] if
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:38.820] and
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.160] only
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:39.400] if,
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:39.920] these
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.040] can
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.200] be
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.660] rewritten
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.120] with
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.400] just
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:41.600] the

[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.700] and,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.160] and
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.440] not.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.120] So
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.140] another
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.320] way
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.420] of

[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:52.540] and
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:52.740] it's
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:52.940] not
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.160] green.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.720] And
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:54.980] I'm
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.100] not
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:55.240] gonna
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.400] go
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:55.540] over
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:55.700] that
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:55.880] for
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.280] implies
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.420] and
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:56.560] if
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:56.660] and
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:56.860] only
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.040] if,
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:57.880] just
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.020] for
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:58.140] the
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.260] sake
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.400] of
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:58.660] time.
[00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:02.090] So
[00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.490] that's
[00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:02.630] just
[00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.730] a
[00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.070] review
[00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.310] of
[00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.410] the
[00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:03.710] logical
[00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:04.130] operators.
[00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:04.410] And
[00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:04.710] now
[00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:05.170] we're
[00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:05.210] gonna
[00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.350] go
[00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.470] into
[00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:05.610] the
[00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:05.870] temporal
[00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:06.230] operators.
[00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:06.630] So
[00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:07.570] when
[00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:07.670] we're
[00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:07.850] talking
[00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:08.090] about
[00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.230] our
[00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.770] economist
[00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:09.070] car,
[00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:09.630] what
[00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.750] are
[00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.010] some
[00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.790] useful
[00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.450] temporal
[00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.970] operators?
[00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.530] Because
[00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:13.070] up
[00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.270] until
[00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.470] now,
[00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:13.650] we
[00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:13.830] just
[00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.990] are
[00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.330] describing
[00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:14.490] the
[00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:14.690] first
[00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:14.970] state
[00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:15.090] in
[00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:15.170] our
[00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:15.510] sequence,
[00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:16.170] which
[00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:16.270] is
[00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.350] a
[00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.490] really
[00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.870] useful
[00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:17.090] if
[00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.210] we
[00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.470] wanna
[00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.150] talk
[00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:18.490] about
[00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:18.810] the
[00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:19.150] entire
[00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.050] set
[00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:20.190] of
[00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.630] sequences
[00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:21.710] or
[00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.910] set
[00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:22.050] of
[00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:22.310] states.
[00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.490] So
[00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:23.890] what
[00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:23.990] do
[00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.030] you
[00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.190] guys
[00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.330] think
[00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:24.430] are
[00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.590] some
[00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.790] useful
[00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.030] things
[00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:25.130] that
[00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.250] we
[00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.450] wanna
[00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:25.610] be
[00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.730] able
[00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.910] to
[00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.390] describe?
[00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.070] I
[00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.190] know
[00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.430] Ben
[00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.730] touched
[00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:27.910] on
[00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:28.170] some
[00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:28.290] of
[00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:28.470] them
[00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.810] at
[00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:28.930] the
[00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:29.190] beginning,
[00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.510] but
[00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.690] if
[00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.770] you
[00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:29.930] guys
[00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:30.070] could
[00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.390] recount
[00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.610] some
[00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:30.710] of
[00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.950] them.
[00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:31.270] Yes?
[00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.870] State
[00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:32.150] transitions.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.200] Mm
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.300]-hmm,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:33.760] state
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.040] transitions.
[00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:37.770] So,
[00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:38.210] exactly.
[00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.670] So
[00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:38.950] if
[00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:39.190] I'm
[00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.330] in
[00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:39.450] a
[00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:39.590] state
[00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.790] right
[00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.170] now,
[00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.770] might
[00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:40.870] I
[00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:41.050] be
[00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:41.330] concerned
[00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.570] about
[00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.750] the
[00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.950] next
[00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:42.210] state?
[00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.490] Is
[00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:42.610] that
[00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:42.790] kind
[00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:42.850] of
[00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:42.970] like
[00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:43.050] what
[00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:43.170] you're
[00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:43.370] saying?
[00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:44.930] Exactly,
[00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:45.210] yeah.
[00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.550] So
[00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:45.910] next
[00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:46.110] is
[00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.330] one
[00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:46.510] of
[00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.790] the
[00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.110] things
[00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.250] that
[00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:47.350] we
[00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.510] might
[00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.670] be
[00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:47.910] concerned
[00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:48.290] about,
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:49.780] the
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.040] next
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:50.360] state.
[00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:56.970] Are
[00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:57.130] there
[00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:57.370] any
[00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:57.590] other
[00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.850] things
[00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:57.950] you
[00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:58.130] guys
[00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.270] can
[00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.410] think
[00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:58.610] of?
[00:20:58.890 --> 00:20:59.230] Yes?
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.460] Always
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:00.880] or
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.260] both
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:01.440] of
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.560] them?
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:01.880] Yeah,
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:02.260] exactly,
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:02.880] always.
[00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:10.070] So,
[00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.610] like
[00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:14.870] Ben
[00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.070] said,
[00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:15.270] we
[00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.490] always
[00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:15.770] wanna
[00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.010] follow
[00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.170] the
[00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:16.310] speed
[00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.490] limit.
[00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:16.670] We
[00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:16.850] always
[00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.970] wanna
[00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:17.110] be

[00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:17.750] 35
[00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.030] miles
[00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:18.210] an
[00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:18.370] hour,
[00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.690] whatever
[00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:18.970] the
[00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:19.150] speed
[00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:19.350] limit
[00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.670] is.
[00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.570] Anything
[00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:20.890] else?
[00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.350] Yes?
[00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:23.270] Until,
[00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:23.950] yeah.
[00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:24.910] So,
[00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.570] like
[00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:25.750] he
[00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.950] said,
[00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.210] we
[00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.450] want
[00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.610] to
[00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:26.830] be

[00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:27.930] until
[00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:28.190] the
[00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.370] light
[00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.610] turns
[00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:29.030] green.
[00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:30.390] Yes?
[00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:30.990] Eventually.
[00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:31.730] Eventually,
[00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:32.130] yeah.
[00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:33.130] So
[00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:33.270] we
[00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.830] eventually
[00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.630] want
[00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.770] to
[00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:35.930] get
[00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:36.290] gas.
[00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.710] And
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.160] eventually,
[00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.170] any
[00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:43.410] other
[00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:43.710] things?

[00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.570] this
[00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.850] state.
[00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.590] At
[00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.750] this
[00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.890] state,
[00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:46.070] yep.
[00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.570] And
[00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:46.870] so,
[00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.350] at
[00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.550] this
[00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:47.970] state
[00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:48.730] is
[00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:49.110] kind
[00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.230] of
[00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:49.390] what
[00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.530] the
[00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:49.790] logical
[00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.170] operators
[00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:50.290] were
[00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:50.470] doing
[00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.590] in
[00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.690] the
[00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.910] beginning,
[00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:51.130] but
[00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:51.230] I
[00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.430] agree
[00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.610] that's
[00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:51.790] something
[00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:51.930] we
[00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:52.090] have
[00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:52.190] to
[00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.310] be
[00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.450] able
[00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:52.590] to
[00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.910] express.
[00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:54.390] So,
[00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.750] that's
[00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.330] not
[00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:55.570] a
[00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:55.970] specific
[00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:56.350] temporal
[00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.710] operator,
[00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.950] but
[00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:57.110] it's
[00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.450] included
[00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:57.570] in
[00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:57.670] the
[00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:57.910] logical
[00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:58.150] as
[00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:58.270] well.
[00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:58.350] I'll
[00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.470] just
[00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.610] write
[00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.710] it
[00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.830] up
[00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.970] here
[00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:59.170] for
[00:21:59.170 --> 00:21:59.390] you.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:00.580] Oh,
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:00.820] can
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:00.960] I
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.060] ask
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:01.180] a
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:01.340] question?
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.040] Uh
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:02.120]-huh.
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:02.460] So
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:02.660] the
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.080] logical
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:03.720] operators,
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:03.940] are
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:04.040] they
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:04.380] acting
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:04.600] on
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:04.760] the,
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.460] so
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:05.640] they're
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:05.860] acting
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.140] for
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:06.300] a
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:06.520] state,
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:06.760] they're
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:06.880] not
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.140] acting
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.280] on
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:07.440] the
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:07.740] transition?
[00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.810] Exactly,
[00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:09.210] they
[00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:09.410] act
[00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:09.550] for
[00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:09.670] a
[00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:09.850] state.
[00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.070] And
[00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.210] so,
[00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.410] if
[00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:10.550] you
[00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:10.910] just
[00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:11.350] wrote
[00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.010] the
[00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:12.730] logical
[00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:13.410] operators,
[00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.270] by,
[00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.570] just
[00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.710] by
[00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.850] the
[00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:15.250] definition
[00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:15.450] of
[00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:15.790] LTO,
[00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:15.970] it
[00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:16.150] means
[00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:16.910] let's
[00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:17.110] just
[00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.930] analyze
[00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:18.150] the
[00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:18.550] first
[00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:18.890] state
[00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:19.430] and
[00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.610] see
[00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:19.750] if
[00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.990] it's
[00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.290] true.
[00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.910] And
[00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:21.090] so,
[00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.250] it
[00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:21.510] won't
[00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.670] tell
[00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:21.750] us
[00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.990] anything
[00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.210] about
[00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:22.330] the
[00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:22.590] third
[00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.750] state
[00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.830] or
[00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.970] the
[00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:23.210] fourth
[00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.410] state
[00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:23.510] or
[00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.630] the
[00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.870] second
[00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:24.250] state,
[00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.770] which
[00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.890] is
[00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:25.010] why
[00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.150] we
[00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:25.330] have
[00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:25.430] to
[00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.630] look
[00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:25.790] at
[00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:26.290] the
[00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:26.570] next
[00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.790] state.
[00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.130] So,
[00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:27.310] yeah.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.380] Any
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:29.620] other
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:29.960] questions?
[00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:36.230] So,
[00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.630] like
[00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.830] you
[00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.070] said,
[00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:37.910] next
[00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:38.050] is
[00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:38.170] an
[00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:38.390] important
[00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.670] one.
[00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.710] So,
[00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.110] right
[00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.270] here
[00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.410] we
[00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:41.710] consider,
[00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:42.050] okay,
[00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.370] the
[00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:42.630] next
[00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.870] light
[00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:43.050] will
[00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:43.210] be
[00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:43.490] green.
[00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.990] And
[00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.390] Intel
[00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.210] is
[00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:49.390] the
[00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.610] one
[00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.970] that
[00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:50.410] she
[00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:50.730] mentioned.
[00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:51.150] So,
[00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:51.790] the
[00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:52.070] red
[00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.250] is,
[00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.570] the
[00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:52.750] light
[00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.890] will
[00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:53.030] be
[00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:53.390] red
[00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.850] until
[00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.010] it
[00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.350] becomes
[00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.810] green,
[00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.810] eventually.
[00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:00.130] So,
[00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:01.090] the
[00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:01.250] light
[00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.390] will
[00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.890] eventually,
[00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.150] at
[00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:02.310] some
[00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.490] point
[00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:02.610] in
[00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:02.730] the
[00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:03.110] future,
[00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.430] turn
[00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.830] green.
[00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:04.050] So,
[00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:04.150] we
[00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:04.270] might
[00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:04.470] be
[00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.770] waiting
[00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:04.930] at
[00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.070] the
[00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.210] red
[00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.370] light
[00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:05.530] for
[00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:05.630] a
[00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.870] long
[00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:06.190] time,
[00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:06.350] but
[00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.710] eventually
[00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.990] it's
[00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.110] gonna
[00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.330] turn
[00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:07.550] green
[00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:07.710] for
[00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.990] us.
[00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:10.350] The
[00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.470] light
[00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.610] will
[00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.910] always
[00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:11.090] be
[00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:11.330] red.
[00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:12.030] So,
[00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.130] I
[00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:12.270] guess
[00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:12.410] you're
[00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:12.670] stuck
[00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:12.790] at
[00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:12.930] the
[00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.230] traffic
[00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.430] light
[00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.590] for
[00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.670] a
[00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:13.830] long
[00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:14.130] time.
[00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:14.970] Or
[00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:15.350] globally,
[00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:15.670] that's
[00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:15.850] another
[00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:16.050] name
[00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:16.230] for
[00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.610] always.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:18.880] And
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.320] lastly,
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.000] this
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.140] one
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.300] is
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:20.440] a
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:20.640] little
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:20.980] bit
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.800] less
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.380] intuitive.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:25.180] So,
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:25.360] what
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:25.620] this
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:25.780] is
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.140] saying
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.680] is
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.380] the
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:27.600] light
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:27.780] will
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.240] always
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.460] be
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:28.900] red
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.360] until
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:30.800] another
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.440] circumstance
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.000] coincides
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.140] at
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:32.300] the
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:32.660] same
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.220] state.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:33.780] So,
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:33.920] the
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.080] light
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.200] will
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:34.380] be
[00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:34.740] always
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.060] red
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:35.360] until
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:35.620] the
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:35.800] car
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.020] gets
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.400] gas.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:36.720] And
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:36.900] then
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.300] after
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.300] it
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:38.540] gets
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:38.740] its
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.100] gas,
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:39.500] then
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:39.680] the
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:39.860] red
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.000] is
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.400] released
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:40.700] and
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:40.820] the
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.000] light
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.160] can
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.340] be
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:41.580] either
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:41.900] green
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.140] or
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:42.360] red
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:42.680] after
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:42.960] that.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:43.860] So,
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.000] we
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.180] have
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:44.420] red,
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:44.600] red,
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:44.800] red,
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:44.940] red,
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.200] red
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.680] until
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.620] we
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:46.780] have
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.140] both
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:47.500] red
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.100] and
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:48.540] gas.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:49.540] And
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:49.740] then
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:49.900] it
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:50.020] can
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.120] be
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:50.320] green
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:50.440] or
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:50.520] it
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:50.600] can
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:50.700] be
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:50.840] red
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.040] after
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.220] that.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:51.700] It's
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:51.900] not
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.300] constrained
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:52.460] to
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:52.600] being
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:52.860] red.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:53.340] Does
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:53.440] that
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:53.580] make
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:53.740] sense?
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:54.420] That
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:54.540] was
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:54.660] a
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:54.760] little
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:54.880] bit
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.040] less
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.360] intuitive.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:55.860] So,
[00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.150] is
[00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:57.230] that
[00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.350] good?
[00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.310] All
[00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.410] right,
[00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.550] so
[00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:04.730] now
[00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.870] I'm
[00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:05.070] going
[00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.210] to,
[00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.530] now
[00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:05.630] that
[00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.790] we've
[00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:05.930] gone
[00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:06.250] over
[00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:06.530] just
[00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:06.690] the
[00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:07.150] intuitive
[00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.630] understanding
[00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.790] of
[00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:08.890] that,
[00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:09.070] I'm
[00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.130] gonna
[00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:09.310] give
[00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.390] you
[00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.510] the
[00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.730] actual
[00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:10.150] syntax
[00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:10.690] for
[00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:10.910] that.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.440] So,
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:13.480] X
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:13.760] is
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.280] representative
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.180] of
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:15.580] next.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:16.780] So,
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:16.980] in
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.100] the
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.380] first
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:17.700] state,
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:17.960] we
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.200] don't
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:18.660] care
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.340] if
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:19.800] P
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.020] is
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:20.440] true.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.080] P
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.260] could
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:21.380] be
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:21.540] not
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:21.760] true.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:21.940] P
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:22.080] could
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:22.200] be
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:22.380] true.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:22.500] It
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:22.680] doesn't
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:22.980] matter.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:23.420] But
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:23.540] in
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:23.720] the
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.000] second
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.420] state,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.200] the
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.540] next
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:25.700] one
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:25.880] after
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.080] the
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:26.320] first
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:26.540] state,
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:26.780] P
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.040] has
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:27.220] to
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:27.520] hold
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.180] in
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:28.380] order
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:28.700] for
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.280] XB
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:29.640] to
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.300] be
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:30.440] a
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:30.600] true
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:30.920] statement
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.180] about
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:31.340] our
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:31.520] sequence
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:31.700] of
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:31.940] states.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.000] So,
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:33.580] what
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:33.660] do
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:33.760] you
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.040] guys
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.460] think
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.860] if
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:39.680] I
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:39.840] wrote
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.320] this?
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.380] This
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:52.740] one
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:52.860] over
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.040] here?
[00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:55.150] Yeah,
[00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:55.630] perfect.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:58.080] All
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.220] right,
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:58.460] the
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:58.700] Intel
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.220] operator.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.400] The
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:00.580] Intel
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.020] operator
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.580] essentially
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.260] says,
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:03.900] like
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.260] Ben
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:04.480] said,
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:04.820] we're
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.360] stopped
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:05.940] until
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:06.140] the
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:06.280] light
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:06.480] is
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:06.780] green.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.600] So,
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:07.800] if
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:07.900] you
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.300] have

[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.300] W,
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:10.980] you
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.200] just,
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:11.480] P
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:11.620] has
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:11.720] to
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:11.740] be
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:11.860] true
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.000] in

[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:12.660] Intel
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.060] W,
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:13.560] and
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:13.800] after
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:13.980] that
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:14.200] point,
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:14.400] P
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:14.580] can
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:14.700] be
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.040] whatever
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.520] it
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:15.780] wants
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:15.920] to
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.100] be.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.040] The
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.440] eventually,
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:19.900] or
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.340] future
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:20.840] operator,
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:21.980] says
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.380] that
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:22.520] at
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:22.660] some
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:22.800] point
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:22.920] in
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.020] the
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:23.260] future,
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:23.860] we
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.000] will
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.160] get
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:24.520] gas.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:26.600] However,
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:26.800] it's
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:26.980] worth
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.180] a
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:27.420] note,
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:27.860] I
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:27.920] know
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.040] when
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:28.140] we
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:28.460] talked
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:28.660] about
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:28.900] getting
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.160] gas,
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:29.320] we
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:29.480] said,
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:29.620] oh,
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:29.740] we
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:29.900] have
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.040] to
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.380] always
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:30.700] get
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.220] gas
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:31.880] at
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.040] some
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:32.180] point
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:32.300] in
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:32.360] the
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:32.560] future.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.180] But
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:33.320] the
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:33.620] future
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.120] eventually
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:34.640] operator
[00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:35.340] is
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.400] just
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:36.660] at
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:36.920] one
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.160] point
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:37.300] in
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:37.420] the
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:37.680] future.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:38.320] So,
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:38.760] once
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:38.860] you
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:38.980] get
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:39.200] gas,
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:39.300] you
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:39.400] don't
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:39.520] have
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:39.600] to
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:39.700] get
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:39.780] it
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:40.000] again.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:40.420] Yes?
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:40.880] On
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.000] the
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.260] previous
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:41.460] slide,
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:41.540] you
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:41.640] had
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:41.760] a
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:41.960] note
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.160] at
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:42.280] the
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:42.540] bottom
[00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:43.180] that
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:43.520] said
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.280] that
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:44.680] W
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:44.800] is
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.100] required
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:45.240] to
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:45.480] become
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:45.660] true.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:45.860] Does
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:46.000] that
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.260] mean
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:46.720] an
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:46.920] Intel
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.420] operator
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.280] also
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:48.640] implies
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:48.780] a
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:48.980] future
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:49.400] operator
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:49.720] on
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:49.820] the
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.000] W?
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.140] Yeah.
[00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.850] But
[00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:54.270] it's
[00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:54.450] just
[00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:54.650] the
[00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:54.850] added
[00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:55.290] condition
[00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:55.530] that
[00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:55.690] P
[00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:55.810] will
[00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:55.990] be
[00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.230] true
[00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.650] Intel
[00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:56.830] the
[00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:57.050] W.
[00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:57.350] But
[00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.630] whenever
[00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.850] you
[00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:58.030] use
[00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:58.270] Intel,
[00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.590] you
[00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.870] say,
[00:25:59.010 --> 00:25:59.390] P
[00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.810] Intel
[00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:00.230] W.
[00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:00.710] Yeah.
[00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:00.970] But
[00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:01.050] you
[00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:01.310] also
[00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.530] have
[00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:01.650] to
[00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:01.870] add,
[00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.750] like.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.040] Yeah,
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:05.500] yep,
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:05.660] you're
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:05.840] right.
[00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:09.290] But
[00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:09.510] it'd
[00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.610] be
[00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:09.950] possible
[00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:10.130] that
[00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.210] your
[00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:10.470] system
[00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.750] just
[00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:11.030] stays
[00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:11.310] P,
[00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:11.570] right?
[00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:12.330] It
[00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:12.490] could,
[00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.750] yeah.
[00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.130] But
[00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.450] then,
[00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:14.010] if
[00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:14.390] your
[00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.830] system,
[00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:15.190] that'd
[00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.250] be
[00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:15.590] totally
[00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.890] fine
[00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:16.010] if
[00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.090] you
[00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:16.210] had
[00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:16.330] your
[00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:16.550] system
[00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:16.790] just
[00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:16.990] be
[00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.290] P.
[00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:17.910] But
[00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:18.150] then,
[00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:18.430] the
[00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.810] operator
[00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:19.190] P
[00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.470] Intel
[00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.990] W
[00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:21.070] wouldn't
[00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.470] hold
[00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.770] unless
[00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:21.930] you
[00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:22.050] had
[00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:22.170] a
[00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:22.410] W
[00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:22.610] at
[00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.850] some
[00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:23.110] point
[00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.290] in
[00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:23.430] that
[00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.730] sequence
[00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:23.910] of
[00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:24.150] Ps.
[00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.550] Does
[00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:25.670] that
[00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:25.810] make
[00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:25.970] sense?
[00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:26.510] Here.
[00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:27.210] I
[00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.330] mean,
[00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:27.670] I
[00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:27.850] guess
[00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:27.950] it
[00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:28.130] does
[00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.290] if
[00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:28.550] that's
[00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:28.670] the
[00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:28.810] way
[00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:28.910] to
[00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:29.110] do
[00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.230] it,
[00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:29.450] but
[00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.450] it
[00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:30.690] doesn't
[00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:30.890] make
[00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:31.130] sense,
[00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.470] does
[00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.830] it?
[00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:34.650] So,
[00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.390] you're
[00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:37.610] saying
[00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.710] that
[00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.790] we
[00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:37.910] could
[00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:38.130] have
[00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:38.270] a
[00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:38.430] bunch
[00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.570] of
[00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.770] Ps,
[00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:38.990] right?
[00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.390] And
[00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.630] I'm
[00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:42.010] saying
[00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:42.850] that
[00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:43.230] this
[00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.090] is
[00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:45.810] a

[00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.390] state
[00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.610] tag.
[00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.710] You
[00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.810] can
[00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:46.930] have
[00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:47.110] whatever
[00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.290] you
[00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:47.490] want
[00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:47.630] as
[00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.730] your
[00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:47.950] state,
[00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:48.150] and
[00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:48.310] we're
[00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.470] just
[00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.790] analyzing
[00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:49.470] if
[00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.710] a
[00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:50.390] sentence
[00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.650] is
[00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:50.870] true
[00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:51.090] about
[00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:51.230] it.
[00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:52.110] So,
[00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.350] this
[00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.830] statement,
[00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.550] it's
[00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:53.990] not
[00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.570] true,
[00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:54.950] or
[00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:55.230] sorry,
[00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.970] I'm
[00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:56.090] saying
[00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.250] that
[00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:56.470] it's
[00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.730] not
[00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:57.190] true,
[00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.950] it's
[00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:58.210] not
[00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:58.750] true
[00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.070] that
[00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.330] we
[00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:00.750] have
[00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.310] P
[00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.030] Intel
[00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:02.730] W.
[00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.670] But
[00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:05.910] if
[00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.050] we
[00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:06.230] add
[00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.330] in
[00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:06.410] a
[00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:06.630] W
[00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.070] somewhere,
[00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.910] and
[00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:08.050] we
[00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:08.250] keep
[00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:08.390] all
[00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.510] the
[00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.850] Ps,
[00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.910] then
[00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:10.330] it's
[00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:10.510] true
[00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.810] because
[00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:10.930] it
[00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:11.110] has
[00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.510] P,
[00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:12.570] oftentimes
[00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:12.790] we
[00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:12.910] get
[00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:13.070] to
[00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.390] a
[00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:13.610] W.
[00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.270] Does
[00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:15.370] that
[00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:15.510] make
[00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.630] sense?
[00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:16.070] It
[00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.330] makes
[00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:16.550] sense
[00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:16.670] if
[00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:16.870] that's
[00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.990] the
[00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.150] rule
[00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:17.270] of
[00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:17.410] this,
[00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:17.650] but
[00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:17.790] it
[00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:18.010] doesn't
[00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:18.210] make
[00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:18.370] sense
[00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:18.470] to
[00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.590] me
[00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.810] logically.
[00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:19.550] Okay,
[00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.610] so.
[00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.710] Is
[00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:19.810] the
[00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:20.030] statement
[00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:20.310] that
[00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.570] W
[00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:21.970] never
[00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:22.370] occurs?
[00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:23.070] Do
[00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.210] you
[00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.450] have
[00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.730] P
[00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:23.990] Intel
[00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.530] W
[00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:24.870] which
[00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.230] never
[00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.530] happened?
[00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:26.890] Yeah,
[00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:27.070] if
[00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.330] W
[00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:27.550] never
[00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:27.810] happened,
[00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.990] then
[00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.090] it
[00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:28.230] wouldn't
[00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.390] be
[00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:28.610] true.
[00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.410] I
[00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:30.510] mean,
[00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.130] technically,
[00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:31.470] in
[00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.790] English
[00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:32.170] language,
[00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.410] it
[00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:32.510] would
[00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.670] be
[00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:32.950] true.
[00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.350] I
[00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.610] mean,
[00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:33.930] I
[00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:34.110] guess
[00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.330] it's
[00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:34.430] not.
[00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.490] If
[00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.610] you
[00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:34.790] have
[00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:35.370] P
[00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.170] out
[00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:36.350] to
[00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.770] infinity,
[00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:37.490] then
[00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.570] you
[00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:37.830] never
[00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.090] have
[00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.330] W.
[00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:39.270] P
[00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:39.510] Intel
[00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.190] W
[00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.490] is
[00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.690] true.
[00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.750] P
[00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.970] Intel
[00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:42.190] A
[00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.570] is
[00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:42.770] true.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:43.680] Like
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:43.860] if
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:43.980] you
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.240] say
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:44.540] that
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:44.740] I'm
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:45.080] hungry
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.480] until
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.700] I
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.000] eat,
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:46.220] and
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:46.320] you
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:46.540] never
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:46.840] eat,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.040] then
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:47.280] you'll
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:47.600] always
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:47.800] be
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.100] hungry.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:48.540] Oh,
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:48.780] I
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:48.980] see.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:49.620] Yeah,
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.140] so
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:50.460] that
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.140] makes
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:51.320] sense
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:51.420] in
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:51.480] a
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:51.760] logical
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:51.980] sense,
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.120] but
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:52.340] that's
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:52.440] not
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:52.620] how
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:52.780] it's
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.080] described
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:53.380] in
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:53.620] LPL.
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.000] There's
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.220] also
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:54.720] an
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.160] operator
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:55.580] that's
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:55.720] sort
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:55.760] of
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:55.880] like
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.240] unofficial
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:56.480] called
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:56.600] the
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:56.840] weak
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.100] until,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:57.960] and
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.140] that's
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:58.260] sort
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:58.280] of
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:58.460] saying
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:58.660] like
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:58.900] P
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.240] until
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:27:59.700] W,
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.340] or
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:00.920] always
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.220] P.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.060] So
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.220] that
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:02.380] kind
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:02.420] of
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:02.620] like
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:03.620] gets
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:03.780] rid
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:03.860] of
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:03.980] the
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.280] condition
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:04.480] that
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:04.580] it
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:04.800] reaches
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.080] W
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:05.220] at
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:05.380] some
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:05.580] point.
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.060] It
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:06.340] aligns
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:06.520] more
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:06.660] with
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:06.740] the
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:06.960] English.
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:07.640] Yeah,
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:07.940] yeah.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:08.500] But
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:08.660] just
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:08.880] the
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.120] until
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.480] operator
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:09.620] on
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:09.740] its
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:09.860] own
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.000] is
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.200] sort
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:10.280] of
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:10.400] like
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:10.520] a
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.000] strong
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.460] until.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.220] Yeah.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:12.420] So
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:12.580] that
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:12.800] adds
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:12.980] to
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:13.080] it.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:13.380] Yeah,
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:13.620] that's
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:13.780] fine.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.300] Okay.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.100] Yeah.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.060] Sometimes,
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:17.300] yeah,
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:17.420] I
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:17.540] get
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:17.880] confused
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.020] about
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:18.160] the
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.480] syntax
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:18.640] and
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:18.760] feel
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:18.920] like
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.160] why
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:19.300] I
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:19.380] didn't
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:19.760] necessarily
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.100] chose
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:20.260] the
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:20.280] same
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:20.480] thing.
[00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:21.750] Okay,
[00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:22.090] and
[00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:22.230] then
[00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.430] the
[00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.810] globally
[00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:23.610] one,
[00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:24.070] which
[00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.210] we
[00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:24.450] said,
[00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:24.710] this
[00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.830] is
[00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.930] the
[00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:24.990] one
[00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.070] that
[00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.170] you're
[00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:25.290] just
[00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:25.630] describing,
[00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:25.850] is
[00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.950] that
[00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:26.110] you
[00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.450] have
[00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.570] to
[00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.730] have
[00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:26.950] P
[00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:27.090] in
[00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:27.330] every
[00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:27.530] single
[00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:27.830] state
[00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.970] in
[00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:28.070] the
[00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.310] future.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:30.600] And
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:30.720] then
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:30.840] the
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.100] release
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:31.500] operator
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:32.560] is
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:32.680] you
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:32.900] have
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.020] to
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:33.200] have
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:33.600] P
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.200] until
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:34.340] you
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:34.540] have
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:34.880] W,
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:35.560] but
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:35.840] P
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:35.980] and
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.200] W
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.640] also
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:36.940] have
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.140] to
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:37.820] share
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:37.980] the
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:38.220] same
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:38.660] state
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.300] when
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:39.580] they
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.020] switch
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:40.720] from.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:41.920] So
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.140] it's
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:42.300] like,
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:42.640] it's
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.020] in
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:43.560] until,
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:44.700] we
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:44.840] don't
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:44.980] have
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:45.060] to
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:45.180] have
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:45.280] the
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:45.440] P
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:45.700] here,
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:46.280] but
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:46.660] with
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.200] release,
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:47.400] you
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:47.600] have
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:47.680] to
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:47.800] have
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:47.940] the
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:48.100] P
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:48.220] and
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:48.500] W
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.000] occur
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.120] in
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:49.220] the
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:49.400] same
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:49.800] state.
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:51.020] Next
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:51.260] one.
[00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:57.730] So
[00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:58.250] just
[00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.510] like
[00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:58.750] the
[00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:59.110] or
[00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.010] operator,
[00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:00.290] can
[00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:00.370] we
[00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:00.750] describe
[00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.990] using
[00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:01.190] a
[00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.550] not
[00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.070] and
[00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.370] an,
[00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:03.290] the
[00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:03.810] future
[00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:04.470] release
[00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.710] and
[00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.150] globally
[00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:05.890] operators
[00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:06.110] can
[00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.410] also
[00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:06.610] be
[00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:07.070] described
[00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.030] using
[00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:08.910] other,
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.360] using
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:11.620] other
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.020] temporal
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:12.560] operators.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.280] And
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:13.620] so
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.460] just
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:14.600] as
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:14.740] an
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.160] exercise,
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.220] can
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:16.460] any
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:16.600] of

[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:17.280] me
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:17.620] which,
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.020] these
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:18.120] are
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:18.300] not

[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:18.940] which
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:19.040] of

[00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.670] guys
[00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.310] thought
[00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.510] about
[00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.690] which
[00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:55.930] ones
[00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.150] might
[00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:56.490] relate
[00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:56.630] to
[00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.770] which
[00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:56.950] ones?
[00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.050] Does

[00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:01.610] Yeah.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:06.500] So,
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:06.980] let's
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:09.160] do
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:09.420] this
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:09.640] thing
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:09.900] again.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:10.880] So
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.600] true,
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:12.840] the
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.120] statement
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:13.620] true
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.680] says,
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:15.760] it
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:15.960] doesn't
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.140] say
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:16.420] anything
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:16.660] about
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:16.860] what
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.040] the
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:17.500] propositions
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:17.800] are.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.060] It's
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:18.340] just
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:18.740] something
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:18.980] that's
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:19.120] true
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.280] for
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:19.440] all
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:19.620] states,
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:19.820] right?
[00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:21.350] So
[00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.490] if
[00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:21.530] we're
[00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:21.750] saying
[00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:22.110] true
[00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.410] until
[00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:22.870] P,
[00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.710] that
[00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.870] means
[00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.990] that
[00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.110] you
[00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.250] can
[00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:24.550] have
[00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:24.830] whatever
[00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:25.130] you
[00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:25.490] want
[00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:26.150] until
[00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:26.530] P
[00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:26.910] occurs.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:28.680] So
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.020] does
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:29.140] that
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:29.300] make
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:29.500] sense?
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:29.680] That
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:29.840] at
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.060] some
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:30.260] point
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:30.380] in
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:30.500] the
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:30.800] future,
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:31.140] P
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:31.380] has
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:31.500] to
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:31.740] occur
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.980] exactly
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.500] because
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:33.700] we
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:33.900] had
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.160] the
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.660] strong
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:34.900] until,
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:35.680] right?
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:36.800] Does
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:36.860] that
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:36.980] make
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:37.140] sense,
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:37.320] everyone?
[00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.030] Yes,
[00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:39.150] I
[00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:39.270] see
[00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:39.410] some
[00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:39.550] hands
[00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:39.710] up,
[00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:39.990] cool.
[00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:40.790] All
[00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:40.930] right,
[00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:41.150] and
[00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:41.470] now
[00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.710] what
[00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.870] about
[00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:42.090] this
[00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:42.250] one?
[00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.410] We
[00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:42.630] have
[00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:43.650] not
[00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:44.230] F,
[00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:44.650] not
[00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:45.050] P.
[00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:46.810] So
[00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:47.230] this
[00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.350] is
[00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.530] saying
[00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:48.070] that,
[00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.790] at
[00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:53.210] some
[00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.510] point,
[00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:54.010] if
[00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:54.450] it's
[00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:54.490] not
[00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:54.610] in
[00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:54.710] the
[00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.950] case
[00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:55.110] that
[00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.250] at
[00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.430] some
[00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.690] point
[00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:55.870] in
[00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:56.030] the
[00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:56.370] future,
[00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:56.810] you
[00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:57.090] don't
[00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:57.310] have
[00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.590] P.
[00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.510] So
[00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:58.710] what
[00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.830] do
[00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.870] you
[00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.990] think
[00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.150] that
[00:31:59.150 --> 00:31:59.290] would
[00:31:59.290 --> 00:31:59.710] correspond
[00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.990] to?
[00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:00.990] If
[00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.130] at
[00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.370] some
[00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.590] point
[00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.750] in
[00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.870] the
[00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:02.090] future,
[00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.350] you
[00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.670] can't
[00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:02.850] have
[00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:02.990] the
[00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.350] situation
[00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.550] where
[00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:03.670] there's
[00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:03.830] not
[00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:04.270] P.
[00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.910] There's
[00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:04.970] no
[00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:05.210] P.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:05.680] There's
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:05.800] no
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:05.920] P,
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:06.480] right?
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:07.400] So
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:07.560] what's
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:07.700] that?
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:08.060] So
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:08.200] if
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.340] you
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:09.580] have
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:09.920] P
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.160] at
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:10.520] every
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:10.800] single
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.200] state,
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:11.940] then
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:12.620] you
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:12.920] never
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.140] have
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:13.280] the
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:13.900] situation
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:14.560] where
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:14.720] you
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:14.900] don't
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.060] have
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:15.300] P,
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:15.680] right?
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:16.920] And
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.100] so
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:17.260] that
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:17.440] leaves
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:17.600] this
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:17.800] last
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.040] one.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:18.680] We
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:18.940] have,
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:20.600] you
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:20.920] don't
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.100] have
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:21.240] a
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.660] scenario
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.160] where
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:22.300] you
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:22.660] have
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.720] not
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.100] P
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:24.400] until
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:24.800] not
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.400] W.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.460] So
[00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:30.370] if
[00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:30.950] you
[00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:31.150] have
[00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:31.610] not,
[00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:36.950] but
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.000] it's
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.100] just
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:41.420] important
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:41.600] to
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:41.800] remember
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.040] that
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:42.200] you
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:42.520] can
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.560] describe
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.740] operators
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.660] with
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.780] similar
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.100] terms
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:48.240] so
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:48.320] that
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:48.460] your
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:48.800] planner
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.200] doesn't
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:49.420] have
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:49.600] to
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:49.820] deal
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.000] with
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.180] it.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.060] The
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.500] global
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:51.900] operator,
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:52.100] the
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:52.300] release
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:52.540] operator,
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:52.700] the
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:52.920] event.
[00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.730] So
[00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:59.250] yeah,
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:32:59.740] you're
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:32:59.900] right,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.200] perfect.
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.000] And
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.120] then
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:02.300] this
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:02.400] is
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:02.560] just
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:02.700] a
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.020] recap
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:03.220] of
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:03.320] the
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.580] different
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.080] operators.
[00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.650] And
[00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:10.970] so
[00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:11.790] there's
[00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:11.990] a
[00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.130] few
[00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:12.290] more
[00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:12.490] really
[00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:12.670] cool
[00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:12.930] things
[00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:13.050] that
[00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:13.130] you
[00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.290] can
[00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:13.470] do
[00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.990] combining
[00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.290] these
[00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:14.570] different
[00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.910] operators.
[00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:16.110] And
[00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.250] the
[00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.570] first
[00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:16.970] is
[00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:17.690] that,
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:19.720] remember
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.000] when
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.360] Ben
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:20.840] was
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.840] describing
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.080] that
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:22.220] we
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:22.380] need
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:22.480] to
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:22.680] get
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.080] gas,
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:23.500] and
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:23.600] we
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:23.740] need
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:23.800] to
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:23.940] get
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.080] it
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.180] in
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:24.260] the
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:24.540] future,
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.320] but
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:25.600] even
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:25.840] after
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.060] we
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:26.200] get
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:26.500] gas,
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:26.700] we're
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:26.760] gonna
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:26.920] have
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.040] to
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:27.180] get
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:27.260] it
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:27.700] again
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.060] sometime
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:28.260] in
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:28.380] the
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:28.660] future.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.040] So
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:31.340] it's
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:31.660] important
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:31.860] that
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:31.980] we
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.120] can
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:32.440] describe
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:32.700] something
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:32.840] that
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.120] happens
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:33.580] infinitely
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.060] often.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.340] And
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:35.920] the
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.060] way
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:36.160] that
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:36.240] we
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:36.540] describe
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:36.740] that
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:36.960] is
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.120] saying
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:37.260] that
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:37.400] we
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.420] always
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:38.920] have
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.300] the
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.700] scenario
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.260] where
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.560] you
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:41.780] will
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.220] eventually
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:42.600] reach
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:42.980] P.
[00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:45.150] So
[00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:46.310] does
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:49.680] that
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:49.820] make
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.040] sense
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.280] that
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:50.480] like,
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:51.460] at
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:51.700] right
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:51.940] now
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:52.040] in
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:52.140] the
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:52.380] future,
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:52.760] I'm
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:52.880] gonna
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.100] get
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:53.480] gas.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:54.000] And
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.200] even
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:54.480] after
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:54.640] I
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:54.740] get
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:54.920] that
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.260] gas,
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.100] I
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:56.260] will
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:56.660] eventually
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:56.840] in
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:56.940] the
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:57.160] future
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:57.740] also
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:57.980] need
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.080] to
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:58.200] get
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:58.440] gas
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:58.800] again,
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:33:59.300] because
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:33:59.460] your
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:33:59.760] car
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:33:59.920] will
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.160] always
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:00.300] be
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:00.480] needing
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:00.640] to
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:00.760] get
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.100] gas.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:02.320] Does
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:02.320] that
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:02.460] make
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:02.600] sense?
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:04.860] Cool.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:05.680] And
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:05.880] then
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.520] eventually,
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.360] forever,
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:07.980] is
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.220] another
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:08.560] scenario
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:08.800] that's
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.140] important
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:09.400] to
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:09.780] describe.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.460] So
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:11.940] let's
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:12.100] say
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:12.240] that
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:12.380] the
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:12.620] traffic
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:12.800] light
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:12.980] will
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.340] eventually
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:13.660] turn
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:13.920] green
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.280] forever.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.400] We
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:15.600] need
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:15.700] to
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:15.820] be
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.000] able
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.180] to
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:16.420] say
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:16.780] that
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.020] at
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:17.180] some
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:17.340] point
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:17.460] in
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:17.540] the
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:17.780] future,
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:18.080] although
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:18.280] we
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.500] don't
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:18.700] know
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.040] when,
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:19.380] the
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:19.660] traffic
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:19.920] light
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.160] will
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:20.380] turn
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:20.660] green.
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:21.240] So
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.580] the
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.020] future
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:23.840] operator
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.640] says
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.000] that
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.140] at
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:25.300] some
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:25.500] point
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:25.640] in
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:25.780] the
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.200] future,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:27.180] you
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:27.320] will
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:27.520] have
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:27.820] something
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.020] come
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:28.220] true.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:29.340] And
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:29.500] so
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:29.780] at
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.000] this
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.400] state,
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:31.360] P
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:31.760] becomes
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.140] true,
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.080] but
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:33.280] the
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:33.660] global
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.140] operator
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:34.460] says
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:34.700] that
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.100] happens
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:35.680] from
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:35.940] this
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:36.300] state
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.080] forever
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:37.720] afterwards,
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.800] which
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:38.980] is
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:39.680] saying
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.400] that
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:40.600] you
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.040] eventually
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:41.400] have,
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:42.800] eventually,
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.240] we'll
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:43.640] always
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:43.820] have
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.020] this
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:44.240] state,
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:44.560] P,
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.060] be
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:45.220] true.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:49.620] Do
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:49.620] you
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:49.760] guys
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:49.860] have
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.020] any
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.280] questions
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.520] on
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:50.720] that?
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.020] Did
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.140] I
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:51.380] say
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:51.580] that
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:51.760] correctly?
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:52.480] It
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:52.680] seems
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:52.940] weird
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.060] to
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:53.180] me
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:53.320] that
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:53.500] the
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:53.820] gas
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.060] thing
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.280] is
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:54.680] becoming
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.080] this
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.500] like
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.080] occasional
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:56.420] temporal
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:56.820] operator
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.180] instead
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:57.360] of
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:57.560] just
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:57.760] like
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.020] the
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:58.280] state
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:58.460] that
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:58.560] we
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:58.980] actually
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:59.400] have
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:34:59.800] gas,
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.140] which
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:00.320] is
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:00.500] the
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.000] illogical
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.300] thing
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:01.560] that
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.160] is
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:02.420] actually
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:02.700] true.
[00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:05.210] Oh,
[00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:05.510] yeah.
[00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.930] Why
[00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:06.090] is
[00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:06.250] the
[00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:06.550] act
[00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.730] of
[00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:06.930] getting
[00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:07.470] gas,
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:10.780] just
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.020] we
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.280] always
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:11.440] need
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:11.600] some
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:11.900] quantity?
[00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.010] That's
[00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.150] true.
[00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.350] We
[00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:13.510] do
[00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.730] always
[00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:13.870] need
[00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:14.030] some
[00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.330] quantity
[00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:14.550] of
[00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.750] gas.
[00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.970] And
[00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:15.110] you
[00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:15.270] would
[00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.570] describe
[00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:15.770] it,
[00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.370] like
[00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.490] you
[00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.610] said,
[00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.770] just
[00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:16.890] with
[00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:17.010] the
[00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:17.250] always
[00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:17.570] operator.
[00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.250] But
[00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:18.410] I
[00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.630] guess
[00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.950] my
[00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:19.310] action
[00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.450] of
[00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:19.590] getting
[00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:19.850] gas
[00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:19.990] is
[00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.150] I'm
[00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.330] thinking
[00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:20.490] of
[00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:20.730] actually
[00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:21.170] driving
[00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.430] up
[00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.590] to
[00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:21.730] the
[00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:21.970] gas
[00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:22.290] station
[00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:22.510] and
[00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.170] filling
[00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.370] it
[00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:24.550] up
[00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.690] with
[00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:24.910] gas.
[00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:25.050] And
[00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:25.550] if
[00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.650] you
[00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:26.170] didn't
[00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:26.370] do
[00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:26.690] that,
[00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.330] you
[00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.130] wouldn't
[00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:29.910] be
[00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:30.090] able
[00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:30.330] to
[00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:30.890] always
[00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:31.130] have
[00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.490] gas.
[00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:32.410] Does
[00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:32.510] that
[00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.630] make
[00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.790] sense?
[00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.990] Right,
[00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:34.170] so
[00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:34.790] I
[00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.950] would
[00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:35.170] think
[00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:35.410] that
[00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:35.830] always
[00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:36.030] have
[00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.310] gas
[00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.530] would
[00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.750] make
[00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:36.950] that
[00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:37.190] call.
[00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:38.390] Yeah,
[00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:40.070] and
[00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:40.310] depending
[00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.450] on
[00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:40.550] how
[00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.630] you
[00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.770] make
[00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:40.890] your
[00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:41.130] model,
[00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.250] that
[00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:41.330] you
[00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:41.630] definitely
[00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.870] could
[00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:42.050] do
[00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.290] that.
[00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:42.570] And
[00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:42.710] that
[00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.970] definitely
[00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:43.230] would
[00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.710] satisfy
[00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.890] the
[00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:44.190] condition.
[00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.670] But
[00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.870] this
[00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:45.010] is
[00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:45.170] the
[00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.470] usual
[00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.650] way
[00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.770] to
[00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.930] deal
[00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:46.070] with
[00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:46.210] it?
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:48.060] Well,
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:48.240] it
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:48.580] depends
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:48.720] on
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:48.900] the
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:49.400] situation.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:49.820] Maybe
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.320] you
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:51.600] would
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:51.860] instead
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:52.120] wanna
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:52.620] say
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:53.800] at
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.000] some
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.140] point
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:54.240] in
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:54.320] the
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:54.560] future,
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.000] the
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.800] light
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:55.960] will
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.240] always
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:56.420] be
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:56.760] green
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.060] because
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:57.160] you
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.360] wanted
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:57.500] to
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:57.600] make
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:57.600] sure
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:57.700] that
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.000] cars
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:58.180] can
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:58.300] go
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:58.480] through.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:58.660] And
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:58.820] even
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:35:58.920] if
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.080] it's
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:35:59.200] with
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:35:59.540] red,
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.000] at
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.160] some
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:00.360] point
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:00.500] it
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:00.600] will
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:00.740] be
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:00.940] green
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.060] in
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:01.160] the
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:01.460] future.
[00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:02.370] So
[00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:02.530] it
[00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:02.710] really
[00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.990] depends
[00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.110] on
[00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:03.210] your
[00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:03.470] model
[00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.590] and
[00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:03.750] how
[00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.030] I
[00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.310] think
[00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.230] the
[00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.390] way
[00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.530] you're
[00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:05.770] saying
[00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:05.890] it,
[00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:06.030] where
[00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.130] you
[00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:06.390] always
[00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.570] wanna
[00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:06.810] have
[00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:07.250] gas
[00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.650] and
[00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:09.150] the
[00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.890] proposition
[00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:10.450] gas
[00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.590] is
[00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:12.770] how
[00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.930] much
[00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:13.110] gas
[00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:13.210] you
[00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:13.310] have
[00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.390] in
[00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.490] your
[00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:13.730] tank.
[00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:13.830] And
[00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:13.930] if
[00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:14.010] you
[00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:14.230] have
[00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.330] it
[00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:14.450] or
[00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.710] don't,
[00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.950] then
[00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.070] I
[00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:15.230] think
[00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.370] that
[00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:15.510] that
[00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.610] would
[00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:15.710] be
[00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.810] a
[00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:15.850] really
[00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:16.090] good
[00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:16.190] way
[00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.310] to
[00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.430] model
[00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.630] it
[00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.790] too.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:17.420] This,
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:17.720] I
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:17.840] mean,
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:17.960] if
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.040] you
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:18.320] said
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.600] I
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:18.760] have
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:18.880] to
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.000] get
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.300] gas,
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:19.440] I
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:19.680] plan
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:19.800] it
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:19.920] for
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.120] next
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:20.380] week,
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:20.540] and
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:20.640] I
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:20.760] run
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:20.900] out
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.000] of
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.200] gas
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:21.440] next
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:21.660] week,
[00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.410] you
[00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.610] have
[00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:24.770] to
[00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.110] somehow
[00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:25.370] be
[00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.650] tracking
[00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:25.870] the
[00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:26.070] economy
[00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:26.230] of
[00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.490] gas
[00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:26.630] also.
[00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.930] Yeah,
[00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:27.070] I
[00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:27.310] agree,
[00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.610] I
[00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:27.770] agree.
[00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:28.050] I
[00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:28.230] was
[00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.350] just
[00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:28.590] using
[00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:28.710] it
[00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.830] as
[00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:28.930] an
[00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:29.210] example
[00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.410] to
[00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:29.890] explain
[00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:30.250] the
[00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:30.650] concept,
[00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:31.270] but
[00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.770] I
[00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.030] agree
[00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.190] that
[00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.330] that
[00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:32.530] definitely
[00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:32.810] probably
[00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.990] would
[00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.010] be
[00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:33.110] a
[00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:33.250] better
[00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:33.390] way
[00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.470] to
[00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.650] model
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.060] it.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:34.660] I
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:34.860] think
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.360] in
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:35.600] both
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:35.860] cases
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.020] it
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:36.180] works.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:36.400] If
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:36.420] you
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:36.820] represent
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.160] this
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:37.300] as
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:37.640] having
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.360] gas
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:38.580] all
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:38.660] the
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:38.940] time
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:39.880] or
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.260] explicitly
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:40.660] saying
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:40.980] that
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:41.340] you're
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:41.460] gonna
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.000] be
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.160] in
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:42.240] a
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:42.480] gas
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:42.940] station
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.380] and
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:44.760] eventually
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.560] it's
[00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:46.470] always
[00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.750] been
[00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:47.010] found.
[00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.610] That
[00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:48.910] depends
[00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:49.050] on
[00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:49.270] how,
[00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:49.670] maybe
[00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.850] you
[00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:50.030] wanna
[00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.910] always
[00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:51.390] have
[00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.490] a
[00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:51.710] gas
[00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:52.070] from
[00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:52.310] a
[00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.750] station
[00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:53.690] as
[00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.910] opposed
[00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:54.030] to
[00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.250] getting
[00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:54.390] a
[00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.570] gas
[00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:54.770] from
[00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:55.110] elsewhere.
[00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:55.390] So
[00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.570] it
[00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:56.170] depends
[00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:56.410] on
[00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:56.750] what
[00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:57.250] you
[00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:57.490] want
[00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:57.650] to
[00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.830] model,
[00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.210] but
[00:36:58.210 --> 00:36:58.710] I
[00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.890] think
[00:36:58.890 --> 00:36:59.290] both
[00:36:59.290 --> 00:36:59.810] will
[00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:00.030] work.
[00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:04.230] So
[00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.670] infinite
[00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:05.070] often,
[00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.630] it
[00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.870] doesn't
[00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:06.090] really
[00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:06.350] care
[00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:06.470] as
[00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.630] far
[00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.790] as
[00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:07.230] how
[00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.590] frequently
[00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.030] it
[00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.130] is.
[00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.630] Yeah,
[00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.750] it
[00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.930] doesn't
[00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:09.110] care
[00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:09.250] how
[00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:09.530] frequently.
[00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:09.930] But
[00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:10.150] what
[00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.310] about
[00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.490] this
[00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:10.610] is,
[00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:11.050] for
[00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:11.310] instance,
[00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:11.890] something
[00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:12.130] I
[00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:12.310] haven't
[00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.450] had
[00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:12.650] in
[00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.650] every
[00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.930] 60
[00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.410] years.
[00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:14.250] My
[00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:14.470] system
[00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.830] lifetime
[00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:15.050] is
[00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.210] over
[00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:15.610] 30
[00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:15.990] years.
[00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:16.410] So
[00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:16.530] what
[00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:16.610] should
[00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:16.730] be
[00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:16.970] something
[00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:17.150] that
[00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.250] happened
[00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:17.510] only
[00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.930] once?
[00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:18.350] So
[00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:18.470] in
[00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.690] this
[00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:19.030] case,
[00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:19.590] infinite
[00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:19.930] often,
[00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:20.690] and
[00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:21.210] have
[00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:21.350] it
[00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:21.510] in
[00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.770] future,
[00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:22.010] the
[00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.190] future
[00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.430] operator
[00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.670] could
[00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.790] be
[00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.930] the
[00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:23.190] same,
[00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:23.470] right?
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:26.480] So
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:26.820] for
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.020] instance,
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.080] something
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:28.380] happened
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:28.620] every
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:28.940] 60
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:29.420] years.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.080] My
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.280] system
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:30.680] lifetime
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:30.940] goes
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:31.060] to
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:31.280] 30
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:31.500] years.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:31.700] After
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:31.960] 30
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:32.120] years,
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:32.240] I
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:32.320] have
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:32.380] to
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:32.500] get
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:32.680] rid
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:32.840] of
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:32.980] the
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:33.240] system.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:34.380] And
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:34.600] then,
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:34.860] so
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.140] during
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:35.380] this
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:35.620] period
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:35.800] of
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.000] time,
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:36.580] maybe
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:36.800] only
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.100] one
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:37.300] thing
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:37.780] happens.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:38.100] So
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:38.240] it
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:38.420] happens
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:38.840] often
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.180] to
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:39.740] infinity,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.080] but
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:40.280] in
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:40.460] the
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:40.780] lifetime
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.060] of
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.140] the
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:41.300] system,
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:41.500] it
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:41.580] only
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:41.780] happens
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.180] once.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.020] And
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:43.380] therefore,
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:43.860] in
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.080] this
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:44.580] condition,
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:45.100] the
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:45.360] infinite
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:45.900] often
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.720] should
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:46.960] be
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.300] exactly
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:47.500] the
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:47.680] same
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:47.860] as
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:48.020] the
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:48.460] future,
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:48.820] right?
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.380] Current
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:49.680] state,
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:49.960] something
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.320] happened
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:50.500] in
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:50.580] the
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:50.780] future.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:51.040] I
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:51.040] would
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:51.140] say
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:51.300] something
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:51.480] that
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:51.660] never
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:51.920] happened
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.240] again.
[00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:54.370] Kind
[00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:54.610] of.
[00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.490] So
[00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:56.030] when
[00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.150] you're
[00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.290] talking
[00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:56.430] about
[00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.550] a
[00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.730] system
[00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.030] that's
[00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.510] dying
[00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.870] after
[00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:58.170] 30
[00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:58.590] years,
[00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:00.330] the
[00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:00.910] LTO
[00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:01.410] doesn't
[00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:01.770] actually
[00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:02.170] model
[00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:02.490] something
[00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:02.670] that
[00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:03.150] ends.
[00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.390] It
[00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.510] would
[00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.750] model
[00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:04.070] something
[00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:04.290] to
[00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:04.710] infinity,
[00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.210] although
[00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.430] there
[00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.610] is
[00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:05.710] an
[00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:06.090] extension
[00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:06.290] to
[00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:06.590] LTO
[00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:06.830] that
[00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:07.230] can
[00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.090] incorporate
[00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:08.550] that
[00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.950] into
[00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:09.130] it,
[00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:09.490] having
[00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:09.830] it
[00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.750] have
[00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.930] an
[00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:12.230] actual
[00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.490] end
[00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:12.770] goal
[00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:13.030] state.
[00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.610] And
[00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:13.710] I
[00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.870] think
[00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:14.050] in
[00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:14.250] that
[00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:14.510] case,
[00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.890] then
[00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:15.910] infinitely
[00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:16.270] often
[00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.610] would
[00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:16.890] be
[00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:17.590] different
[00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.050] and
[00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.330] would,
[00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:19.430] I
[00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.990] don't
[00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.450] know
[00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:20.770] exactly
[00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:20.970] how
[00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:21.070] that
[00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:21.250] would
[00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:21.710] apply
[00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.770] in
[00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.850] that
[00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:22.190] situation.
[00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.370] Do
[00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.410] you
[00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:22.570] know,
[00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:22.750] Ben?
[00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.970] I
[00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:23.050] know
[00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:23.150] you
[00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.270] would
[00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.510] kind
[00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.650] of.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:26.340] Well,
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:26.600] there's
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:26.920] something
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.120] called
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:27.380] metric
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:27.700] temporal
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.060] logic,
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:28.340] which
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:28.940] associates
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:29.320] like
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:29.780] a
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:30.240] time
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.580] scale
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:30.760] with
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:30.880] each
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:30.940] of
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.060] these
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:31.480] operators.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.120] So
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:32.220] I
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:32.320] think
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:32.500] you'd
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:32.580] have
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:32.680] to
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:32.820] use
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.040] that
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:33.220] if
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:33.340] you
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:33.600] were
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:33.840] trying
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.080] to
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:34.580] express
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:34.820] that
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:34.960] you
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.480] had
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:35.780] to
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.400] always
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:36.620] meet
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:36.780] this
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:37.080] condition
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:37.440] still
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:37.660] within
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:37.820] your
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:38.160] lifetime.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:38.380] You
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:38.520] could
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:38.800] have
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.800] some
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:40.480] sort
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:40.580] of
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.100] qualifier
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.240] for
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:41.360] these
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:41.720] operators
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:41.900] that
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:42.240] specify
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:42.420] an
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:42.600] action
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:42.780] in
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.080] time
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.260] where
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:44.420] that
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:44.700] operator
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:44.880] might
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.140] feature.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:45.940] So
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.100] which
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:46.260] would
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:46.400] be
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:46.660] probably
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.040] used
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.200] just
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:47.880] often
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.260] in
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:48.360] some
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:48.600] public
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:48.960] scenarios,
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:49.440] something
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:49.900] a
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.120] little
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:50.240] bit
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:50.440] more
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:50.820] frequent
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:51.440] during
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:51.580] a
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:51.820] system
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.340] lifetime,
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.040] right?
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:53.260] Not
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:53.460] as
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:53.840] something,
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.000] you
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:54.260] know,
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:54.660] having
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:54.800] a
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.260] hybrid
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:55.620] years
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:55.780] or
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:55.880] two
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:55.980] or
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:56.100] three
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:56.420] years.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:56.780] Yeah,
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:57.660] you
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:57.740] know,
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:57.940] it's
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:58.200] important
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:58.340] that
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:58.720] LTO
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.380] is
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:38:59.520] only
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:38:59.780] dealing,
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.020] or
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:00.160] the
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:00.340] LTO
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:00.520] we're
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:00.800] explaining
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.040] here
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:01.140] is
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:01.280] only
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:01.500] dealing
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:01.680] with
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:01.940] infinite
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.360] states.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:02.980] So
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:03.400] I
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.660] agree,
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:03.840] it's
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:03.940] a
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.020] little
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:04.300] bit,
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:04.860] you
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:04.960] have
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.040] to
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:05.200] think
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.380] about
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:05.560] that
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:05.960] process
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.120] of
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:06.260] how
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:06.360] do
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:06.400] you
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:06.740] apply
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.040] something
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:07.300] that
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:07.880] goes
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.060] on
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:08.340] forever
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:08.540] to
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:08.660] a
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:08.820] real
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.200] system
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:09.540] that
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:09.720] obviously
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.020] doesn't
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:10.140] go
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:10.260] on
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:10.500] forever.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:10.880] Well,
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:10.980] there
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.180] has
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:11.300] to
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:11.400] be
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:11.520] a
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:11.740] way
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:11.980] to,
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:12.360] I
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:12.440] mean,
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:12.600] the
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:12.880] future
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.180] thing,
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:13.380] like
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:13.520] if
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:13.840] he
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.000] has
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.120] a

[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:14.480] that
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:14.700] lasts
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:14.920] 30
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.160] years
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:15.280] and

[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:18.700] system
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:18.840] is
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.020] gonna
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:19.440] say
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:19.820] that
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:20.320] the
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:20.700] constraint
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:20.860] on

[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.300] P
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:21.440] is
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:21.540] that
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:21.680] it
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:21.820] has
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:21.960] to
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.140] happen
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:22.360] within
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:22.660] 30
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:22.960] years,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:23.140] right?
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:23.500] Because
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:23.660] like
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.060] future
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:24.740] P
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.000] here
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:25.180] for
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:25.360] getting
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:25.780] gas
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.420] has
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:26.520] to
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:26.720] happen
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.080] before
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:27.200] I
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:27.340] run
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:27.480] out
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:27.580] of
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:27.820] gas.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.000] It's
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.160] not
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:28.500] just,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:29.180] this
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:29.660] representation
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.040] says
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:30.140] it
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:30.300] just
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.500] happens
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:30.660] in
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:30.740] the
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:30.960] future,
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:31.200] but
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:31.940] somewhere
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.280] in
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:32.620] your,
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:33.300] you
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:33.380] know,
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:33.820] constraint
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.200] checking,
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:34.440] it's
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:34.560] gonna
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:34.880] say,
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:35.180] hey,
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:35.320] we
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:35.520] didn't
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:35.760] get
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.060] gas
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:36.180] in
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:36.320] this
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:36.540] plant
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:36.800] soon
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.060] enough,
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:37.280] right?
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:37.880] Yeah.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:38.900] Yeah,
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:39.200] that's
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:39.460] definitely
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:39.680] true.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.120] And
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:40.320] these
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:40.460] are
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.420] just
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.900] tools
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.060] to
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.220] help
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:43.320] you
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:43.540] model
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:43.720] it,
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:43.900] but
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.620] it's
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:44.940] definitely
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:45.140] not
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:45.340] the
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:45.580] entire
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:45.960] model
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.120] of
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:46.200] your
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:46.560] system,
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.220] obviously.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:47.860] And
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.080] so
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:48.420] I
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:48.660] agree
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:48.840] that
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.080] we
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:49.400] definitely
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:49.600] would
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:49.780] have
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:49.900] to
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.180] incorporate
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:50.360] that
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:50.580] in.
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:50.820] And
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.040] for
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:51.340] finite
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:51.880] systems,
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:53.140] you'll
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:53.320] have
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.500] to
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:53.860] account
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.040] for
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:54.200] that.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:54.360] And
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:54.700] that's
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:54.800] why
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:54.940] they
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:55.140] have
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:55.280] the
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:55.640] extension
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:55.960] of

[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:56.480] to
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:56.780] finite
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.200] systems,
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:58.660] which
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:58.840] we
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:58.960] can
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.340] certainly
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:39:59.740] send
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:39:59.880] out
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.080] a
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:00.260] link
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:00.960] of

[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:01.520] papers
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:01.880] and
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.180] forward
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:02.360] out
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:02.460] the

[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:06.940] Yeah,
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:07.220] I
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:07.520] think
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:07.980] you
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.160] guys
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:08.240] have
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:08.340] done
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:08.440] a
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:08.540] very
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:08.700] good
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:08.880] job
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:08.980] of
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.260] answering
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.060] the
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.340] questions.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:10.760] The
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.180] three
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:11.980] extensions
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.220] to
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:12.600] LPL
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:12.820] that
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.100] I've
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:13.340] found
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:13.480] to
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:13.600] be
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:13.700] the

[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:14.760] of
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:14.900] things
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.040] that
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:15.240] we're
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:15.560] doing
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:15.980] is
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.180] metric
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:17.500] temporal
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:17.760] logic,
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:17.980] which
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.080] is
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:18.200] the
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:18.360] first
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:18.500] one
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:18.600] that
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:18.720] you
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:18.980] mentioned.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:19.700] Also
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:19.860] to
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:20.000] be
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.120] able
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:20.220] to
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:20.420] have
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:20.520] an

[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:21.320] time,
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:21.500] which
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:21.620] is
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:21.900] related,
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.100] you
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:22.380] mentioned.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:22.640] And
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:22.740] then
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:22.840] the
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.080] last
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:23.380] one
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.180] is
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:24.380] to
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:24.520] deal
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:24.680] with
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:25.160] uncertainty
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:25.360] and
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:25.440] is
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:25.620] then
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:25.940] a
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:26.400] probabilistic
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:26.640] linear
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:26.940] temporal
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:27.300] logic.
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:28.300] Okay,
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:28.840] cool.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:32.860] I
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.260] mentioned
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:33.440] that
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:33.580] this
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:33.720] is
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:33.880] two
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.120] separate
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:36.180] things.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.240] What
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:37.320] are
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:37.560] some
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:37.700] of
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:37.820] your
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:38.160] statements
[00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.910] of
[00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:39.210] LPL
[00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.870] that
[00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.990] you
[00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.270] guys
[00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.690] can
[00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:41.250] tell
[00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:41.430] me,
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:43.080] and
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:43.400] explain
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:43.740] why,
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.000] if
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.100] you
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:44.280] look
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:44.420] at
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:44.560] it.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:50.520] Okay,
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:50.820] so
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:51.080] why
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:51.300] is
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:51.600] the
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:51.800] next
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.100] red
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:52.600] true?
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.040] Next
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:55.240] step
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:55.400] is
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:55.600] still
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:55.800] red.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.280] Yep,
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:56.600] exactly,
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:56.800] because
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:56.880] the
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.020] next
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:57.120] one
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:57.240] is
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:57.420] red.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:58.280] Why
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:58.440] is
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:58.520] it
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:58.660] true
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:58.820] that
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:40:58.920] in
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.020] the
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:40:59.260] future,
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:40:59.480] there's
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:40:59.680] green?
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:01.860] Yep,
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.200] true
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:02.320] that
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:02.440] in
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:02.460] the
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:02.660] future,
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:02.880] there's
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:03.120] green.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.040] And
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:04.240] why
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:04.400] is
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:04.540] it
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:04.700] true
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:04.820] that
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.020] there's
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:05.180] red
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:05.360] until
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:05.640] green?
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:10.500] So
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:10.840] it
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:11.020] makes
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.260] sense
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:11.400] that
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:11.520] if
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:11.680] all
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:11.760] of
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:11.900] these
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:12.040] are
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:12.320] true,
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:12.920] that
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.280] this
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.020] combination
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:14.780] of
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.200] the
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:15.720] antecedents
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:15.980] between
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:16.160] all
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:16.280] of
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:16.480] them
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:16.800] is
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:16.980] also
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.160] true,
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:17.340] right?
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:17.780] And
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:17.880] so
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:17.980] you
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:18.080] can
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:18.200] do
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:18.320] that
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:18.520] with
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:18.820] OR
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:19.440] as
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:23.180] well.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:23.460] Behind
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:23.680] here,
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:24.220] you
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:24.340] could
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:24.980] have
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.200] a
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:25.460] future
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:25.800] around
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:25.960] this
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.120] whole
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:26.420] thing
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:26.860] and
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.020] it
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:27.140] would
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:27.360] be
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:27.500] true
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:27.700] that
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:27.900] at
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.040] some
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:28.180] point
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:28.280] in
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:28.380] the
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:28.660] future,
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.060] all
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:29.160] of
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:29.300] this
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:29.420] would
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:29.660] hold.
[00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.390] Does
[00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.470] that
[00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.590] make
[00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:30.730] sense?
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:33.800] What
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:33.940] do
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:33.960] you
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.080] mean,
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.240] right
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:34.500] there
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:34.780] is
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:34.940] true,
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.180] right?
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:35.500] That's
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:35.600] the
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:35.860] next
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:36.180] step.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.640] Yeah.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:37.780] Yep,
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.180] exactly.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:38.820] I
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:38.920] was
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.040] just
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.160] saying
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:39.280] if
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:39.380] you
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:39.580] had
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:39.840] more
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:39.980] of
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.020] the
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:40.760] antecedents,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:41.340] that's
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:41.420] what
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:41.500] you
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:41.620] were
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.000] considering
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.340] from
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:42.680] the
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.020] previous.
[00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:44.810] All
[00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:44.930] right,
[00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.110] so
[00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:45.410] now,
[00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.970] Navi's
[00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:46.090] gonna
[00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:46.410] talk
[00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:46.690] about
[00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:47.550] expressing
[00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:48.050] LPL
[00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.570] in
[00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:49.290] PDDL3.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.240] So
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:58.600] Ben
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.120] and
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.200] Ellie
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.720] has
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.760] guided
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:01.980] you
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.140] through
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:02.360] how
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.560] expressive
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.140] LPL
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:04.900] formulation
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:05.340] is.
[00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:06.380] I'm
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:06.560] going
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.100] to
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.220] formulate
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.120] the
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:09.900] LTL
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.260] in
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:10.900] a
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.240] classical
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:11.680] planner
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.040] like
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:12.760] PDDL.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.560] Now,
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:13.820] I'm
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:14.160] using
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:14.900] PDDL3,
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:15.240] which
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:15.420] is
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:15.600] an
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.120] extension,
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:16.620] proposed
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.140] extension
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:17.400] of
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.080] PDDL2
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:18.680].2,
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:19.780] which
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.280] supports
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:20.880] some
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.320] of
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:22.720] the
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.080] LTL
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:24.540] operators.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.140] So
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.340] these
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:27.520] are
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:27.640] the
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:27.920] basic
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.420] operators
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.060] that
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:29.220] you
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:29.800] can
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.080] use
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:30.300] to
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:30.760] express
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.060] the
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:31.740] constraints
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.100] and
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:32.580] goals
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.180] of
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:33.600] your
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:33.960] plan.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:34.760] So
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:34.940] you
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:35.320] have
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:35.680] at
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.020] A,
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:36.880] always,
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:37.620] sometimes,
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.180] within,
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:38.440] at
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:38.640] most,
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:39.000] once,
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:39.580] sometime
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:39.980] after,
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:40.780] sometime
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.320] before,
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:42.720] always,
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.220] within,
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:43.600] and
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:43.900] holding,
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:44.340] during.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:45.140] So
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:45.380] the
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:45.720] num
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.680] here
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:46.960] is
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.480] the
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.060] numeric
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:48.680] controls
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.040] that
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:49.180] you
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:49.300] can
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:49.860] specify,
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.100] and
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:51.480] these
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.140] are
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:52.460] the
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:52.960] ellipses
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.640] represents
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.740] already
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:55.620] existing
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.720] predicate,
[00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:58.110] goal
[00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.470] description
[00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:00.110] predicates.
[00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:00.710] So
[00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.830] some
[00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:01.970] of
[00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:02.150] the
[00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.830] operators
[00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:03.150] may
[00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:04.630] look
[00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:05.070] familiar
[00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:05.350] to
[00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:05.510] you
[00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.810] because
[00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:06.090] they
[00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:06.310] can
[00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:06.670] also
[00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.930] be
[00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:07.150] used
[00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.330] to
[00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:07.830] express
[00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:08.270] the
[00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.730] constraint
[00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:08.910] in
[00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:09.430] STN,
[00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:09.650] the
[00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.990] Simple
[00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.430] Temporal
[00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.830] Network
[00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:11.270] that
[00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.390] we
[00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.690] learned
[00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.850] in
[00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:12.170] class,
[00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:13.450] and
[00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:14.570] there
[00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:14.770] are
[00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:15.050] some
[00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.530] operators
[00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.750] that
[00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.890] are
[00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:16.170] unique
[00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:16.710] to
[00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:17.450] the
[00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:18.430] LTL
[00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.710] or
[00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:19.070] other
[00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:19.430] kinds,
[00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:19.830] like
[00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:20.490] matrix
[00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:21.270] temporal
[00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.590] network,
[00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:21.790] like
[00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:22.330] always,
[00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:22.990] for
[00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.330] example.
[00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.330] So
[00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:25.670] now
[00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.990] we
[00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.190] are
[00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.470] going
[00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.710] to
[00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:27.070] take
[00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:27.210] a
[00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:27.390] look
[00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.810] at
[00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.090] how
[00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:31.550] you
[00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.810] can
[00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:32.510] express
[00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:33.510] the
[00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.510] operators
[00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:35.050] using
[00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.350] PDDL3
[00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.530] language.
[00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.270] So
[00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.890] we
[00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:41.070] can
[00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:41.350] use
[00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:41.850] within
[00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:42.230] one
[00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.710] occurrence
[00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:43.130] to
[00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.450] model
[00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:43.710] next
[00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:44.470] because
[00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.750] there
[00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.890] is
[00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:45.370] no
[00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:46.030] explicit
[00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.370] next
[00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:46.610] in
[00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:46.830] the
[00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:47.490] PDDL3,
[00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:48.530] and
[00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.650] you
[00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:48.790] can
[00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:49.890] use
[00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:50.210] always
[00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:50.630] until
[00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.870] to
[00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:51.230] express
[00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.850] until,
[00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:53.050] and
[00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:53.470] in
[00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.590] the
[00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:53.910] future,
[00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:54.250] you
[00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:54.530] use
[00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:55.150] sometimes
[00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.550] after,
[00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.670] and
[00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:57.670] globally,
[00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:57.870] you
[00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.990] can
[00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.150] use
[00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.430] always.
[00:43:59.330 --> 00:43:59.430] And
[00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.650] for
[00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:00.070] least,
[00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:00.970] since
[00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:01.130] it
[00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:01.330] can
[00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:01.750] always
[00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:02.230] be
[00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.310] omega
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.100] or
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.300] always
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:06.980] until
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.040] omega
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.860] when
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:09.060] you
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:09.660] see
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:09.980] P,
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:10.600] you
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:10.760] can
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.040] use
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:11.560] all
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:11.960] plus
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.220] to
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:12.440] model
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:12.760] this
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.220] least.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.180] Okay,
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:18.460] let's
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:18.580] see
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:18.780] some
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.200] example.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:20.220] So
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:20.520] if
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:20.660] you
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.140] want
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:22.360] to,
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:22.740] if
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:22.880] your
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.180] goal
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:23.460] is
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:23.640] to
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.080] have
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.040] the
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.500] traffic
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:25.720] light
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.000] turn
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:26.260] red
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:26.440] in
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:26.560] the
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:26.780] next
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.180] state,
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.440] you
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:28.700] would
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:29.060] want
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:29.480] to
[00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:33.150] formulate
[00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.470] it
[00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.850] using
[00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:34.870] within
[00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:35.170] one
[00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:35.670] occurrence,
[00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.590] it
[00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:36.730] would,
[00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:37.090] the
[00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:37.430] traffic
[00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.630] light
[00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.770] would
[00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:37.950] turn
[00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:38.190] red.
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:41.960] And
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:42.240] let's
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:42.440] take
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:42.520] a
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:42.620] look
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:42.720] at
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:42.840] a
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.140] more
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.040] complicated
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:44.840] example.
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:45.540] So
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:45.860] if
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:46.620] you
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:46.840] want
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:46.960] to
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.240] model
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:47.540] a
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:47.860] goal
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:48.280] saying
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:48.640] that
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.000] the
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:49.240] traffic
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:49.540] light
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:49.720] will
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:49.960] turn
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.420] red,
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.140] it
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:52.300] will
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:52.480] be
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:52.780] green
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.140] until
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:53.340] it
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:53.560] turns
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:53.940] red,
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:54.220] at
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:54.440] which
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:54.960] point?
[00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.590] At
[00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:56.750] which
[00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.970] point
[00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:57.090] it
[00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:57.210] will
[00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:57.370] be
[00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:57.630] red
[00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.970] forever.
[00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.030] So
[00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.370] this
[00:44:59.370 --> 00:44:59.590] is
[00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:00.190] a
[00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:01.130] temporal
[00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.710] logic
[00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.290] of
[00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:03.890] predicates
[00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:04.110] that
[00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:04.690] express
[00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:05.710] this
[00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.170] goal,
[00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.850] and
[00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:08.110] then
[00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:09.830] if
[00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:09.950] you
[00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:10.150] want
[00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.290] to
[00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:10.550] model
[00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.830] that
[00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:11.150] using
[00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.750] PDDL,
[00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:13.970] there's
[00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:14.090] a
[00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:14.350] direct
[00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:14.810] mapping.
[00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.670] You
[00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.810] can
[00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:15.970] see
[00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:16.150] the
[00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.390] direct
[00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.690] mapping
[00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:17.090] between
[00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:17.830] the
[00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:18.290] predicates
[00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:18.510] and
[00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:19.110] the
[00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:19.830] PDDL.
[00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:20.310] So
[00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:20.770] this
[00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:20.930] is
[00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:21.330] basically
[00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:21.750] saying
[00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:22.730] if
[00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.310] it
[00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:24.430] will
[00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:24.910] always
[00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:26.010] be
[00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:26.370] green
[00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:26.690] until
[00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.850] it
[00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:27.090] turns
[00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:27.430] red.
[00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:29.190] Turning
[00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.530] red
[00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:30.030] implies
[00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.390] that
[00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.610] it
[00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:30.750] will
[00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:31.210] always
[00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:31.610] turn
[00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:31.910] red.
[00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:36.750] So
[00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:37.230] next,
[00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:37.690] please,
[00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:38.110] will
[00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:38.610] tell
[00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:38.830] us
[00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:39.130] how
[00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:39.510] to
[00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:40.190] map
[00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.830] between
[00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:41.730] the
[00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:42.650] LTL
[00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.890] to
[00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:43.530] PDDL
[00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:43.850] via
[00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:44.250] BUSHI
[00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:44.690] automata,
[00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:45.010] which
[00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:45.150] is
[00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.710] specialized
[00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:46.450] automata.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:51.380] Cool,
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.040] so
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.180] I'm
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:52.500] Elise,
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:52.860] I'm
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.120] gonna
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:53.500] kind
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:53.640] of
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:53.920] bridge
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:54.080] the
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:54.260] gap
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:54.500] between
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:54.920] LTL
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.040] and
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:55.260] the
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:55.480] planning
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:55.720] world.
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:57.000] So
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:57.340] this
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:57.440] is
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:57.560] kind
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:57.660] of
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:57.800] a
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.160] framework
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:58.420] for
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:58.560] how
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:58.720] you
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:58.840] would
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:58.960] go
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.140] from
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:45:59.340] taking
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:45:59.500] a
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:45:59.740] problem
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:45:59.940] with
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:00.320] temporally
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:00.620] extended
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:01.000] goals
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:01.460] all
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:01.540] the
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:01.600] way
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:01.700] to
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:01.860] a
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.160] plan.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:03.600] So
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.040] as
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:04.140] you
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:04.240] can
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:04.400] kind
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:04.480] of
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:04.840] imagine
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:05.120] from
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:05.300] what
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:05.480] Ben
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:05.620] and
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:05.780] Ellie
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:05.920] were
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:06.220] talking
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:06.680] about,
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:07.560] LTL's
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:07.760] pretty
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.180] expressive.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:08.360] You
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:08.480] can
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:08.740] express
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:08.880] a
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:08.980] lot
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:09.080] of
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:09.260] different
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:09.500] types
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:09.640] of
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.000] goals
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.640] that
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.340] include
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:11.840] more
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:12.140] temporal
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:12.580] properties
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:12.840] than
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.180] just
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:13.420] a
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:13.820] time
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.480] window
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:14.780] for
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:14.900] a
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:15.000] goal
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.120] to
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:15.240] be
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:15.600] completed.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:17.260] So
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:17.480] once
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:17.620] you
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:18.000] have
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.500] kind
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:18.560] of
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:18.840] defined
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.000] a
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:19.240] problem
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:19.460] with
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:19.640] these
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.000] temporally
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:20.280] extended
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:20.720] goals,
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.380] then
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:21.500] you
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:21.680] want
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:21.800] to
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.040] model
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:22.220] it
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:22.340] in
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:22.400] a
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:22.620] language
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:22.840] like
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.360] LTL
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:23.900] or
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.740] PDDL.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.360] So
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:26.480] if
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:26.520] you
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:26.680] have
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:26.760] a
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:26.960] language
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.140] like
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:27.680] PDDL
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:27.780] and
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:27.880] you
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:27.960] have
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.080] a
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.400] planner
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.140] that
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:29.300] can
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:29.540] do
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:29.720] an
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:29.940] algorithm
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:30.240] called
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:30.720] progression,
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.000] which
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:31.120] we'll
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:31.300] talk
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:31.480] about
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:31.620] a
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:31.720] little
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.060] later,
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:32.500] you
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:32.580] can
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:32.720] go
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.060] directly
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:33.500] to
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:33.800] a
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.020] plan.
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:35.700] Basically
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:35.940] how
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:36.380] progression
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:36.780] works
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:37.180] is
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.060] it's
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:38.200] kind
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:38.280] of
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:38.420] an
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:38.760] algorithm
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.060] that
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:39.300] tells
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:39.500] you
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:39.840] when
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.020] you're
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:40.420] analyzing
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:40.640] a
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:40.840] state
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:40.960] and
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.140] you're
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:41.680] analyzing
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.720] LTL
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:42.880]-like
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:43.340] formulas
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:43.540] that
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:43.640] are
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:43.800] true
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:43.900] in
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:43.980] a
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:44.260] specific

[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:45.140] how
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:45.440] to
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.860] push
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.240] formulas
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:47.400] that
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:47.500] you
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:47.600] need
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:47.720] to
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:48.020] evaluate
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:48.740] later
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:49.120] on
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:49.480] to
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:49.620] the
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:49.820] next
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:50.080] state,
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:50.480] and
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:50.600] how
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:50.700] to
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:50.840] keep
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.120] track
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:51.280] of
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:51.640] things
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.000] that
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:52.080] you
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:52.180] need
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:52.360] to
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:52.900] continue
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.160] to
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:53.520] evaluate
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:53.820] for
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.320] satisfaction
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:54.840] in
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.120] future
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:55.520] states.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.320] Another
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:57.540] way
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:57.680] you
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:57.800] can
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:57.980] do
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:58.260] this
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:58.580] is
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:46:58.820] by
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:46:59.140] taking
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:46:59.700] LTL
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.480] formulations
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:00.760] and
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.240] translating
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:01.460] them
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:01.660] into
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:01.960] Goussi
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:02.400] automata.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:02.800] So
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.100] Goussi
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:03.600] automata
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:03.860] are
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.300] basically
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:04.960] finite
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:05.220] state
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:05.600] machines
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:05.800] that
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:05.940] are
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.340] extended
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:06.800] to
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.160] handle
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.940] infinite
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.340] sequence
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:09.480] of
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:09.760] states.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:11.360] And
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:11.460] I'll
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:11.620] get
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:11.800] into
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:12.060] more
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:12.360] about
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:12.740] how
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:12.920] Goussi
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.300] automata
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:13.620] work.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:14.360] After
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:14.460] you
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:14.540] have
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:14.660] a
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:14.820] Goussi
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:15.340] automata,
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:15.540] you
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:15.680] can
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:15.840] then
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.260] translate
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:16.580] that
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:16.820] into
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:17.440] PDDL2,
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:17.740] which
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:17.860] you
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:18.040] guys
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:18.140] are
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:18.280] all
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:18.580] familiar
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:18.920] with.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:19.780] And
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:19.920] then
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.120] that
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:20.660] PDDL2
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:20.860] can
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:21.260] just
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:21.400] run
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:21.520] with
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:21.620] a
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:21.880] classical
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:22.260] planner
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:22.700] and
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:22.860] get
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:22.960] a
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.160] plan.
[00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:27.090] So
[00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:27.290] a
[00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:27.350] little
[00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:27.470] bit
[00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.650] more
[00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:27.870] about
[00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:28.130] Goussi
[00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.610] automata.
[00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:29.010] Again,
[00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.190] like
[00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.330] I
[00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:29.530] said,
[00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:29.710] it's
[00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.850] an
[00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:30.210] extension
[00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:30.410] of
[00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.650] finite
[00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.970] state
[00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:31.390] machine.
[00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:31.850] Oh,
[00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:32.070] yes,
[00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:32.270] sir.
[00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.650] Why
[00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:32.850] would
[00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:32.950] you
[00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:33.090] say
[00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:33.230] that
[00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:34.030] you
[00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.230] can
[00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.430] just
[00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.530] use
[00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:34.670] a
[00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.930] planner
[00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:35.250] that'll
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:35.840] take
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:36.460] PDDL3
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.060] straight
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:37.340] to
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:37.720] the
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.000] plan?
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.380] I
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:39.560] guess
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:39.660] it
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:39.820] just
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:40.120] depends
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.320] on
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.080] what
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:41.920] kind
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.000] of
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:42.280] planners
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:42.400] you
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:42.500] have
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:42.740] access
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:42.960] to,
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:43.260] what
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:43.640] kind
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:43.640] of
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:43.940] systems
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:44.080] you
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:44.260] have.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:44.480] It's
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:44.620] done
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:44.820] both
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:45.180] ways.
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:45.880] So
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.720] PDDL3
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:46.880] is
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:47.020] still
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:47.180] kind
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:47.280] of
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:47.500] new,
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:47.860] so
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:48.000] there's
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:48.120] not
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:48.280] a
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:48.360] lot
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:48.460] of
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:48.680] planners
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:48.940] that
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:49.360] actually
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:49.540] have
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:49.920] progression
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:50.100] and
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:50.240] can
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:50.460] handle
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.000] PDDL3.
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:55.220] It's
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:55.400] also
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:55.580] the
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:55.800] case
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.120] that
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:56.740] the
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:56.980] particular
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.520] algorithms
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.100] that
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:58.200] are
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:58.440] trying
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:58.740] to
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:47:58.980] either
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:47:59.160] do
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:47:59.640] verification
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:47:59.960] or
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.380] planning,
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:01.060] may
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:01.240] be
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:01.800] exploiting
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.220] particular
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:02.620] properties
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:02.800] of
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:02.860] the
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:03.040] Goussi
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.420] automata,
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:04.300] as
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:04.540] opposed
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:04.720] to
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:04.840] the
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.200] properties
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:05.340] of
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:05.420] the
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:05.560] native
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:05.980] language.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:09.920] So
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.320] you
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:10.480] guys
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:10.540] are
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:10.660] all
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:10.960] familiar

[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.160] machines.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:12.640] Goussi
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.020] automata
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:13.220] has
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:13.280] a
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:13.440] very
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:13.680] similar
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.260] formulation
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:15.100] with
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:15.240] some
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:15.460] slight
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:15.880] differences.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:16.140] You
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:16.220] have
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:16.320] a
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:16.440] set
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:16.580] of
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:16.940] states,
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:17.320] you
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:17.420] have
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:17.520] an
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:17.780] initial
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:18.260] state,
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:18.740] you
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:18.900] have
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:19.000] a
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:19.400] transition
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:19.840] relation,
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.120] and
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:21.260] then
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:21.360] you
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:21.580] have
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:21.740] a
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:21.880] set
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.020] of
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:22.500] accepting
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:22.880] states.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:23.180] These
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:23.560] accepting
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:23.820] states
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:23.960] are
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.380] essentially
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:24.560] what
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.040] replaces
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:25.580] finite
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:25.920] states
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.040] in
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:26.140] a
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:26.280] state
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:26.680] machine.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.180] You
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:28.280] also
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:28.400] have
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:28.480] a
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:28.560] set
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:28.720] of
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.040] symbols
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:29.500] that
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:30.260] are
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:30.540] basically
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:30.760] the
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:31.140] transitions
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:31.440] between
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:31.820] states.
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:33.140] So
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:33.340] what
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:33.460] an
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:33.780] accepting
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:34.040] state
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:34.440] is,
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:34.780] is
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:35.200] a
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:35.420] Goussi
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:35.840] automata
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:36.040] can
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:36.260] only
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:36.460] be
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:36.760] valid
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:37.420] if
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:38.020] the
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:38.320] sequence
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:38.720] of
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.560] transitions
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.080] visits
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:40.400] an
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:40.840] accepting
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:41.100] state
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:41.260] an
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:41.560] infinite
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:41.840] amount
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.000] of
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.280] times.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:43.420] So
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:43.520] I'll
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:43.620] get
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:43.760] into
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:43.920] a
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.040] couple
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:44.440] examples.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:45.540] So
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:45.840] let's
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:45.920] say
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.000] you
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:46.080] want
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:46.180] to
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:46.500] model
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.000] ticking,
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:47.520] talking
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:47.620] to
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:47.680] the
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:47.920] clock.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:48.880] This
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:49.020] is
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:49.180] just
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:49.300] a
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:49.540] regular
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:49.880] finite
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:50.120] state
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:50.400] machine.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:51.920] As
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.020] you
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:52.160] can
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:52.340] see,
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:52.600] after
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:52.980] some
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:53.700] number
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:53.840] of
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.020] ticks
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:54.200] and
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:54.460] talks,
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:54.600] you
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:54.740] get
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:54.920] into
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.400] S2,
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:55.700] and
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:55.840] you're
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:55.920] in
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:56.400] S2
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:56.780] because
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:57.560] the
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.080] transition
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:58.880] is
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:48:59.060] only
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:48:59.200] a
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:48:59.340] self
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:48:59.480] loop,
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:48:59.640] so
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:48:59.760] you're
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:48:59.860] in
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:00.100] S2
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:00.460] basically
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:00.800] forever
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.060] once
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:01.140] you
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:01.260] get
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:01.340] to
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:01.700] S2.
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:02.220] So
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:02.320] we
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:02.440] can
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:02.700] model
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:02.880] this
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:03.000] as
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.120] a
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:03.360] Goussi
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:03.780] automata
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:04.000] by
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:04.280] making
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:04.800] S2
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.280] an
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:06.620] accepting
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:06.900] state.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.220] This
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:08.620] example,
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.100] making
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:09.200] it
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:09.280] a
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:09.440] Goussi
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:09.780] automata
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:09.980] doesn't
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.160] really
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:10.320] do
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:10.560] anything
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:10.780] for
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:10.980] you.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:11.200] It's
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:11.340] just
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:11.500] kind
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:11.560] of
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:11.720] to
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.220] illustrate
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:13.140] what
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:13.280] the
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:13.560] accepting
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:13.760] state
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.060] does.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:14.880] So
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.460] the
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:15.760] accepting
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.180] words
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:16.320] are
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:16.420] a
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:16.580] sequence
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:16.940] of
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:17.640] transitions.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:17.960] In
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.100] this
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:18.320] case,
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:18.460] it
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:18.460] would
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:18.960] be
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.180] infinite
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:20.680] combinations
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:20.920] of

[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:21.280] and
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:21.500] talks
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:21.800] that
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.300] would
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:22.560] make
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:22.780] this
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:23.020] Goussi
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:23.400] automata
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:23.860] valid.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.020] Does
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:25.120] that
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:25.280] make
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:25.540] sense?
[00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.470] Questions
[00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.770] about
[00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.990] that?
[00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.950] Here's
[00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:31.130] another
[00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.490] example,
[00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:31.690] for
[00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:31.970] example,
[00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.130] if
[00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:32.170] I
[00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:32.770] change
[00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:32.990] what
[00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.190] my

[00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.770] state
[00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:34.050] was.
[00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.730] So
[00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:34.870] if
[00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.990] my
[00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.290] accepting

[00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:36.550] I
[00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:36.770] mapped
[00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:37.010] because

[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.040] I

[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:56.820] Just
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:56.960] so
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.060] that
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:57.240] everyone

[00:50:58.860 --> 00:50:59.080] In

[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.120] So

[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:08.700] you

[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.080] And
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:10.300] then
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:10.480] I

[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:12.840] But
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:12.980] as

[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:13.200] as
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:13.320] I
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:13.540] have

[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:14.700] I
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:14.940] have

[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:15.760] P
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.000] because
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.120] I

[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:18.780] So

[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:21.040] my
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:21.680] accepting
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.120] state
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:22.340] for
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:22.560] this
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:22.980] Goussi
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:23.380] automata
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:23.620] to
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:23.740] be
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:24.040] valid.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:24.540] And
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:24.660] then
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:24.880] once
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.060] I'm
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:25.160] in
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:25.480] S1,
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.120] I
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:26.280] can
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:26.620] have
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:26.900] any
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.180] other
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:27.740] amount
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:27.840] of
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.140] inputs.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:28.500] I'll
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:28.760] always
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:28.900] be
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:29.000] in
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.500] S1,
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:29.900] and
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:30.080] that's
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.160] what
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:30.300] the
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:30.780] true
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:31.780] label
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.180] means.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.220] And
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:34.360] it's
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:34.540] also
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:34.860] something
[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:35.280] stronger,
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:35.760] which
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:35.940] is
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.580] it's
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:36.880] eventually
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.380] globally.
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.340] Yeah,
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:40.580] so
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:40.980] actually,
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.040] in
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.240] this
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:43.540] case,
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:44.260] after
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:44.420] I
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:44.500] get
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:44.800] here,
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:45.920] my
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.160] input
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:46.320] can
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:46.420] be
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:46.720] anything.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:47.140] So
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:47.340] this
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:47.680] basically
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:47.920] just
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:48.100] says
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:48.440] that
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.400] for
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:49.580] my
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:49.880] initial
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:50.200] state,
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:50.360] I
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:50.580] have
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:50.740] to
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.020] execute
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:51.260] P
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:51.400] at
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:51.560] least
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:51.800] once
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:51.980] to
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:52.100] get
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:52.220] to
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:52.360] this
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:52.700] accepting
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.060] state.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:53.480] And
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:53.700] once
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:53.860] I'm
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.120] there,
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:54.500] I
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:54.640] can
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:54.780] be
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.000] there.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:55.840] I'm
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.080] always
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:56.360] there.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:56.900] Any
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.220] input
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:57.460] will
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:57.960] leave
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.180] me
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:51:58.340] in
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:58.700] S1.
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.060] So
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:00.360] just
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:00.480] to
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:00.600] make
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:00.760] this
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.120] clear
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:01.520] for
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:01.920] myself
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.160] and
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:02.520] Maitra,
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:03.440] the
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:03.760] thing
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:03.940] that's
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:04.160] being
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:04.800] executed
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.040] is
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:05.180] actually
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:15.680] S1.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:16.300] It's
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:16.520] saying
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:16.640] that
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:16.820] one
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:16.940] of
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:17.060] the
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:17.220] nodes,
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:18.460] right?
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:18.640] Yeah.
[00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:25.090] So
[00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:25.330] if
[00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:25.410] you
[00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:25.650] put
[00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:26.030] P
[00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.390] up
[00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.690] where
[00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:26.890] the
[00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:27.110] true
[00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:27.310] is
[00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:27.490] right
[00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:27.650] now,
[00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.770] then
[00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.910] you
[00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:28.050] don't
[00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:28.270] have
[00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.410] to
[00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:28.570] go
[00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:28.830] there.
[00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:29.570] Right,
[00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:29.850] that's
[00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:29.950] what
[00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:30.070] I
[00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:30.270] missed.
[00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.830] By
[00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:32.890] the
[00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:32.990] way,
[00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:33.130] you
[00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:33.630] guys
[00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:33.810] have
[00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:34.130] 25
[00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.350] more
[00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:34.590] minutes.
[00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:38.710] So
[00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.810] you
[00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:38.870] guys
[00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.930] are
[00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:39.190] exactly
[00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.390] right.
[00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:39.630] This
[00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.750] is
[00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.850] the
[00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:40.110] future.
[00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.710] So
[00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.870] an
[00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:42.130] accepted
[00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:43.150] sequence
[00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.710] of
[00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:44.910] propositions
[00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:45.090] would
[00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:45.190] be
[00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.390] not
[00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.530] P,
[00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.650] not
[00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:45.990] P.
[00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.410] Then
[00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:46.490] you
[00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.590] hit
[00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:46.910] P.
[00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.390] Then
[00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.470] it
[00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:47.570] can
[00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:47.670] be
[00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.990] anything
[00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.250] after
[00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:48.370] you
[00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:48.510] get
[00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.630] to
[00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.890] P.
[00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.670] And
[00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.790] in
[00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:50.050] this
[00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:50.350] case,
[00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:50.610] for
[00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:50.710] the
[00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.910] Goussi
[00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:51.370] automata
[00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:51.750] states,
[00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:52.070] which
[00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:52.310] are
[00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:52.530] kind
[00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:52.610] of
[00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:52.730] like
[00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.870] Ellie
[00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:53.090] pointed
[00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:53.250] out,
[00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.350] are
[00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:53.610] slightly
[00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:53.930] different
[00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:54.110] than
[00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:54.250] the
[00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:54.570] LTL
[00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:54.830] states
[00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:55.010] we've
[00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.130] been
[00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.390] talking
[00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:55.770] about.
[00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.150] In
[00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.310] this
[00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:56.490] case,
[00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:56.650] you're
[00:52:56.650 --> 00:52:56.730] in
[00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:57.190] S0.
[00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:57.590] And
[00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:57.670] then
[00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.850] once
[00:52:57.850 --> 00:52:57.930] you
[00:52:57.930 --> 00:52:58.030] get
[00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.130] to
[00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.470] S1,
[00:52:58.550 --> 00:52:58.710] you're
[00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.930] forever
[00:52:58.930 --> 00:52:59.090] in
[00:52:59.090 --> 00:52:59.430] S1.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.340] So
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:03.720] globally,
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:03.880] it
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.060] looks
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:04.700] pretty
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:05.020] similar
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:05.240] to
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:05.580] this.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:06.020] Can
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:06.380] anyone
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:06.980] take
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:07.100] a
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:07.220] few
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:07.400] minutes
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:07.540] to
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:07.700] think
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:08.040] about
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:08.480] how
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:08.620] I
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:08.760] might
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:09.080] change
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:09.460] this

[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:12.440] globally
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:12.680] on
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:12.780] my

[00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:22.250] A
[00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.570] single

[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:28.660] That's
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:28.900] exactly
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:29.060] what
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:29.060] he
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:29.180] said.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:29.380] So
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:29.540] you
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:29.820] have,
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:30.420] initially,

[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:31.420] that
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:31.600] you're
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:31.880] in.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:32.520] Because
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:32.880] P
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.080] has
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:33.200] to

[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:34.440] Forever
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:34.720] after
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:34.820] you
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:34.920] get

[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:35.200] this

[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:36.000] you
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:36.120] have

[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:37.220] P.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.060] You
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:38.400] can
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:38.600] also
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:38.920] model

[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:41.180] you
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:41.340] want
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:41.480] to.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:41.580] You
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:41.720] can
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:41.840] also
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.040] just
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:42.220] have
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:42.540] this
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.080] single

[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:43.620] which
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:43.840] would
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.500] encapsulate

[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:45.580] is.
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:47.680] So
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:47.820] this
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:47.860] is
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:48.020] kind

[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.340] all

[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:55.460] your

[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.060] automata
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:56.240] are
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:56.320] going

[00:53:58.880 --> 00:53:58.980] You
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.040] can
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:53:59.160] have

[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:00.460] I
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:00.720] said.
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:02.440] But
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:02.560] it's
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:02.700] kind

[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:08.760] So

[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:10.460] When

[00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.630] you
[00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.790] could

[00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:15.610] you
[00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:15.830] would
[00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:16.270] accept

[00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.350] you
[00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:17.490] would

[00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.330] right?
[00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:18.990] So

[00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.430] infinite
[00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.610] amount
[00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:45.750] of
[00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:46.090] times.
[00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.490] And
[00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.670] there's
[00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.870] no
[00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:47.050] way
[00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:47.170] I
[00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:47.290] can
[00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:47.450] get
[00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.690] back
[00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:47.930] to
[00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:48.230] this
[00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.570] accepting
[00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:48.730] state.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:55.820] So
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:56.240] there's
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:56.700] also
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.040] a
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:57.240] more
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:57.500] defined
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:57.840] algorithm.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:58.000] I
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:58.040] was
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:58.140] going
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:58.240] to
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:58.360] just
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:58.480] look
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:58.560] at
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:58.660] an
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:58.860] intuitive
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:54:59.240] way
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:54:59.420] to
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:54:59.740] build
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:54:59.960] a
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.200] Goussi
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:00.680] automata.
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:01.200] There's
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:01.340] an
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:01.840] algorithm.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.140] The
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:03.260] one
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:03.420] that's
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:03.560] most
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.100] popularly
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:04.280] used
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:04.420] was
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:04.680] developed
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:04.920] by
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.300] Girth.
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:05.740] This
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:05.880] is
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:06.040] kind
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:06.120] of
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:06.440] a
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.320] pseudocode
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:07.620] version
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:07.780] of
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:07.920] the
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.360] algorithm.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.280] You
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.020] can
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:10.120] go
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:10.320] from
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:10.720] LTL
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:10.920] to
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.240] Goussi.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:11.760] As
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:11.840] you
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:12.080] notice,
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:12.260] it
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:12.560] actually
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:12.840] uses
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.320] progression,
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:13.960] which
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.060] is
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:14.320] something
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:14.680] that
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.740] planners
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:16.060] that
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:16.300] take
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:17.920] PDDL
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.200] use
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:18.380] to
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:18.680] generate
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.140] plans.
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:20.780] An
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:21.000] important
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:21.200] thing
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:21.340] to
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:21.540] note,
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:21.740] which
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:21.840] I
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:21.980] won't
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:22.480] go
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:22.480] into
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:22.600] too
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:22.760] much
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.080] detail,
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:23.860] this
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:24.240] algorithm
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:24.760] generates
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.020] a
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:25.400] generalized
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:25.740] Goussi
[00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:26.180] automata,
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:26.740] which
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:26.880] you
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:27.040] then
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:27.200] need
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:27.340] to
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:28.400] change
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:28.520] to
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:28.640] a
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:28.900] simple
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:29.200] Goussi
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:29.680] automata.
[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:30.160] The
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:30.460] difference
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:30.700] is
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:30.840] a
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.160] generalized
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:31.480] Goussi
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:31.920] automata
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:32.280] has
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:32.740] a
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:33.100] set
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:33.620] of

[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:34.620] accepting
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:35.000] states.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:35.540] So
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.080] for
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:36.220] a
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:36.480] generalized

[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:37.380] be
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:37.720] accepted,
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.200] you
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:38.340] need
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:39.680] to
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:40.020] visit
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:40.680] an

[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:41.500] in

[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:41.860] one
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:41.980] of
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:42.160] those
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:42.380] sets
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:42.520] of
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:42.820] accepting
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:43.200] states.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:43.460] At
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:43.660] least
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:44.060] one
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:44.200] of

[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:44.540] states
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:44.740] has
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:44.840] to
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:44.940] be
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.160] listed.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:46.520] For
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:46.960] a
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:47.200] simple

[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:47.900] automata,
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:48.160] you
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:48.300] only
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:48.500] have
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:48.760] one
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:48.920] set
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:49.020] of

[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:49.700] states.
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:49.860] And
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:49.980] you
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.120] can
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:50.400] visit
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:50.960] any

[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:52.360] for

[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:53.240] automata
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:53.480] to
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:53.480] be
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:53.700] valid.
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:54.340] The

[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.140] between
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:55.360] those
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:55.520] two
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:55.620] is
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:55.680] a
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:55.780] little
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:55.900] bit
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:56.040] more
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:56.540] complicated.
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:57.500] And
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:57.820] we'll
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:57.980] have
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:58.240] papers
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:58.420] in
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:58.580] our
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:55:59.060] reference
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:55:59.280] that
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:55:59.500] will
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.240] walk
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:00.360] through
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:00.460] how
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:00.540] to
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:00.640] do
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:00.780] that.
[00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.690] So
[00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:04.810] this
[00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:04.910] is
[00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:05.050] the
[00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:05.430] progression
[00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.910] algorithm.
[00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:09.010] Basically,
[00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:09.490] it
[00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:09.690] just
[00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:09.950] tells
[00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:10.070] you
[00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:10.270] how,
[00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.470] if
[00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.590] you
[00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:10.810] have
[00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:11.050] a
[00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:11.430] LTL

[00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:12.230] F,
[00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.710] and
[00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:13.030] some
[00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:13.630] current
[00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.890] state
[00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:14.250] N,
[00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:14.750] and
[00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:15.110] some,
[00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.690] usually,
[00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:15.990] they
[00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.250] involve
[00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.450] some
[00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:16.670] time
[00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.890] step,
[00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:17.110] because
[00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:17.230] we're
[00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.330] in
[00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:17.410] the
[00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:17.550] real
[00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:17.790] world
[00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:17.930] and
[00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:18.050] we
[00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:18.290] can't
[00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.630] really
[00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:19.010] model
[00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:20.270] an
[00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.410] infinite
[00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:20.550] amount
[00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:20.650] of
[00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:20.970] time
[00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:21.370] and
[00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:21.810] make
[00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:22.310] it
[00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:22.870] discrete.
[00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:24.310] So
[00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:24.410] if
[00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.450] you
[00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:24.570] have
[00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:24.750] some
[00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:24.950] time
[00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:25.170] step
[00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:25.390] between
[00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:25.810] successive
[00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:26.270] states,
[00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:28.270] how
[00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.350] do
[00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:28.510] you
[00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.970] push
[00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:30.230] certain
[00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.590] LTL
[00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:30.950] formulas
[00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:31.190] onto
[00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.450] next
[00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:31.690] states
[00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:31.850] to
[00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:32.090] be
[00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:32.550] evaluated
[00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:32.950] later?
[00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:34.010] For
[00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.310] example,
[00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.570] I'll
[00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:34.830] take
[00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:35.630] this
[00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:36.030] next
[00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:36.330] F
[00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:36.890] as
[00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:37.010] an
[00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.310] example.
[00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:37.530] So
[00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:37.690] if
[00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:37.890] F
[00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:38.030] was
[00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:38.170] the

[00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:39.110] F
[00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:39.330] of
[00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:39.730] some
[00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.130] LTL
[00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.470] formula,
[00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:40.950] you
[00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:41.050] would
[00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:41.230] need
[00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.690] to
[00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:42.630] append
[00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.950] that
[00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:43.370] formula
[00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:43.610] to
[00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:43.790] the
[00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:44.090] next
[00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:44.630] state
[00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:45.230] to
[00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.350] be
[00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:45.750] evaluated
[00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:46.090] in
[00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:46.190] the
[00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.350] next
[00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:46.550] state
[00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:46.670] to
[00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.790] see
[00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:46.890] if
[00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:47.070] that's
[00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:47.230] going
[00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.310] to
[00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:47.450] be
[00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:47.590] true
[00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:47.710] or
[00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:47.910] not.
[00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.570] Similar
[00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:49.870] things
[00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:50.050] for
[00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:50.490] until
[00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:51.530] and
[00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:53.250] I
[00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:53.470] won't
[00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.710] go
[00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:53.850] through
[00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:54.110] this
[00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:54.550] formally,
[00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.750] but
[00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:54.890] it's
[00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:55.050] here
[00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:55.210] for
[00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:55.570] reference.
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:58.420] So
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:58.860] the
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:56:59.060] next
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:56:59.240] step
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:56:59.360] to
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:56:59.520] this
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:56:59.860] process
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:00.040] is
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:00.220] going
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:00.420] from
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:00.700] Goussi
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:01.120] automata
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:01.320] to
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.120] PDDL2.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.360] This
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:03.620] process
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:03.800] is
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:03.960] kind
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:04.120] of
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:04.540] confusing.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:04.720] At
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:04.760] least
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:04.900] it's
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:05.180] confusing
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:05.360] for
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:05.480] me
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:05.600] to
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.000] understand.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:07.060] So
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:07.420] the
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:07.560] first
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:07.720] thing
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:07.840] I'll
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:08.080] say
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:08.260] is
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:08.440] that
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:08.740] Goussi
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:09.000] states
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.160] are
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:09.380] not
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:09.780] equivalent
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:10.040] to
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:10.560] traditional
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.060] PDDL
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:11.360] states.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:11.880] In
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:12.000] a
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:12.400] PDDL
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:12.720] state,
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:12.940] if
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:13.000] you
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:13.120] have
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:13.560] two
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.260] states
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:14.460] that
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:14.580] have
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:14.700] the
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:14.860] same
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:15.220] number
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:15.620] of
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:15.740] the
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:15.940] same
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:16.480] propositions
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:16.660] that
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:16.780] are
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:16.900] true
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:17.060] and
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:17.340] false,
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:17.640] those
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:17.820] states
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:17.940] are
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:18.260] identical.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:19.800] In
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:19.920] a
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.100] Goussi
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:20.540] automata,
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:20.880] that's
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.000] not
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:21.420] necessarily
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:21.780] true.
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:23.500] In
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:23.620] a
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:23.760] Goussi
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:24.180] automata,
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:24.380] you
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:24.700] also
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:24.920] have
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:25.040] to
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:25.640] encapsulate
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.080] which
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:26.600] transitions
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:26.860] you
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:27.000] can
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:27.240] make
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:27.420] out
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:27.520] of
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:27.720] each
[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.040] state.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:28.620] So
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.400] S1
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:29.520] and
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.000] S2
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.460] could
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:31.020] have
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:31.400] the
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:31.940] same
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.560] set
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:32.680] of
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.080] propositions
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:33.300] that
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:33.380] are
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:33.680] true
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.000] that
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:34.880] hold.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:36.100] But
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:36.700] out
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:36.780] of
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.260] S1,
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:37.780] I
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:37.920] should
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.260] back
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:38.440] up.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.220] This
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:39.400] is
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:39.660] the
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:40.040] Goussi
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:40.380] automata
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:40.600] for
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:40.900] future
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:41.280] globally,
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.460] which
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:42.880] is
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:43.260] what
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:43.520] Christopher
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:43.760] Lamb
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:43.880] was
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:44.100] talking
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:44.320] about.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:44.520] So
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:44.660] if
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:44.740] I
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:44.960] enter
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:45.060] an

[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:46.760] means
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:46.880] I
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:47.000] have

[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.220] of
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:49.880] transition
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:50.080] that
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:50.160] I
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:50.560] want
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.080] on
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:51.620] S1.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:51.980] And
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:52.260] then
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:52.780] at
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:52.960] some
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.140] point,
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:53.280] I
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:53.380] make
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:53.520] the
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:53.780] transition
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:54.120] P.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:54.340] And
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:54.460] when
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:54.600] I'm
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:54.660] in
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:55.160] S2,
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:55.940] I
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:56.100] have
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:56.280] to
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:56.520] take
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:56.660] the
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:56.860] transition
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:57.080] P
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:57.380] forever.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:01.880] However,
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:02.440] if
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:02.580] I
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:02.700] get
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:02.820] a
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:03.080] sequence
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:03.260] of
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:03.540] inputs,
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:03.880] let's
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.020] say
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:04.140] I
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:04.460] get
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:05.460] P
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:05.700] and
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:05.900] then
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:06.440] B
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:07.440] and
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:07.600] then
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:07.780] P
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:08.140] again,
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.700] and
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:09.840] then
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:10.020] P
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:10.380] again,
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:10.760] it's
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:10.940] not
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:11.280] clear
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:11.420] if
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:11.560] I'm
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:11.640] in
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:11.940] S1
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:12.100] or
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:12.440] S2,
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:12.780] because
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:12.980] in
[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:13.360] S1,
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:13.480] I
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:13.600] can
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:13.940] execute
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:14.180] any
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:14.360] kind
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:14.440] of
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:14.580] state
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:14.740] I
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:14.980] want.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:15.500] In
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.460] S1,
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:16.560] I
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:16.720] can
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:17.040] execute
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:17.400] any
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.400] transition
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:18.620] I
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:18.820] want.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:18.960] In
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:19.440] S2,
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:19.840] I
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:20.000] have
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:20.100] to
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:20.440] execute
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:20.760] only
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:21.060] P.
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:21.540] So
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:21.660] if
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:21.740] I
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:21.860] got
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:21.980] a
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:22.200] sequence
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:22.460] of
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:22.720] Ps,
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:23.260] I
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:23.380] can
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:23.500] be
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:23.600] in
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:23.800] either
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:24.160] state.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:25.920] So
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.060] you
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:26.360] need
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.100] something
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:27.460] else
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:27.600] to
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:27.680] add
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:27.780] to
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:28.260] PDDL2
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:28.540] to
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:29.100] determine
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:29.960] which
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:30.220] state
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:30.380] you're
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:30.640] in
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:30.800] and
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:30.980] which
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:31.460] transitions
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:31.660] you
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:31.780] can
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:31.980] make
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:32.240] from
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:32.440] that
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:32.780] state.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:34.920] Does
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:35.020] that
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:35.320] make
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:35.480] sense
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:35.620] to
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:35.760] everyone?
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:40.220] So
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:40.440] there's
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:40.700] two
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:40.920] ways
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:41.020] you
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:41.160] can
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.480] transform
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.480] PDDL2
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:43.980] to
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:44.720] encapsulate
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.280] what
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:45.440] a
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:45.680] Goussi
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.180] automata
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:46.840] encapsulates.
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:47.300] The
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:47.520] first
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:47.680] thing
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:47.820] is
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:47.920] you
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:48.040] can
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:48.360] create
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:48.640] new
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.120] actions
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:49.320] that
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:49.940] encapsulate
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:50.700] the
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:51.120] allowable
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:51.580] transitions
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:51.780] in
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:51.940] each
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:52.220] state.
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:53.560] This
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:53.660] would
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:54.020] basically
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:54.300] mean
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:54.500] that
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:54.700] for
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:54.960] every
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:55.400] action
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:55.560] you
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:55.740] have
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:55.840] in
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:55.980] your
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:56.260] traditional
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:56.940] PDDL,
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:57.300] you
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:57.460] have
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:57.580] to
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:57.800] create
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:57.980] a
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:00.520] repetitive
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:00.880] action
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:01.120] for
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:01.380] each
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:01.540] one
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:01.640] of
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:01.820] these
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:02.140] states,
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:02.560] so
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:02.640] you
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:02.760] know
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.180] exactly
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:03.380] which
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:03.740] transition
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:03.940] you
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.080] can
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:04.280] take
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:04.480] out
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:04.560] of
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:04.720] that
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.020] state.
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:06.540] This
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:06.680] can
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:06.940] get
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:07.400] long,
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:08.020] because
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:08.120] you
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:08.320] have
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:08.400] to
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:08.580] make
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:08.780] a
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:09.080] new
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:09.640] action
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:10.200] for
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:10.500] every
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:10.780] single
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:10.940] one
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:11.040] of
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:11.160] these
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:11.380] states
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:11.540] for
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:11.800] every
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.100] action
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:12.260] that
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:12.360] you
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:12.500] want
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:12.620] to
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:12.820] take.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:13.920] But
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:14.040] that
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:14.160] is
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:14.320] one
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:14.420] way
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:14.560] you
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:14.660] can
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:14.800] do
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:14.980] it.
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:16.040] Another
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:16.280] way
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:16.400] you
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:16.520] can
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:16.680] do
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:16.860] it
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:17.060] is
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:17.560] introducing
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.000] derived
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:18.520] predicates.
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:19.300] Derived
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:19.740] predicates
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:19.860] are
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:20.240] predicates
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:20.420] that
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:20.660] don't
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:20.900] depend
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:21.040] on
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:21.160] the
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:21.440] actions
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:21.580] at
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:21.740] all
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:21.860] and
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.040] just
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:22.300] depend
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:22.460] on
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:22.600] some
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:22.800] other
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:23.180] formula
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:23.640] in
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:23.760] your
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.060] plan.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.160] So
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:25.520] for
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:25.780] example,
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:25.960] we
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.080] could
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:26.280] have
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:26.400] a
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:26.600] derived
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:26.980] predicate
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:27.260] that
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:28.300] explicitly
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:28.760] tells
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:28.960] you
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.320] whether
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:29.540] you're
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:29.640] in
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.040] S1
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:30.260] or
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:30.500] whether
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:30.700] you're
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:30.780] in
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:31.180] S2.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:31.720] And
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:31.820] you
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:31.940] can
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:32.140] use
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:32.320] these
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:32.740] predicates
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:32.900] in
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.040] your
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:33.400] actions
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:33.620] in
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:34.260] PDDL2
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:34.840] to
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:35.100] make
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:35.460] sure
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.120] you
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:36.440] know
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:36.740] which
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:37.020] state
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:37.440] S1
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:37.560] or
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:37.860] S2
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:38.080] you're
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:38.320] in
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:38.460] in
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:38.580] your
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:38.820] Goussi
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:39.260] automata.
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:39.920] And
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.220] then
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:40.440] in
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:40.540] your
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:40.940] formulation
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:41.220] of
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:41.340] your
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:41.660] plan,
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:42.180] you
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:42.360] set
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:42.700] your
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:43.880] final
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:44.160] state
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:44.360] to
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:44.560] be
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:44.840] one
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:44.920] of
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:45.040] the
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:45.380] accepting
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:45.780] states.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:46.340] So
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:46.900] I
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:47.040] guess
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:47.180] that
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:47.540] answers
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:47.820] one
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:47.920] of
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.000] the
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:48.260] questions
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:48.680] about
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.380] how
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:49.580] you
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:49.960] go
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:50.180] from
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:50.900] infinite
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:51.140] to
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:51.380] finite.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:51.840] The
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:52.200] accepting
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:52.480] state
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:52.680] is
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.080] usually
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:53.560] what
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:53.740] you
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:54.560] place
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:54.720] as
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:54.880] your
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:55.200] final
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:55.480] state.
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:56.060] And
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:56.180] then
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:56.320] the
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:56.580] derived
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:57.020] predicates
[00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:57.300] appear
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:58.140] purely
[00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:58.360] in
[00:59:58.360 --> 00:59:58.520] the
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.260] preconditions?
[00:59:59.680 --> 00:59:59.940] Or
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:00.060] do
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:00.200] they
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:00.460] also
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:00.740] appear
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:00.880] in
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:00.920] the
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:00.920] effects?
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.020] They
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:01.300] also
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:01.560] appear
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:01.680] in
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:01.780] the
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.140] effects,
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:03.800] because
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:03.900] you
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.020] need
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:04.160] to
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:04.500] know
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:04.780] if
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.040] you
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.520] have
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:05.840] transitioned
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:06.100] out
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:06.220] of
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:06.480] S1
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:06.700] to
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.080] S2.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:07.980] So
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.140] you
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:08.560] likely
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:08.920] have
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.300] a
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:09.500] derived
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:09.800] predicate
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.040] for
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.300] both
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:10.780] S1
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:10.940] and
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.080] a
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:11.220] derived
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:11.440] predicate
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:11.660] for
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.180] S2.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:13.360] And
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:13.480] that
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:13.620] is
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:13.900] also
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:14.280] a
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:14.580] lot
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:14.640] of
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:14.800] work
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.100] to
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:15.480] add
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:15.620] to
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:15.740] a
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.180] PDDL2
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:16.560] problem,
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:16.880] but
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.120] it's
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:17.380] definitely
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:17.700] shorter
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:17.860] than
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:18.000] the
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:18.220] first
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:18.440] way.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:19.260] And
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:19.640] it
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:19.900] definitely
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.280] encapsulates
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:20.700] everything.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:23.340] Does
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:23.460] anyone
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:23.620] have
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:23.760] any
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.000] questions
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:24.240] about
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:24.440] that?
[01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:26.070] So
[01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:26.250] you
[01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:26.370] are
[01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:26.690] changing
[01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:26.910] the
[01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:27.170] action,
[01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:27.370] then?
[01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:27.950] Yes,
[01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.450] you're
[01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:28.790] changing
[01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:29.570] the
[01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:29.850] action,
[01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:30.130] but
[01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:30.250] you
[01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:30.390] don't
[01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.530] need
[01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.650] to
[01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.810] make
[01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:30.930] a
[01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:31.090] new
[01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:31.470] action
[01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:32.390] for
[01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.650] every
[01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:33.030] state.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:34.680] In
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:34.800] the
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:34.980] first
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:35.480] formulation,
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:37.880] let's
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.000] say
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:38.080] I
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:38.220] have
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:38.400] some
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:38.740] traditional
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:39.220] action,
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:39.580] like
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:39.800] move
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.040] block
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:40.240] or
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:40.520] something.
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:41.020] I
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:41.160] have
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:41.280] to
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:41.440] create
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:41.580] a
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:41.780] move
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.040] block
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:42.400] action
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:42.840] for
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.100] each
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:43.300] one
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:43.420] of
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:43.640] these
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.420] states,
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:44.720] because
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:44.840] I
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:44.960] need
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.080] to
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:45.320] know
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:45.720] exactly
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:45.940] which
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:46.360] transitions
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:46.560] I
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:46.700] can
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:46.920] take
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.480] out
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:47.580] of
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:47.740] that
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.000] action.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:48.220] In
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:48.380] the
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:48.640] second
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.040] example.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.160] And
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:49.280] then
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:49.460] the
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:49.680] second
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.000] one,
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:50.420] I
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:50.540] can
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:50.680] just
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:50.840] have
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.040] one
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:51.280] move
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:51.600] block.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.200] But
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:53.600] in
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:53.760] my
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:53.940] move
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:54.120] block,
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:54.280] I'll
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:54.420] have
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:54.500] a
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:54.820] derived
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:55.200] predicate
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:55.560] that
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:55.880] tells
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.140] me
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:56.380] which
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:56.580] state
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:56.840] I'm
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.120] in
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.220] when
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:00:59.460] I
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.060] execute
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:00.280] that
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:00.580] action.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:04.500] So
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:05.380] the
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:05.560] number
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.380] of
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:06.640] actions
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:06.800] you
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:06.900] have
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:07.020] to
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:07.160] write
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:07.320] is
[01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:07.660] less,
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.380] because
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:08.500] you
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.140] explicitly
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:09.420] have
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:09.820] predicates
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:09.960] that
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.060] are
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:10.320] telling
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:10.500] you
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:10.780] which
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.000] state
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:11.180] that
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:11.340] you're
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:11.520] in
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:11.800] each
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.020] time.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.220] Now
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:15.380] I'm
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:15.420] going
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:15.540] to
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:15.680] hand
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:15.760] it
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:15.940] over
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:16.340] to,
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:17.020] if
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:17.120] there
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:17.180] are
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:17.220] no
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:17.360] more
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:17.620] questions,
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:18.180] I'm
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:18.220] going
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:18.260] to
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:18.300] hand
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:18.300] it
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:18.380] over
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:18.580] to
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:18.900] Mark,
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:19.480] who's
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:19.580] going
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:19.600] to
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:19.780] talk
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:19.960] about
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.340] pregnancies.
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:23.420] All
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:23.640] right.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.180] So
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.020] I'm
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:25.140] getting
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:25.320] a
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:25.420] little
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:25.680] low
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:25.860] on
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.140] time,
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:26.700] but
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:26.900] that's
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.100] OK.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:27.820] So
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:28.020] now
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:28.140] I'll
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:28.500] transition
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:28.740] to
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.020] talking
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:29.340] about,
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:29.520] we've
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:29.760] talked
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:29.980] about
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:30.340] temporally
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:30.600] extended
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.060] goals.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:31.420] And
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:31.580] we've
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:31.740] said
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:31.900] that
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:32.140] goals
[01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:32.260] are
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:32.480] things
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:32.620] that
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:32.880] always
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.080] have
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:33.180] to
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:33.300] be
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:33.500] true
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:33.580] in
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:33.620] a
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:33.840] plan.
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:34.380] So
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:34.520] now
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:34.660] let's
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:34.880] talk
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.140] about
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:35.620] preferences.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.160] Preferences
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:36.400] are
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:36.660] things
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:36.840] that
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.000] don't
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:37.380] necessarily
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:37.660] have
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:37.760] to
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:37.880] be
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.080] true,
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:38.260] but
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.280] things
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:39.400] that
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:39.540] you'd
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:39.720] like
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:39.840] to
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:39.960] be
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.100] true.
[01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.850] So
[01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:41.950] in
[01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:42.030] the
[01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:42.310] classical
[01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:42.610] planning
[01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:42.950] problem,
[01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:43.130] we
[01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.250] can
[01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.510] formulate
[01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.650] it
[01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:44.430] like
[01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.730] that.
[01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:45.190] We
[01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.270] have
[01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.350] a
[01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:45.450] set
[01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:45.590] of
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:45.850] states
[01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:46.270] S,
[01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:46.670] initial
[01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.910] state
[01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:47.470] S0,
[01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.850] a
[01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:47.930] set
[01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:48.030] of
[01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:48.470] operators,
[01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:48.770] and
[01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:48.890] a
[01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.990] set
[01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:49.090] of
[01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:49.250] goal
[01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:49.590] states.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.210] And
[01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.310] the
[01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:50.590] problem
[01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:50.770] is
[01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:51.190] to
[01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:52.010] transition
[01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.230] from
[01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.330] your
[01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:52.550] initial
[01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:52.910] state
[01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:53.130] to
[01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:53.310] any
[01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:53.590] state
[01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:53.730] that
[01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:54.010] fulfills
[01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:54.170] your
[01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.330] goal
[01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:54.650] state
[01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:55.230] using
[01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.350] the
[01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:55.770] operators
[01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:56.010] in
[01:01:56.010 --> 01:01:56.230] A.
[01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:57.470] In
[01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.570] a
[01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:57.890] preference
[01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:58.230]-based
[01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.550] planning
[01:01:58.550 --> 01:01:58.950] problem,
[01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.270] we
[01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.670] introduce
[01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.870] this
[01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:00.290] additional
[01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:00.710] field
[01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:01.210] R,
[01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:02.270] which
[01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.430] is
[01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.610] a
[01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:02.990] partial
[01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.190] or
[01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.350] total
[01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:03.810] relation
[01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:04.290] expressing
[01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:04.850] preferences
[01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:05.490] between
[01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:06.550] plans.
[01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.710] And
[01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.830] this
[01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:06.950] is
[01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:07.090] a
[01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:07.310] little
[01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.290] preference
[01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:09.270] symbol
[01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.490] right
[01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:09.690] there.
[01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:10.450] So
[01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:10.610] that
[01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:10.970] basically
[01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:11.290] tells
[01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:11.490] you,
[01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.690] if
[01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:11.790] there
[01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:11.890] are
[01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:12.190] multiple
[01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.610] plans
[01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:12.830] to
[01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:13.390] accomplish
[01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.650] your
[01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:13.870] goal,
[01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:14.790] which
[01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:15.010] one
[01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:15.110] do
[01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:15.210] you
[01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:15.510] want
[01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.650] to
[01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:16.010] use?
[01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:17.330] And
[01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:17.550] again,
[01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:17.950] preferences
[01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:18.210] are
[01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:18.610] properties
[01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:18.950] that
[01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:19.170] are
[01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:19.590] desired
[01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:19.790] but
[01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:19.950] not
[01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:20.270] necessarily
[01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:20.950] required
[01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:21.230] to
[01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.370] be
[01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:21.450] in
[01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:21.650] it.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:23.660] So
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:23.780] there
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:23.860] are
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:24.220] two
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.060] different
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:25.640] types
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:25.880] of
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.240] preference
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:26.780] languages,
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:27.920] quantitative
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.240] and
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:28.560] qualitative.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:29.180] As
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:29.260] you
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:29.360] would
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:29.760] expect,
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.000] in
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.500] quantitative
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:30.940] languages,
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:31.240] we
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:31.500] actually
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:31.900] assign
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:32.020] a
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:32.380] numeric
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:32.840] value
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.880] to
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.160] the
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:34.380] different
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:34.680] plans
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:34.920] in
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:35.000] order
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:35.160] to
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:35.420] compare
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:35.720] them.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:36.160] So
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:36.400] this
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:36.700] plan
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:36.820] is
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:36.940] a
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:37.400] weight
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:37.560] of
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:37.920] 4
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.080] and
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:38.200] a
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:38.300] weight
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:38.420] of
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:38.700] 2,
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:38.940] and
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.400] that
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:39.600] tells
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:39.700] you
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:39.840] which
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:39.980] one
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:40.060] you
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:40.320] prefer.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:41.080] And
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:41.240] here
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:41.320] are
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:41.480] some
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:41.780] languages
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:41.980] that
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.120] do
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:42.360] that.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:42.920] But
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.120] for
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:43.540] qualitative
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:44.160] languages,
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:44.800] we
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.060] actually
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:45.360] just
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:45.800] have
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.440] this
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:46.700] type
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:46.840] of
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.000] plan.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:47.260] This
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:47.840] plan
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:47.960] with
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:48.100] this
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:48.400] property
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:48.600] is
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:48.900] preferred
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:49.100] to
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:49.320] this
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:49.580] other
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:49.860] plan,
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:50.080] with
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:50.660] this
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.020] property.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:51.920] But
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.020] we
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:52.140] don't
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:52.400] actually
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:52.760] know
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:53.040] any
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:53.200] sort
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:53.300] of
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:53.780] information
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:54.240] about
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:54.880] how
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:55.100] much
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:55.240] we
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:55.480] prefer
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:55.680] one
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:55.800] to
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:55.900] the
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:56.060] other
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:56.220] or
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:56.360] something
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:56.560] like
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:56.740] that.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:57.460] And
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:57.600] an
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:57.800] important
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.100] outcome
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:58.280] of
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:58.540] this
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.000] is,
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:02:59.480] when
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:02:59.540] you
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:02:59.660] have
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:00.240] quantitative
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:00.740] languages,
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.020] they're
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.480] totally
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:01.920] comparable.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:02.200] So
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:02.340] for
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:02.560] any
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:02.780] two
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.080] sets
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:03.220] of
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:03.540] plans,
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:03.720] you
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:03.860] can
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.240] determine
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:04.500] which
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:04.660] one
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:04.760] is
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.040] preferred.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.200] Whereas
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:06.400] in
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:06.720] qualitative
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.140] languages,
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:07.360] you
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:07.500] could
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:07.600] have
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:07.680] a
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.120] situation
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:08.480] where
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:08.740] plan
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:08.960] 1
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.100] is
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:09.380] preferred
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:09.520] to
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:09.720] plan
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.000] 2,
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:10.640] and
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:10.840] plan
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:11.000] 1
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:11.120] is
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:11.340] also
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:11.640] preferred
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:11.780] to
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:11.960] plan
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.280] 3,
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:12.820] but
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:12.900] that
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.140] doesn't
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:13.300] give
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:13.380] you
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:13.540] any
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:13.960] information
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.160] about
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:14.320] whether
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:14.600] plan
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:14.840] 2
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.600] is
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:15.860] preferred
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.060] to
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:16.240] plan
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:16.540] 3.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:17.180] So
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:17.260] it's
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:17.360] a
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:17.440] little
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:17.620] bit
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:17.900] less
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:18.300] expressive
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:18.540] there.
[01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:21.270] So
[01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.370] to
[01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:21.530] go
[01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:21.790] into
[01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:22.810] how
[01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:22.970] you
[01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:23.270] actually
[01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.710] express
[01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:24.130] preferences
[01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:24.330] in
[01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:24.870] PDDL3,
[01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:25.130] like
[01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.270] we
[01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.470] talked
[01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.690] about
[01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:25.870] with
[01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:26.170] temporally
[01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:26.430] extended
[01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.770] goals,
[01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:27.030] there
[01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:27.190] is
[01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.410] some
[01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:28.050] PDDL3
[01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:28.670] syntax
[01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.990] to
[01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.110] do
[01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:29.310] this.
[01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:30.050] There's
[01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:30.570] a
[01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:31.190] label,
[01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:31.730] a

[01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:32.370] label
[01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:32.570] here,
[01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.730] which
[01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:32.810] you
[01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:32.910] can
[01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:33.070] put
[01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:33.250] on
[01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:33.610] fluents
[01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:33.730] to
[01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:34.110] represent
[01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.070] things
[01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:35.230] that
[01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:35.410] you
[01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:36.550] prefer.
[01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.250] And
[01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:37.330] then
[01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:37.470] there's
[01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.590] a
[01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:37.870] function
[01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:38.150] called
[01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:39.010] isViolated
[01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:39.170] that
[01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.570] essentially
[01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:40.070] returns
[01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:40.230] a
[01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.430] number
[01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.610] of
[01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:40.950] times
[01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:41.150] that
[01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.370] any
[01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:41.670] fluent
[01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.970] that
[01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:42.130] has
[01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:42.970] a
[01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:43.230] preference
[01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:43.530] label
[01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.170] was
[01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:44.370] not
[01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:44.810] satisfied
[01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:44.990] in
[01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.110] your
[01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:45.330] plan.
[01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:46.010] For
[01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:46.430] example,
[01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:46.630] if
[01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.690] you
[01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:46.830] had
[01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:46.970] the
[01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:47.410] preference,
[01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:48.050] traffic
[01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:48.230] light
[01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.370] is
[01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:48.610] green
[01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:48.850] until
[01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:49.010] it
[01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.190] turns
[01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.390] red.
[01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:49.570] So
[01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:49.890] here's
[01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:50.210] our
[01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.090] PDDL3
[01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:51.570] temporally
[01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:51.990] extended,
[01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:52.550] in
[01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:52.650] this
[01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:52.830] case,
[01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:53.370] preference
[01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:54.870] language.
[01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.350] And
[01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:55.430] we
[01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.670] label
[01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.810] it
[01:03:55.810 --> 01:03:55.910] with
[01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:56.010] a
[01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:56.330] preference
[01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:56.610] label
[01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:56.910] here.
[01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:57.130] This
[01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:57.210] is
[01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:57.370] just
[01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:57.490] a
[01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:57.710] name.
[01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.950] And
[01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:59.070] then
[01:03:59.070 --> 01:03:59.210] our
[01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.510] metric,
[01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.750] our
[01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:00.130] plan,
[01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.850] basically
[01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:01.150] tries
[01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.290] to
[01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:01.650] minimize
[01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:01.890] the
[01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:02.070] number
[01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:02.250] of
[01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:02.630] times
[01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.870] that
[01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:03.190] this
[01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:04.170] preference
[01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:04.410] is
[01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:04.730] violated.
[01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.990] So
[01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.190] that's
[01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.350] one
[01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:05.490] way
[01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:05.610] to
[01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:05.870] actually
[01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:06.290] express
[01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:06.730] preferences
[01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:07.550] directly
[01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:07.790] in
[01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:08.330] PDDL3.
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.200] All
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:11.300] right,
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:11.400] so
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:11.560] now
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:11.660] I'm
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:11.700] going
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:11.720] to
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:11.900] talk
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:12.060] about
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:12.440] LPP.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.180] LPP
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:14.460] is
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:14.600] a
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:14.800] different
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.260] language
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:15.900] that
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.100] is
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:16.840] quite
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.240] expressive
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:17.620] in
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:17.840] terms
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.060] of
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:18.360] the
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:18.540] types
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:18.680] of
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:18.980] preferences
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:19.200] you
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:19.300] can
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:19.660] represent.
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:20.460] It's
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:20.820] quantitative
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.200] language,
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.340] which
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:22.540] means
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:22.700] we're
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:22.780] going
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:22.800] to
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.160] have
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:24.500] weights
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:24.720] for
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:24.820] each
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:24.920] of
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.020] our
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:25.300] plans
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:25.860] to
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:26.140] express
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:26.280] our
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:26.620] preferences.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:26.860] And
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:26.960] we
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.320] can
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:27.540] actually
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:28.000] express
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:28.340] the
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:28.700] strength
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:28.820] of
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:28.940] the
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:29.220] preference
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:29.580] goal
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:29.820] A
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:29.940] is
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:30.240] preferred
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:30.720] 20
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:30.860] to
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:31.020] 30
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:31.280] times
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:31.420] as
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:31.720] much
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.400] as
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:32.980] goal
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:33.140] B.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.260] It's
[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:34.340] the
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:34.580] extension
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:34.780] of
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:34.880] a
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.040] global
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:35.360] language
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:35.600] named
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:35.860] PP.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:36.540] And
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:36.880] here's
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.440] the
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:37.660] paper
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:37.860] if
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:37.940] you
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.040] want
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:38.160] to
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.400] actually
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:38.700] check
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:38.900] out
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:39.320] the
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:39.880] details.
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:41.300] The
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:41.720] formulas
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:41.900] are
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:42.260] constructed
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:42.920] hierarchically.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:43.120] So
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:43.240] I'll
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:43.380] go
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:43.560] through
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:43.860] quickly
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:44.080] how
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:44.240] we
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:44.520] actually
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.200] construct
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.200] these
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:46.560] preference
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:46.800] formulas.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:47.860] So
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:48.000] the
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.260] lowest
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:48.500] level
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:48.640] is
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:48.820] called
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:48.940] a
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:49.200] basic
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:49.560] desired
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:49.980] formula,
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:50.260] or
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:50.700] BDF,
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:51.300] and
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:51.460] that
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:51.660] just
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:52.060] expresses
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:52.300] our
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:52.720] temporally
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.080] extended
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:53.700] propositions.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:53.920] So
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.060] this
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:54.200] is
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:54.480] just
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.200] straight
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:55.360] up
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:55.800] LTL,
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:56.080] basically,
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:56.300] as
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:56.400] we
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:56.560] saw
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:56.680] in
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:56.760] the
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:56.960] first
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.220] section
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:57.340] of
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:57.400] the
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:57.740] presentation.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:58.540] So
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:58.720] I'm
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:58.820] going
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:04:58.820] to
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:04:58.980] use
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:04:59.160] a
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:04:59.540] cooking
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:04:59.840] dinner
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.260] example
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:00.540] through
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:00.900] a
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.120] few
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:01.460] slides.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:01.800] So
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.520] in
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:02.660] this
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:02.860] case,
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.000] we
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:03.220] always
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:03.460] just
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:03.640] use
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:03.800] the
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.040] future
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:04.440] operator.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:04.680] So
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:04.800] at
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:04.940] some
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:05.240] point,
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:05.720] I
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:05.860] might
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:05.980] want
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.080] to
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:06.320] cook
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:06.500] as
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:06.660] part
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:06.740] of
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:06.840] our
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.100] plan.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:07.500] Maybe
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:07.620] I
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:07.780] want
[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:07.880] to
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.100] order
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:08.560] takeout
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:08.840] to
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.060] eat
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:09.340] dinner.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.300] And
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:10.400] then
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:10.480] I
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:10.740] have
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:11.060] some
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:11.520] eating
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:11.880] spaghetti
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.040] or
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:12.200] eating
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:12.500] pizza.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:12.700] Those
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:12.800] are
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:12.920] two
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.160] different
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:13.540] things,
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:13.800] two
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.000] different
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:14.360] options
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:14.520] that
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:14.620] I
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:14.740] could
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:14.900] have
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.000] in
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:15.120] my
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:15.300] plan.
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:15.420] I
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:15.560] don't
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:15.820] have
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:15.920] to
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.060] have
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:16.280] either
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:16.460] of
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:16.600] those.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:17.840] Those
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:17.920] are
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.060] just
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:18.380] options
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:18.540] that
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:18.640] I'm
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:18.720] going
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:18.740] to
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:18.940] have.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:20.340] So
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:20.520] that's
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:20.620] the
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:20.820] lowest
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:21.080] level.
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:21.280] The
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:21.480] next
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:21.680] level
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:21.820] is
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:22.000] called
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:22.340] atomic
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:22.740] preference
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:23.120] formulas,
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:23.340] or
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.080] APFs.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:24.600] And
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:24.960] these
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.100] are
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:25.600] where
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:25.740] we
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:26.020] express
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:26.240] our
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:26.580] preferences
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.040] between
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:27.220] the
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:27.700] BDFs
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:27.860] that
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:28.260] we
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:28.600] informed
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:28.720] on
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:28.820] the
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:29.100] previous
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:29.420] slide.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.020] So
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:30.140] in
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:30.260] this
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:30.600] example,
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:30.780] I'm
[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:30.980] using
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:31.380] weight
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.380] specifically
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:32.620] to
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:32.940] represent
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.340] preferences
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:33.540] with
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:33.760] lower
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.020] weights
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:34.280] being
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:34.640] inferred.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:35.420] So
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:36.100] here,
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:36.340] we're
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:36.600] saying
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:36.780] if
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:36.900] you
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:37.060] prefer
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:37.240] to
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:37.500] cook
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:37.960] over
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:38.280] ordering
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:38.680] takeout,
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:38.920] so
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.460] this
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.060] is
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:40.120] the
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:40.460] BDF
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:40.600] for
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:40.780] cook.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:41.020] This
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:41.120] is
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:41.200] the
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:41.500] BDF
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:41.580] for
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:41.820] ordering
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:42.280] takeout.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:42.840] We
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.040] can
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:43.480] apply
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:43.920] weights
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.660] to
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:44.860] those
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.040] to
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:45.380] express
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.080] which
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:46.320] one's
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:46.620] preferred
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:46.760] and
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:46.920] how
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:47.140] much
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:47.260] is
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:47.600] preferred
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:47.900] over
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:48.020] the
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:48.300] previous
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:48.540] plan,
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.240] and
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:49.660] here's
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:50.440] preferring
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:50.840] spaghetti
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.640] over
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:51.900] eating
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.180] pizza.
[01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:54.050] So
[01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:54.230] that's
[01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.330] the
[01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:54.510] second
[01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:54.770] level.
[01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.930] Third
[01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:56.210] level
[01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.370] is
[01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:56.570] called
[01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:56.930] general
[01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:57.290] preference
[01:05:57.290 --> 01:05:57.650] formulas,
[01:05:57.790 --> 01:05:57.870] or
[01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:58.490] GPFs.
[01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:59.110] And
[01:05:59.110 --> 01:05:59.310] these
[01:05:59.310 --> 01:05:59.430] are
[01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.590] where
[01:05:59.590 --> 01:05:59.750] we
[01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.870] can
[01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:00.010] do
[01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:00.650] conjunctions
[01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.830] or
[01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:01.410] disjunctions
[01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:01.610] or
[01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:02.110] qualification
[01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:02.770] of
[01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:02.910] our
[01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:03.270] previous
[01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.690] formulas.
[01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.310] So
[01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:04.490] for
[01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.890] example,
[01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.670] if
[01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.790] we
[01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:06.030] want
[01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:06.310] to
[01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:06.770] say,
[01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:07.450] in
[01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:07.550] the
[01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:07.850] previous
[01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:08.150] slide,
[01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.310] we
[01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:08.410] had
[01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:08.630] two
[01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:09.170] APFs.
[01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:09.350] We
[01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:09.550] had
[01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:10.170] we
[01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:10.450] prefer
[01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:10.610] to
[01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:10.870] cook
[01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:11.010] and
[01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:11.090] we
[01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:11.330] prefer
[01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:11.470] to
[01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.610] eat
[01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:11.910] spaghetti.
[01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:13.470] And
[01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.610] here,
[01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.710] we
[01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.850] can
[01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:14.210] express
[01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.430] that
[01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:14.570] we
[01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:14.750] really
[01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.990] don't
[01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.250] care
[01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:15.490] which
[01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:15.670] one
[01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.790] of
[01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:16.030] these
[01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:16.350] we
[01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:16.670] want
[01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.990] to
[01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:18.190] satisfy.
[01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:19.150] You
[01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.250] can
[01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:19.430] think
[01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.550] of
[01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:19.710] this
[01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:19.930] as
[01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:20.250] basically
[01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:20.550] trying
[01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:20.710] to
[01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:21.110] satisfy
[01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:21.290] this
[01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:21.730] APF,
[01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:21.970] the
[01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:22.230] lowest
[01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.570] weight.
[01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:23.150] So
[01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.270] if
[01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.350] we
[01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:23.530] have
[01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:23.750] this
[01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:24.150] OR
[01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.730] operator
[01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:25.090] here,
[01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:25.350] that
[01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:25.550] means
[01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:25.750] that
[01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.970] our
[01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:26.290] planner
[01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:26.530] is
[01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:26.650] going
[01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:26.730] to
[01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:26.930] try
[01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:27.090] and
[01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:27.410] satisfy
[01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.670] the
[01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.910] lowest
[01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:28.250] weight
[01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:28.470] among
[01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.710] all
[01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.870] these
[01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:29.090] different
[01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:29.410] options
[01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:29.610] here,
[01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:29.770] which
[01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:29.830] in
[01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:30.010] this
[01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:30.230] case
[01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.590] is
[01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:31.170] preferring
[01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:31.290] to
[01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:31.490] cook.
[01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:31.770] That's
[01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:31.890] its
[01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:32.150] first
[01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.410] goal.
[01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:33.670] You
[01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.790] can
[01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:34.170] also
[01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:35.290] use
[01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:35.410] an
[01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:35.570] AND
[01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:35.930] operator,
[01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:36.130] for
[01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:36.450] example,
[01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.590] and
[01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:36.750] that's
[01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.850] going
[01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:36.990] to
[01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.510] minimize
[01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:38.170] the
[01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:38.490] maximum
[01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:38.830] weight
[01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:39.190] across
[01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.430] both
[01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.550] of
[01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:39.690] those
[01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:39.990] options.
[01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.130] So
[01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.410] basically,
[01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:40.610] what
[01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:40.710] it's
[01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.810] going
[01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:40.850] to
[01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:41.010] try
[01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:41.130] and
[01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:41.350] do
[01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:43.970] is
[01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.750] minimize
[01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:45.430] the
[01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:46.510] highest
[01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.830] weight
[01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:47.070] among
[01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:47.270] these
[01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.450] two
[01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.770] options.
[01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:48.050] So
[01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:48.210] it's
[01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:48.310] going
[01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:48.410] to
[01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.610] try
[01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:48.870] and
[01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:51.810] cook,
[01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:51.990] and
[01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:52.090] it's
[01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:52.210] going
[01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:52.270] to
[01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:52.430] try
[01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.530] and
[01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:52.630] eat
[01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.950] spaghetti,
[01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:53.590] versus
[01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:53.830] doing
[01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:53.970] these
[01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:54.170] other
[01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.510] options.
[01:06:57.690 --> 01:06:58.090] OK,
[01:06:58.170 --> 01:06:58.290] so
[01:06:58.290 --> 01:06:58.450] those
[01:06:58.450 --> 01:06:58.550] are
[01:06:58.550 --> 01:06:59.250] GPFs.
[01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:00.030] And
[01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:00.170] now,
[01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:00.430] moving
[01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.690] on
[01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:01.130] to
[01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:02.050] aggregated
[01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:02.390] preference
[01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.690] formulas,
[01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.930] which
[01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:02.970] are
[01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:03.110] the
[01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:03.430] highest
[01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.710] level.
[01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:04.730] So
[01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:05.130] with
[01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:05.850] APFs,
[01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.730] these
[01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:07.030] define
[01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:07.230] the
[01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.490] order
[01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.630] in
[01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.750] which
[01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.870] our
[01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:08.090] different
[01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:08.490] preferences
[01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:08.710] are
[01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:09.090] relaxed.
[01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:09.270] You
[01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.410] can,
[01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:09.570] of
[01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:09.690] course,
[01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:10.050] express
[01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:10.290] a
[01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:10.390] lot
[01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.490] of
[01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:10.690] different
[01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:11.030] preferences
[01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:11.310] for
[01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:11.490] your
[01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:11.750] planner,
[01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.290] but
[01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:12.450] not
[01:07:12.450 --> 01:07:12.670] all
[01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:12.790] of
[01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:12.910] them
[01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:13.090] may
[01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:13.210] be
[01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:13.650] achievable.
[01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:14.590] Especially
[01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:14.750] if
[01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.870] you're
[01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:15.050] trying
[01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:15.170] to
[01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.370] achieve
[01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:15.530] a
[01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:15.770] large
[01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:16.010] number
[01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:16.150] of
[01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.390] preferences
[01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.570] at
[01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:16.690] the
[01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:16.830] same
[01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:17.090] time,
[01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:17.190] you
[01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.310] may
[01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:17.410] not
[01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:17.710] actually
[01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:17.870] be
[01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.950] able
[01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:18.090] to
[01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:18.470] achieve
[01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:19.110] all
[01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:19.250] of
[01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:19.450] those.
[01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:19.970] So
[01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:20.170] how
[01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:20.310] do
[01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:20.590] we
[01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:21.570] reduce
[01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:21.790] our
[01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:22.130] set
[01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.890] in
[01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:23.010] the
[01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:23.290] preferred
[01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.450] order,
[01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:24.990] so
[01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.110] that
[01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:25.270] our
[01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.510] planner
[01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.730] is
[01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:26.630] indeed
[01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.730] the
[01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:26.890] most
[01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:27.170] preferred
[01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.450] planner?
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:28.840] That's
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:28.940] what
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:29.540] APFs
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:29.680] allow
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:29.800] you
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:29.900] to
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:30.100] do.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:30.620] So
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:30.920] basically,
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.200] you
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:31.360] can
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:31.840] express,
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:32.660] using
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:32.920] this
[01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:33.640] preference
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.200] operator.
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:35.380] I
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:35.520] want
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:35.640] to
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:35.960] satisfy
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.380] both
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:36.520] of
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:36.660] these.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:37.220] First,
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:37.360] I
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:37.440] want
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:37.520] to
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:37.680] try
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:37.780] and
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.040] satisfy
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:38.400] both
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:38.500] of
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:38.660] these
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:38.800] in
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:38.880] the
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.180] previous
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:39.480] slide.
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:40.380] And
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:40.520] then,
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:40.620] if
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:40.760] I
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.180] can't,
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:41.540] I
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:41.660] want
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:41.720] to
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:42.080] relax
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:42.240] it,
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:42.340] so
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:42.440] I
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:42.600] only
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:42.940] satisfy
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:43.520] G2.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.040] And
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:44.160] if
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:44.260] I
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:44.460] can't
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:44.560] do
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:44.820] that,
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.020] then
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:45.100] I
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:45.220] want
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:45.280] to
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:45.540] relax
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:45.660] it,
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:45.780] so
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:45.880] I
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.040] only
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:46.260] try
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:46.380] and
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:46.600] satisfy
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.140] G1.
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:47.600] So
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:47.720] that
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:47.920] gives
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.060] the
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:48.260] planner
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:48.380] the
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:48.640] order
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:48.820] in
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:49.060] which
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:49.780] things
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:49.960] are
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.280] relaxed.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.120] And
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:51.240] it's
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:51.520] important
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:51.800] here
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.080] that
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:52.700] if
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:52.800] you
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.040] have
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:53.220] two
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:53.680] situations
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:53.920] where
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.020] you
[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:54.300] can't
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:54.640] distinguish
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:54.780] from
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:54.980] another,
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:55.180] or
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:55.260] you
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:55.420] don't
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:55.600] really
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:55.940] care,
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:56.420] we
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:56.740] establish
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.080] some
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:57.360] order.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:57.580] So
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:57.700] at
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:57.800] the
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.140] very
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.700] lowest
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:07:59.940] type
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.060] of
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:00.260] level,
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:00.420] we
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:00.540] can
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:00.700] just
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:01.100] sort
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:01.260] them
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:01.800] alphabetically
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:01.940] or
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:02.180] something,
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:02.360] to
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:02.520] just
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:02.800] provide
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.120] some
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:03.340] sort
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:03.440] of
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:03.640] order
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:03.820] for
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:03.940] the
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:04.120] planner.
[01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:07.970] OK,
[01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:08.330] so
[01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:08.490] this
[01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:08.570] is
[01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:08.730] just
[01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:08.830] a
[01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:09.130] review
[01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:09.290] of
[01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:09.410] what
[01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.530] I've
[01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:09.630] been
[01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.870] talking
[01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:10.130] about.
[01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.490] So
[01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:11.710] PDFs
[01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.790] at
[01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:11.890] the
[01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:12.090] lowest
[01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:12.350] level,
[01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:12.570] which
[01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:13.470] express
[01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:14.010] temporally
[01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:14.370] extended
[01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:15.050] propositions,
[01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.650] we
[01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.750] can
[01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.950] apply
[01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:16.410] preferences
[01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:16.690] to
[01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:16.970] those
[01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:17.290] using
[01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:18.610] APFs.
[01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:18.990] Then
[01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:19.130] we
[01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:19.630] can
[01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:20.110] combine
[01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.570] or
[01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:21.390] join
[01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:22.790] APFs
[01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:23.030] using
[01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:24.090] general
[01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:24.410] preference
[01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.710] formulas.
[01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:25.430] And
[01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.670] finally,
[01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:25.830] we
[01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:25.990] can
[01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.410] activate
[01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:26.630] those
[01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.950] preference
[01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:27.210] formulas
[01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:27.590] to
[01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:29.530] determine
[01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:29.750] the
[01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:29.930] order
[01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:30.050] in
[01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.190] which
[01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:30.330] you
[01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:31.730] should
[01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:32.290] relax
[01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:32.430] the
[01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.930] propositions
[01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:33.730] to
[01:08:33.730 --> 01:08:33.950] allow
[01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:34.210] yourself
[01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:34.390] to
[01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.550] find
[01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.670] a
[01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:34.830] plan.
[01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.990] So
[01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.330] using
[01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:36.670] this
[01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:37.430] scheme
[01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.970] in
[01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:38.270] MDP,
[01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:39.270] we're
[01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:39.510] using
[01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.810] both
[01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:39.970] the
[01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:40.450] LTL
[01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:41.890] syntax
[01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:42.210] and
[01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:42.390] rules
[01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.490] that
[01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:42.570] we
[01:08:42.570 --> 01:08:42.770] talked
[01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:42.930] about
[01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:43.050] in
[01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:43.070] the
[01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.230] first
[01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:43.590] section
[01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:44.110] to
[01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:44.450] express
[01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.890] temporally
[01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:45.330] extended
[01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:45.890] preferences.
[01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:46.870] And
[01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.970] the
[01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:47.190] planner
[01:08:47.190 --> 01:08:47.470] that's
[01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.730] actually
[01:08:47.730 --> 01:08:48.190] used
[01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:48.590] to
[01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:49.870] solve
[01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:50.130] these
[01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:50.330] types
[01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:50.450] of
[01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:50.670] problems
[01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:50.830] is
[01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:51.050] called
[01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.250] P
[01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:51.450]-Plan.
[01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.690] And
[01:08:51.690 --> 01:08:51.830] P
[01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:51.990]-Plan
[01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.190] can
[01:08:52.190 --> 01:08:52.390] actually
[01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.690] handle
[01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:53.010] temporally
[01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:53.190] extended
[01:08:53.190 --> 01:08:53.530] preferences
[01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:53.870] and
[01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.990] the
[01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.210] goal
[01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:54.350] at
[01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:54.450] the
[01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:54.590] end
[01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.770] as
[01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:54.950] well.
[01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.730] And
[01:08:55.730 --> 01:08:55.830] it
[01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:56.050] does
[01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:56.550] basically
[01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.950] a
[01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:57.710] best
[01:08:57.710 --> 01:08:57.930] first
[01:08:57.930 --> 01:08:58.230] search

[01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.690] It
[01:08:59.690 --> 01:08:59.910] actually
[01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:00.090] is
[01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:00.670] one
[01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:00.750] of
[01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:00.790] the

[01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.270] that
[01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:01.490] uses
[01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:01.710] the
[01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:01.910] left
[01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:02.210] branch
[01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:02.330] of
[01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:02.450] what
[01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:02.690] Marlies
[01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:03.010] showed.
[01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:03.130] It
[01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:03.290] uses
[01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:03.790] progression
[01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:04.350] to

[01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:08.010] whether
[01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:08.250] you've
[01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:08.590] satisfied
[01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.870] those
[01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:09.150] formulas
[01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:09.370] or
[01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:09.610] not.
[01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:09.770] And
[01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:09.890] if
[01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:10.090] not,
[01:09:10.150 --> 01:09:10.190] it
[01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:10.270] will
[01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:10.490] push
[01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.610] them
[01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.690] to
[01:09:10.690 --> 01:09:10.810] the
[01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:10.990] next
[01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.250] state
[01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:13.230] so
[01:09:13.230 --> 01:09:13.510] that
[01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.630] in
[01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.750] the
[01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:13.910] next
[01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:14.050] state,
[01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.130] it
[01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:14.230] can
[01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:14.570] evaluate
[01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:14.830] whether
[01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:15.030] you've
[01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.330] satisfied
[01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:15.550] those
[01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.750] formulas.
[01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:16.450] And
[01:09:16.450 --> 01:09:16.650] that's
[01:09:16.650 --> 01:09:16.750] how
[01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:16.890] it
[01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:18.190] improves
[01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:18.530] the
[01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.730] search
[01:09:18.730 --> 01:09:19.070] space
[01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.370] and
[01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:19.630] tries
[01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.870] to
[01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:20.490] always
[01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:20.710] find
[01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:20.830] the
[01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:20.950] most
[01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:21.270] preferred
[01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:21.550] plan
[01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.690] to
[01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:21.850] meet
[01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:21.990] your
[01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.170] goal.
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:24.400] All
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:24.600] right.
[01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.470] So
[01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.870] that's
[01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.970] our
[01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:27.290] presentation.
[01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:28.650] Any
[01:09:28.650 --> 01:09:29.070] questions
[01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.310] for
[01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:29.490] anyone?
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:37.340] I
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:37.500] have
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:37.580] a
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:37.760] question
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:37.980] about
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:38.160] the
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:38.540] release
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:38.920] notation.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:39.820] Do
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:39.940] you
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:40.120] guys
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:40.400] write
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:40.980] leave
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:41.160] or
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:41.580] road
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:41.920] and
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.060] then
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:42.160] a
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:42.480] relief?
[01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:44.050] Would
[01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:44.130] you
[01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:44.470] say
[01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.950] that
[01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:46.150] omega
[01:09:46.150 --> 01:09:46.490] has
[01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.650] to
[01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:46.850] hold
[01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:47.130] its
[01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:50.270] objection
[01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:50.450] in
[01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:50.650] one
[01:09:50.650 --> 01:09:50.910] state?
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:52.020] So
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:52.760] omega
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.160] doesn't
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:53.400] have
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:53.600] to
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:53.920] hold
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.420] until
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:54.800] P
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.100] happens.
[01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:56.050] Omega
[01:09:56.050 --> 01:09:56.370] just
[01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:56.530] has
[01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:56.730] to
[01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:56.930] hold
[01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:57.170] at
[01:09:57.170 --> 01:09:57.330] the
[01:09:57.330 --> 01:09:57.690] last
[01:09:57.690 --> 01:09:58.010] state.
[01:09:58.930 --> 01:09:59.370] So
[01:09:59.370 --> 01:09:59.810] essentially
[01:09:59.810 --> 01:09:59.990] what
[01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.110] I'm
[01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.430] saying
[01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.670] is
[01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:01.130] omega
[01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.830] releases
[01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:02.170] P.
[01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:02.410] So
[01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:02.650] once
[01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:02.930] omega
[01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:03.430] happens,
[01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:04.090] P
[01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:04.330] has
[01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:04.490] to
[01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.710] happen
[01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:04.870] at
[01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:05.030] that
[01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.230] state.
[01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.730] And
[01:10:05.730 --> 01:10:05.950] then
[01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:06.230] omega
[01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:06.510] has
[01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:07.270] released
[01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.430] P.
[01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.490] And
[01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.530] it's
[01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:07.630] like,
[01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:07.890] OK,
[01:10:08.190 --> 01:10:08.350] now
[01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.450] it
[01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:08.690] happens.
[01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:08.930] So
[01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:09.130] P,
[01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:09.290] you
[01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.410] can
[01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:09.550] do
[01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:09.750] whatever
[01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.970] you
[01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:10.230] want.
[01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:10.370] You
[01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.470] can
[01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.590] be
[01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:10.790] true.
[01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.910] You
[01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:11.010] can
[01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:11.130] be
[01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:11.430] false.
[01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:13.290] Sorry.
[01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:13.530] So
[01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:13.810] P
[01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:14.050] has
[01:10:14.050 --> 01:10:14.210] to
[01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:14.450] hold
[01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:15.670] until
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:16.300] omega
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:16.780] happens.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:17.140] Yep.
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:17.380] And
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:17.520] then
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:17.780] omega
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.540] releases
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:18.780] P.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.140] So
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:19.260] the
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:19.680] definition
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:19.980] is
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:20.160] just
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:20.600] switched,
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.160] maybe.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:22.880] So
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.160] this
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:23.320] is
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:23.500] the
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:23.960] notation.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:24.220] It
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:24.360] is
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:24.460] the
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:24.720] notation
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:24.900] that
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:24.940] you
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:25.120] have
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:25.640] P,
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:26.760] R,
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.300] omega.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:29.620] But
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:29.980] what
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:30.560] do
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:30.680] you
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:30.700] believe?
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:30.820] It's
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:30.980] just
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:31.120] the
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:31.340] definition.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.360] This
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:32.600] should
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:32.780] be
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:32.960] P.
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:33.200] This
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:33.360] should
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:33.500] be
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:33.720] A.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:34.640] That's
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:34.740] all
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:34.800] I
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:34.940] was
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:35.120] wondering.
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:35.440] Because
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:35.620] then
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:35.720] I
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.020] saw
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:36.180] that
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:36.260] I
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:36.400] was
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:36.760] confused.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.000] So
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:37.300] that's
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:37.440] all.
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:37.760] OK.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.100] Sorry.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:38.440] That's
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:38.620] fine.
[01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:44.970] Any
[01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:45.150] other
[01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:45.450] questions?
[01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.470] Well,
[01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.590] it
[01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.790] seems
[01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:49.010] there
[01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.310] are
[01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:50.110] multiple
[01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:50.510] ways
[01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.750] to
[01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:51.210] express
[01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:51.490] the
[01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:51.850] same
[01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:52.410] formula.
[01:10:56.290 --> 01:10:56.730] Is
[01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:56.930] there
[01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:57.330] any
[01:10:57.330 --> 01:10:57.750] notion
[01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:58.170] of
[01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:58.770] canonical
[01:10:58.770 --> 01:10:59.290] form
[01:10:59.290 --> 01:10:59.930] or
[01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:01.370] at
[01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.530] least
[01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:02.070] complicated
[01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.430] form
[01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.610] or
[01:11:02.610 --> 01:11:02.810] something
[01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:03.050] like
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:03.460] that?
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:04.280] Yeah,
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:04.520] there
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:04.780] is.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:05.180] Typically,
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:06.820] they
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.360] actually,
[01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:09.890] on
[01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:10.070] this
[01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.250] slide.
[01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.430] So
[01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.790] to
[01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:12.070] simplify
[01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.310] the
[01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.810] algorithms,
[01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:13.630] they
[01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.910] typically
[01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:14.390] apply
[01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.570] the
[01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.750] kind
[01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.910] of
[01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:15.490] reductions
[01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:15.750] that
[01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.850] we
[01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:16.070] showed
[01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.210] in
[01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:16.290] the
[01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:16.550] slide
[01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.750] to
[01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:17.090] reduce
[01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.310] the
[01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.810] release
[01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:17.970] and
[01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:18.050] the
[01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.410] globally
[01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.690] and
[01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:19.050] the
[01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:19.350] future
[01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.750] down
[01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.950] to
[01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:20.150] just
[01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:20.310] the
[01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.590] until
[01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:20.750] and
[01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.790] the
[01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:21.010] next.
[01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.510] That
[01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.710] allows
[01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:21.850] your
[01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:22.190] algorithms
[01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:22.370] to
[01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.430] be
[01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.550] a
[01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.670] little
[01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:22.810] bit
[01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:23.050] more,
[01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:23.710] to
[01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:23.930] handle
[01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:24.150] fewer
[01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:24.510] cases.
[01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:25.250] And
[01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.370] then
[01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:25.490] they
[01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.770] apply
[01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:25.930] the
[01:11:25.930 --> 01:11:26.150] usual
[01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:26.450] rules,
[01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:26.670] trying
[01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:26.810] to
[01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:26.970] push
[01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:27.330] knots
[01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:27.670] out
[01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:27.830] to
[01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.910] the
[01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:28.050] left
[01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:28.210]-hand
[01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:28.570] side.
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:41.360] All
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:41.520] right.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.240] Thanks,
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:42.440] everyone.
