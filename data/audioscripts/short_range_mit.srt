[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.120] and
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.520] 16,
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.900] dealing

[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.300] So
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.860] let's
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.020] go

[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.660] start.
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.240] In
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.560] this
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.720] session,
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.040] we
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.120] are
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.280] going

[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.820] And
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.660] basically,
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.020] I
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.180] will
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.440] give
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.600] a

[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.100] that
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.200] are
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.520] usually
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.900] made

[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.440] and
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.640] also
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.940] worldwide.
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.200] And
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.480] then
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.040] we
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.240] will
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.760] briefly
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.080] talk
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.460] about

[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.740] standards
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.060] and
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.560] guidelines
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.820] that
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.240] are
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.180] published
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.640] and
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.460] used
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.900] by
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.840] transit
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.360] agencies
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.060] to
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.460] plan
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.700] their
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.300] service
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.220] based
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.420] on
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.700] those.
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.040] Then
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.720] we
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.840] will
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.360] also
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.720] talk
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.120] about
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.020] current
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.560] practice
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.740] and

[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.380] existing
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.120] systems.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.200] Probably
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.460] we
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.660] will
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.640] cover
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.820] item
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.220] 1
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.600] and
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.300] some

[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.560] 2
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.840] this
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.180] week.
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.820] And
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.100] then
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.580] the
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.820] rest
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.160] will
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.320] actually
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.280] be
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.900] delivered
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.320] to
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.680] you

[00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.670] And
[00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:23.190] it
[00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.570] basically
[00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.890] needs

[00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.610] basically
[00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.290] involves

[00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.490] One

[00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.390] two,
[00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.810] although,
[00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.150] are

[00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.010] important

[00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.510] But
[00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.810] these
[00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.270] decisions
[00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.550] are
[00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.990] usually
[00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.430] done

[00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.990] long
[00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.210] range
[00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.030] decisions
[00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.330] are
[00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.630] usually
[00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.070] done

[00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.090] So

[00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.730] authority
[00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.930] is

[00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.210] case.
[00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.790] And
[00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.930] it
[00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.230] needs
[00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.690] close

[00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.950] the
[00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:00.190] final
[00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.690] decisions.
[00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.410] So
[00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.670] that's
[00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.930] about

[00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.310] is

[00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.090] somehow
[00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.630] similar.
[00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.050] It's
[00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.290] usually,
[00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.510] for

[00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.870] is
[00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.010] a

[00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.030] that
[00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.290] deals
[00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.590] with

[00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.130] Because
[00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.230] what
[00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.710] happens
[00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.910] in

[00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.690] is
[00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.070] that

[00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:33.050] And
[00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.430] it's
[00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.730] usually
[00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.130] rare
[00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:35.890] or
[00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:36.390] impossible
[00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.910] that
[00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.290] we
[00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.610] start

[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.640] So
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.020] therefore,
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.260] what

[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.780] that
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:56.880] are
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.220] related
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.500] to
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.760] that.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.140] Yes,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.340] please.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.120] In
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.500] terms
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.660] of
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.880] fleet
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.300] size,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:02.880] could
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.100] that
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.340] come
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.480] as
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.640] a
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.080] request
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.280] from
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.420] the
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.780] agency?
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.420] An
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.800] agency
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.140] says,
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.500] we
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.580] have
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.720] a
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.860] bus
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.160] line.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.640] It's
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.860] at
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.320] capacity
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.460] or
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.120] overcapacity.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.740] We
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:09.900] need
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.060] more
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.360] buses.
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.020] Could
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.160] it
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.360] come
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.820] from
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:11.960] a
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.300] request
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.480] to
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.860] the
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.100] higher
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.500] level?
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.340] Yes,
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.860] definitely,
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.260] yeah.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.060] But
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.640] it
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.000] eventually
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.720] requires
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.880] the
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.780] interaction
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.320] and
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.900] also
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.580] the
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.140] securing
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.440] of
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.800] funding
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.120] from
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.480] the

[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.780] governmental
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.340] agencies.
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.180] So
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.380] yeah.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:30.480] Yeah.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.760] So
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.460] the
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.860] reason
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.200] that
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.620] I'm
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.040] explaining
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.360] this
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.600] is
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:36.780] that
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.140] I
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.540] like
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.000] for
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.200] you
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.480] to
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.280] understand
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:39.780] why
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:39.980] we
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.200] are
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.860] focusing
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.160] on
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.480] short
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.760]-range
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.600] decision
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.960]-making
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.220] and

[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:44.660] in
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:44.880] this
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.200] course.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.420] That's
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.660] mainly
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.160] because
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.140] the
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.620] bulk
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.180] part
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.380] of

[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.100] at

[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.840] agencies
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.180] is
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.560] related
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.860] to
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.360] short

[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.220]-making.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.480] So
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.060] what
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.280] we
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.500] mean
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:07:59.680] by

[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:00.720]-making
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.180] are

[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.060] that
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.200] are
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:02.560] usually
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:02.980] made

[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:06.960] basis.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:07.900] And
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.720] they
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.240] basically
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.200] entail
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.680] decisions
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.200] about

[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.840] decisions
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.300] about

[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.400] optimization.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.220] And
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.160] these
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.300] are
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:53.680] basically

[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.300] So
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.760] then
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.920] there
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.240] is

[00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.870] it
[00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.070] is
[00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:12.490] possible
[00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:12.970] to

[00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:25.770] however,
[00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:26.150] the
[00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.490] practice
[00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:26.710] has
[00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:27.030] shown

[00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.070] there
[00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:28.170] is
[00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:28.310] a

[00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:35.810] sure
[00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:36.150] that
[00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.310] you're

[00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:44.850] and
[00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.610] you're
[00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:47.810] finding
[00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.030] a

[00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:58.710] constraints
[00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.050] and
[00:12:59.050 --> 00:12:59.750] some
[00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.950] of
[00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:00.710] the

[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.220] concerns
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:04.700] are
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.060] usually
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.860] difficult
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.400] to
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.940] formulate
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.640] into
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.700] optimization
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.480] problems.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:10.800] But
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:10.960] there
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.420] are
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.320] published
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:12.900] guidelines

[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.440] that
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:16.620] you
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:16.900] can
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.500] basically
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:17.920] follow
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.120] and
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.340] make
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:18.560] sure

[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.880] at
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.060] least
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:20.240] the
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:20.480] top

[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.060] level
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:21.680] of
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.080] the

[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.260] tasks
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:25.740] here
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.480] are
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.500] basically
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:27.840] done
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.000] to
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.620] the

[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:29.720] level.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:30.940] So
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.600] let's
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:31.760] go
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:31.880] ahead
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.020] and
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.320] start
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:32.480] and
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:32.780] review
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.080] these
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.440] tasks.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:33.880] There
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.020] are
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.340] lectures
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:34.620] in
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:34.820] this
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:35.120] course
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.320] that
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:35.480] are
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:35.760] dealing
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.580] with
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.280] each
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:37.480] one
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:37.620] of
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:37.920] these
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.580] tasks
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:39.940] and
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:40.680] components
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.340] in
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.140] planning.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:42.860] But
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.080] in
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.460] this
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.680] lecture,
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:44.920] I'll
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.080] just
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.680] briefly
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.200] go
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.500] over
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.060] these
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:47.680] different
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.460] components
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.060] as
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:49.600] an
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.160] introductory
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.440] part
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:51.720] of
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.020] the
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.600] course.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.160] So
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.520] we
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:58.740] will
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.100] have,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:13:59.960] for
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.500] every
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.640] optimization
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.280] problem,
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:02.700] or
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.600] in
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:03.800] this
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.100] case,
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.220] planning
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:05.680] process,
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.340] you
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:06.920] have
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.040] a
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:07.180] set
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:07.340] of
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:07.780] inputs,
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.720] constraints,
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.220] basically,
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:10.900] that
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.040] you
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.200] need
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:11.360] to
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:11.880] satisfy.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.540] And
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:12.780] then
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.280] there
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:13.400] is
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:13.520] an
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.260] objective
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:14.720] function
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:14.920] that
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.060] you
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:15.180] need
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:15.320] to
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:15.700] optimize.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:16.420] So
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.040] inputs,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:17.740] so
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:17.940] the
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.240] first
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.800] component
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.120] of
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.760] the
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.060] planning
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.640] practice
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.160] here
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:25.920] is
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.520] bus
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:26.760] route
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.340] design.
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.140] This
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:28.620] includes
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.260] design
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:30.680] of
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.060] layout
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:31.380] of
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:31.540] the
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:31.800] routes
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.000] and
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.340] layout
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:32.680] of
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:32.980] the
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.980] stops.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.000] And
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.960] basically,
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.220] the
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:37.540] input
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:37.820] into
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.100] this
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:38.540] task
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.520] includes
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.500] constraints
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:40.920] that
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.160] are
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:41.900] related
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.460] to
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:42.920] right
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.120]-of
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.480]-way,
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.040] roadway
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:44.700] constraints.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.100] Like
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.180] if
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:46.360] there
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:46.500] is
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:46.680] a
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:46.860] river
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.080] in
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.200] your
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.540] network,
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:47.860] there's
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.040] this
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.620] connectivity.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.040] There
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.160] are
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:49.540] bridges,
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:49.960] tunnels.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:50.700] So
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.160] these
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:51.340] are
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:51.560] the
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:51.740] kind
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:51.820] of
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.280] constraints
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.400] at
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:53.760] network
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.040] level
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.320] that
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:54.480] you
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:54.620] would
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:54.840] like
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.040] to
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.840] satisfy.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:56.420] And
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:56.600] there's
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:56.860] also
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.380] demand
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:57.860] constraints
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:58.120] in
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.240] the
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:58.600] network
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.260] that
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:14:59.980] you
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.160] need
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:00.300] to
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:00.700] consider
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.040] for
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.260] this
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:01.640] task.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:02.680] Like
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.520] you
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.360] have
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:04.520] a
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:04.780] sense
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.080] of
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.680] what's
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:05.800] the
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.060] demand
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:06.260] from
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:06.640] certain
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.100] suburb
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:07.320] to
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:07.620] the
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.780] downtown
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.280] area.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:09.720] And
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.200] you
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:10.600] basically
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:10.860] would
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.140] like
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:11.380] to
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:11.700] have
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:11.840] a
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.080] route
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.920] system
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:13.520] that
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:13.840] can
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.820] address
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.080] that
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.380] demand
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:16.600] and
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.040] satisfy
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.320] that
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.560] demand.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:18.320] Then
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:18.700] the
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.160] solution
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.420] to
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.460] the
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.160] design
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.680] component
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.080] and
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.320] that
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:23.800] task
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.080] out
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.240] of
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:24.520] routes
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:24.680] and
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:24.940] layout
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:25.100] of
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.500] stops
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.300] that
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.420] are
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.060] basically
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:28.560] resulting
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:28.840] from
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.040] the
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.400] first
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.340] component.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:30.860] And
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.080] then
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.500] the
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:32.960] set
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.120] of
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.420] routes
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.080] and
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.560] stops
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:34.840] will
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.000] be
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.420] input
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:35.920] into
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.400] the
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:36.740] second
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.180] task,
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.200] which
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.500] is
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.040] setting
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.100] timetables.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:40.680] This
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.160] task
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.020] includes
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.200] finding
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.940] frequencies
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.300] for
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:44.500] the
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:44.800] routes.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:45.380] And
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:45.900] from
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.280] that,
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.580] identifying
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:47.960] and
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.920] basically
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.460] generating
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:51.660] the
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.160] timetables
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.480] based
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:52.660] on
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.340] frequencies.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:54.660] There
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:54.780] are
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.160] usually
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.280] considerations
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:56.960] related
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.520] to
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.480] policy
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.120] headways,

[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.180] frequencies,
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:00.940] and
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.620] capacity
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.700] frequencies
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.020] that
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:03.300] need
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:03.540] to
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.580] be
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.580] addressed
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:05.940] in
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.120] this
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:06.460] task.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.260] But
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:07.640] again,
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:08.800] this
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.100] task
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:09.300] is
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:09.800] also
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.400] somehow
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.620] dealt
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:12.940] with
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.900] using
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.240] the

[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.280] guidelines
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:15.600] and
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:15.840] just
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.520] satisfying
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:16.820] these
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.280] guidelines.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:18.360] The
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:18.940] input
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.440] and
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:19.680] other
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.180] constraints
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:20.360] that
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:20.880] are
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.900] considered
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.200] for
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:22.440] this
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:22.720] task
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:22.920] would
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.160] be
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.600] level
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:23.800] of

[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:24.760] guidelines
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.100] and,
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:25.400] again,
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:25.840] the
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.340] demand
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.120] constraints
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:28.300] in
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:28.400] the
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.780] network.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.540] Then
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:30.880] from
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.180] the
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:31.440] set
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:31.580] of
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.200] timetables,
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.100] what
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.520] will
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.000] be
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.480] resulted
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:35.840] here
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.120] is
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:36.360] the
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:36.740] departure
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.280] times
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:37.720] that
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:37.820] are
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.240] scheduled

[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:40.800] So
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.700] the
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.020] first
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:42.580] two

[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:45.560] row
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:45.860] two
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.380] basically
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:46.960] are
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.340] dealing
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:47.900] with
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.920] satisfying
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:49.240] the

[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:49.700] and
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.120] satisfying
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.440] the
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:50.840] guidelines.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:51.440] But
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:51.760] once
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.120] you
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.120] go
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.700] beyond
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.080] the

[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:55.640] it
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.100] becomes
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:56.300] to
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:56.480] the
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:56.720] level
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.000] that
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.300] you
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:57.680] know
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.700] what's
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:58.880] the
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.220] service
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:16:59.580] you
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:16:59.920] want
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.160] to
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.520] deliver.
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.160] And
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:01.300] then
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:01.580] you're
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:01.800] dealing
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.040] with
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:02.460] tactical
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.020] decision,
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.280] how
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:03.500] you
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:03.700] can
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.440] optimize
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:04.760] the
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.040] cost
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.180] of
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:05.540] delivering

[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:08.060] service
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:08.700] and
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.020] improve
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:09.620] efficiency.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.280] So
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.560] the
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.000] third
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.040] row
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.400] here
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.140] basically
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.560] deals
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:13.900] with
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.640] the

[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:19.640] and
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:19.940] for

[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:22.640] And
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:22.800] then
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.060] what
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:23.200] you
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.340] need
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:23.520] to
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:23.680] do
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:23.840] is
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.140] how
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.300] you
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:24.540] want

[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:27.760] in
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.020] terms
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:28.200] of
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:28.700] allocate
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.500] the

[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.200] So
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:41.660] that
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:41.860] would
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.080] be

[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:53.680] of
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.180] scheduling
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:54.840] drivers
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.380] to
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:55.820] deliver
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:56.300] the
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.740] service.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.100] And
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:58.200] the
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:58.500] result
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:58.740] would
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:58.900] be
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.180] the
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:18:59.740] schedules
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.080] for
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.260] the
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:00.480] crew.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:03.960] So
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.300] then
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.400] these
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:05.880] decisions
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.160] can
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.720] be
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:06.940] looked
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.640] at
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:07.980] in
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.100] another
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:09.460] way
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:09.760] too.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.020] We
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:11.260] can
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:11.840] further
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.340] classify
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:12.620] these
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.040] decisions
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.400] into
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.480] service
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:14.840] planning
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.260] decisions
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:15.480] and
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:15.920] operational
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.400] planning
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:16.820] decision.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.360] Service
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:18.680] planning
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.180] decisions
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:19.480] would
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:19.820] be
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:20.340] the
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:20.760] decisions
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.040] that
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:21.420] define
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:21.960] service
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.200] as
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:22.340] it
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:22.560] is
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:22.940] perceived
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:23.140] and
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.580] understood
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.080] by
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.440] public.
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:26.900] This
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.040] is
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.460] basically
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:27.840] the
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.520] part
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:28.680] of
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.060] service
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:29.320] that
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:29.500] is
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:29.840] visible
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.120] to
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.460] the
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:30.880] public.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:32.740] And
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:32.900] then
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.100] there
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:33.180] are
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:33.560] decisions
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:33.780] that
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:33.880] are
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.200] related
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:34.600] to
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.420] operations,
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:35.920] which
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.600] basically
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.040] defines
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.280] how
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:37.900] operations
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.460] occur
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:38.680] to
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.100] produce
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.300] the
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:39.680] service.
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:40.460] This
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:40.640] is
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.060] somehow
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:41.580] a
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:41.840] black
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.140] box
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:42.480] to
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.100] the
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:43.580] users,
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.040] I
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:44.180] mean,
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:44.280] to
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:44.520] the
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.120] passengers.
[00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.000] And
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.580] basically,
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:49.860] the
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.280] passengers
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:51.620] should
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:51.880] not
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.460] really
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:52.940] care
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.580] what's
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:53.780] the

[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:54.560] schedule
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.280] and
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:55.780] what's
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:55.960] the
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.180] crew
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:56.580] schedule
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.060] that
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.200] is
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:57.580] assigned
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:57.840] to
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.600] the
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:58.860] trip
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:19:59.120] as
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:19:59.320] long
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:19:59.520] as
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:19:59.960] trip
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.240] is
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.640] being
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.000] delivered
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.280] as

[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:01.540] is
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:01.960] scheduled.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:05.600] So
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:05.780] in
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.020] terms
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:06.400] of

[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.080] decisions,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.040] we
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.580] basically,
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.480] for

[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:24.500] that
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:24.640] are
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.080] involved
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:25.280] in
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:25.760] planning
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.980] basically,
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:28.840] starting
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.140] from

[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.300] for
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:21.780] solving
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.180] these
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:22.780] planning
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.200] decision
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:23.500] making
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.060] processes
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.420] are
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.100] basically
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.040] ranging
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.440] from
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.800] judgment
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.160] and
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:31.520] manual
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:31.940] analysis
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.340] that
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:33.500] is
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:33.680] more
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.100] dominated
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:34.660] into
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.380] computer
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.000] tools
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.220] that
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:36.400] are
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.220] basically
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.580] designed
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:38.820] to
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.140] solve
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:39.600] optimization
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.240] problems
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.800] for

[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:42.600] the
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:42.960] cost.
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:47.780] So
[00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:49.170] similar
[00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:49.490] to
[00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:49.690] the
[00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:50.390] classical
[00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:51.050] evaluation
[00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:51.590] structure,
[00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.230] when
[00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.430] you're
[00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.690] dealing
[00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:52.990] with
[00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:54.070] planning
[00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.870] questions
[00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:56.210] and
[00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.570] planning
[00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:57.550] projects
[00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.910] or
[00:21:58.910 --> 00:21:59.210] planning
[00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.010] alternatives,
[00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:01.630] there
[00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.750] is
[00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.030] this
[00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.150] structure
[00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:03.410] that
[00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:03.750] starts
[00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.970] with
[00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:04.290] goals,
[00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.790] objective
[00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:05.290] measures,
[00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.570] and
[00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:06.130] standards
[00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.410] or
[00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:06.830] guidelines.
[00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:07.610] So
[00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:08.130] let's
[00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.630] just
[00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.150] make
[00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:10.270] a
[00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:10.470] quick
[00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.090] practice
[00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.930] and
[00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.370] define
[00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:14.510] a
[00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.770] goal
[00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:15.430] and
[00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.710] then
[00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.170] define
[00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:16.610] objectives
[00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:16.850] for
[00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:17.050] that
[00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.390] goal,
[00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:18.090] define
[00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:18.510] measures
[00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.990] based
[00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.150] on
[00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:19.510] that,
[00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:20.310] and
[00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.050] see
[00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:21.610] how
[00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.750] a
[00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.970] standard
[00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:23.250] can
[00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:23.430] be
[00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.950] defined
[00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.750] to
[00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.470] make
[00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.850] that
[00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:32.070] planning
[00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.830] decision
[00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.510] acceptable.
[00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.050] So
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.160] let's
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:40.500] define
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:40.640] a
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:40.840] goal.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.300] Does
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:49.580] anyone
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.020] have
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:50.240] any
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:50.680] suggestions?
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:51.740] What
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.100] is
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.060] an
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:55.400] important
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:55.680] goal
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:55.880] for
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.180] public
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:56.780] transportation
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.340] system?
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.040] Maximize
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.540] ridership,
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:01.820] yes.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:03.100] So
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.560] let's
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:03.800] say
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.720] we
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:04.960] want
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.120] to
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:05.880] maximize
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.520] ridership.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.500] That's
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:10.640] your
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:10.900] research
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:11.280] problem,
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:11.540] right?
[00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:12.800] It's
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:12.960] just
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.140] a
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:13.380] cool
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:13.580] term.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.280] Right.
[00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.480] So
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:16.740] then
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.300] in
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:17.500] terms
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:17.660] of
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.300] objectives,
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.220] what
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:19.440] would
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.320] be
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:20.460] an
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:20.820] objective
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.080] that
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:21.200] we
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:21.360] can
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:21.720] define
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:21.920] for
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.220] this?
[00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.960] I
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.120] would
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:26.400] say
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.100] probably
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:27.560] the
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.020] peak
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.400] hour
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.640] demand
[00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.980] could
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.140] be
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:32.380] one
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.000] objective,
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.020] or
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:34.220] peak
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:34.420] hour
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.000] ridership
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.200] in
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:35.480] certain
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:35.940] corridor.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:36.960] Let's
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.240] say
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.100] peak
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:39.980] hour
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.520] ridership
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.460] per
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:46.940] weekday,
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.180] per
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:47.540] month.
[00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.110] Well,
[00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:57.330] peak
[00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:57.510] hour
[00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.010] ridership
[00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:58.230] would
[00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.410] be
[00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:58.830] the
[00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.350] objective
[00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.830] here,
[00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:00.290] and
[00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:00.410] then
[00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:00.570] the
[00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:00.830] measure
[00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.090] that
[00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:01.210] you
[00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:01.370] would
[00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.790] define
[00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:02.050] would
[00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:02.630] be
[00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.230] peak
[00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.490] hour
[00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.130] ridership
[00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.590] per
[00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.010] weekday,
[00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.230] per
[00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.550] month.
[00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:06.310] And
[00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.550] then
[00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.350] the
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.480] standard
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:11.760] that
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:11.940] you
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.220] want
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.680] to
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.920] define
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.460] would
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:16.800] be
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.500] something
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:17.920] that
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.320] not
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:20.620] only
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.140] captures
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.760] the
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.100] demand
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:23.480] side,
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:23.660] but
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.000] also
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.580] the
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:24.920] supply
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.280] of
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:25.440] the
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:25.780] system,
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.040] too.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.260] So
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:26.420] you
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:26.620] would
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.120] come
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:27.300] up
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:27.500] with
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.320] probably
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:29.680] like,
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:30.860] I
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.040] would
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:31.280] like.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:31.800] Vehicle
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.480] riders
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:32.960] per
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.620] person.
[00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:36.290] Yeah,
[00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:36.710] exactly.
[00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:36.990] Or
[00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.630] let's
[00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.810] say
[00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:38.110] like
[00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.810] 60
[00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:39.090]%
[00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:39.390] of
[00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:39.930] capacity.
[00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.470] Like
[00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:42.490] your
[00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.850] standard
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:46.480] in
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:46.660] this
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:46.900] case
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.140] would
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:47.360] be
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.620] your
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.320] peak
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:50.540] hour
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.020] ridership
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:51.200] should
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:51.380] be
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:51.680] greater
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.020] than
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:52.800] 60
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.100]%
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.920] of
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.260] capacity.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.000] So
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.400] this
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:57.580] was
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:57.760] just
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:57.920] an
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.220] example
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:58.420] that
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:58.560] we
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:58.820] tried
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.020] to
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:24:59.280] work
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:24:59.480] out
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:24:59.780] one
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.100] practice
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.500] for
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.100] evaluation
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:02.800] structure.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.320] But
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:03.480] let
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:03.580] me
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:03.760] give
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:03.860] you
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.120] another
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.520] example
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:04.740] that
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:04.920] is
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.320] actually
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:05.880] used
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.340] in
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:07.640] the
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.280] practice.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.140] So
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.500] assume
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:13.740] that
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.180] we
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:14.320] are
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:14.780] considering
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:14.980] the
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:15.300] goal
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:15.660] of
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.960] reliability
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.660] in
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:18.760] the
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.040] transit
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.540] system.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.260] The
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:20.440] goal
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:20.580] of
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.120] reliability
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.260] would
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:23.460] be
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.000] considered
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.340] one
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:25.480] of
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:25.600] the
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:25.800] main
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.160] goals,
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:26.640] because
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.240] if
[00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:32.570] we
[00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.730] have
[00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:32.850] a
[00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:33.190] reliable
[00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.550] public
[00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:33.890] transport
[00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.490] system,
[00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:35.110] you
[00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.710] can
[00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.610] secure
[00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:38.030] and
[00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.210] you
[00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:38.590] can
[00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.170] guarantee
[00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:40.470] a
[00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.690] body
[00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:41.090] of
[00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.030] demand
[00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:42.270] in
[00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:42.430] your
[00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.830] network
[00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.110] that
[00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.470] can
[00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.870] rely
[00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:44.070] on
[00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.250] your
[00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:44.590] transit
[00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.570] system
[00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:47.190] and
[00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.170] basically
[00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:52.250] adapt
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.780] to
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.140] the
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.180] lifestyle
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.420] of
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:56.700] using
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.020] public
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.620] transport.
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:57.980] And
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.280] that's
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.100] beneficial
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.420] to
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:01.580] the
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:01.940] system
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:03.860] from
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.580] different
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.080] perspectives.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.200] So
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.360] the
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:07.740] objective
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.000] that
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.140] we
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:08.280] can
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:08.660] rely,
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:09.800] that
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:09.920] we
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.060] can
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:10.400] define
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:10.620] for
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.080] reliability
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:11.540] in
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:11.720] this
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.100] case,
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:12.680] would
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.040] be
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.760] possibly.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:15.900] Can
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:16.020] you
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:16.160] come
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:16.300] up
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:16.420] with
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:16.620] some
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.020] objective
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.280] that
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:17.400] we
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:17.540] can
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:17.940] define
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.680] with
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.240] the
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:20.460] goal
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:20.780] of
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.340] improving
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.080] reliability?
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:22.780] On
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:22.940]-time
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.400] performance,
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:24.680] yes.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:30.540] So
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:30.740] on
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:30.900]-time
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.300] performance
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:31.660] would
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.300] be
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.700] the
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:34.140] objective.
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.120] And
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:35.360] then
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.620] we
[00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.910] need
[00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:37.050] to
[00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:37.390] define
[00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:37.550] a
[00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:37.790] measure
[00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:38.070] for
[00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.410] this
[00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:38.970] to
[00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:39.130] be
[00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:39.390] able
[00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.510] to
[00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:41.810] measure
[00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:42.150] that
[00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:42.570] objective
[00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:42.950] for
[00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:43.150] each
[00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:43.330] one
[00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:43.490] of
[00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.810] the
[00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:45.790] scenarios
[00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:46.150] and
[00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:46.310] for
[00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.470] each
[00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.650] one
[00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:46.830] of
[00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:47.530] the
[00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:48.090] alternative
[00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.470] plans.
[00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.450] So
[00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.690] what
[00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.850] would
[00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:51.010] be
[00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:51.170] a
[00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:51.390] measure
[00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:51.790] for
[00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:52.290] on
[00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:52.450]-time
[00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:53.070] performance?
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.040] Right,
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:03.280] yeah.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:03.600] So
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:03.860] let's
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:04.080] say
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.100] percentage
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.700] of
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.000] on
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.400]-time
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.000] arrivals.
[00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.750] So
[00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.610] we
[00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:15.030] would
[00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:15.570] say
[00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.050] percentage
[00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:16.310] of
[00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.470] on
[00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.650]-time
[00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:17.030] arrivals,
[00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.210] and
[00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.370] we
[00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:17.550] would
[00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:17.990] define
[00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.690] on
[00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:18.890]-time
[00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:19.350] arrivals
[00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.650] to
[00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:20.170] be
[00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.390] between
[00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.070] 0
[00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.690] and
[00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.050] 5
[00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:23.450] minutes
[00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.970] of
[00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:24.090] a
[00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:24.370] schedule.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:27.820] And
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.140] then
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.400] the
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:29.780] standard
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.160] that
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:30.580] many

[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.320] this
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.920] would
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.260] be

[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.280] basically.
[00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:47.370] So
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.160] this
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:49.440] way,
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.360] the

[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.200] agency
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.600] can
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.280] go
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:52.700] ahead
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.260] and
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.300] evaluate
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:55.600] the

[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:58.840] who

[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.520] are
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:00.780] running
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.040] some

[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:04.380] and
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:04.500] say,
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:04.740] OK,
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.520] your
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.120] performance
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.420] in
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:07.640] terms
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:07.780] of
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:08.280] reliability
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:08.660] has
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:08.780] been

[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.400] not.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:11.800] Shouldn't
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:11.940] the

[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:12.780] also

[00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:17.530] standard?
[00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:18.270] So
[00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:18.450] for
[00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:18.850] example,
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.380] if
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:19.980] the
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.180] goal
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:21.440] was
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:21.900] reliability
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.220] for
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:22.440] the

[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.160] as
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.380] well,
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.040] and
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.180] the
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:25.520] reliability
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:25.900] was
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.480] somewhere
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:26.820] around
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.360] 80%,
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.020] and
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:28.220] now
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.360] the
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:28.580] goal
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:28.780] is
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.020] to
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.580] achieve
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:29.800] a

[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.240] that
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:32.420] with
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:32.580] the

[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.200] one
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:33.500] would
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.040] create
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.200] a
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:34.600] benchmark.
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.000] Yeah,
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:35.240] yeah,
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.540] exactly.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:36.080] So
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.500] another
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.240] measure
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:37.540] would
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.260] be

[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:42.660] baseline.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.480] And
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:43.760] then
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.800] the
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.180] transit
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:45.580] agency
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:45.880] can

[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.340] should

[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:51.560] for
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.860] reliability.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:53.680] Thank
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.160] you.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.000] So
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.260] then
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.180] one
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:56.460] other
[00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.090] interesting

[00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:04.910] actually
[00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:05.250] comes

[00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:05.750] mind
[00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:06.070] looking

[00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:14.130] That
[00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:14.550] basically
[00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:14.910] means
[00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:15.230] that
[00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.770] you
[00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:16.370] consider

[00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.230] Misconnections.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:38.760] Expect
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:38.980] it
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.100] to
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:39.240] be

[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:40.380] but
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.500] left.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.300] Yeah,
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:42.620] yeah.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:43.800] So
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.260] it
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:44.460] can
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:44.620] be

[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.900] typical
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:49.880] assumptions
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.700] about
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.240] passenger
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:51.940] arrivals,
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:53.040] early
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:53.580] arrivals
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.040] of
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.680] buses
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.160] and
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:56.620] service
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:56.920] is
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.600] usually
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.200] more
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.860] negative
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.000] as
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.060] late
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:01.520] arrivals.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.260] Let's
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:02.460] make
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:02.640] an
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.000] example
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.280] here.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:03.680] For
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.020] example,
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.560] let's
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.080] assume
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.340] under
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.360] uniform
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:09.840] arrivals
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.080] of
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.600] passengers,
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:11.700] let's
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:11.980] assume
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.220] if
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:12.400] this
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:12.540] is
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:12.740] my
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.260] scheduled
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.700] arrivals
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:15.540] over
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:15.900] the
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.240] axis
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:16.500] of
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:16.900] time,
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:17.560] and
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:17.760] this
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:17.920] is
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.180] my
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.100] number
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:19.360] of
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.020] passengers
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.040] waiting
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.480] in
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:21.780] the
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.520] bus
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.080] stop.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:24.820] Under
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.060] uniform
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.180] arrivals,
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:30.640] we
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.420] have
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:31.660] some
[00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:34.730] accumulation
[00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:35.050] of
[00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:35.430] passengers
[00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.630] that
[00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.770] are
[00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:36.050] waiting
[00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:36.290] at
[00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:36.450] the
[00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:36.770] stop.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.000] And
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.140] then
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:43.320] what
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:43.660] happens
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:43.900] is
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.200] that
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:44.840] if
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.420] one
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:45.560] of
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:45.780] these
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.280] buses
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:46.600] are
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.000] early,
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:48.640] let's
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:48.880] say
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880] it
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.600] basically
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.080] arrives
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:51.240] at
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.480] this
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.400] time,
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:53.280] what
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:53.600] happens
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:53.800] is
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:53.980] that
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.160] the
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:54.400] amount
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:54.600] of
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:54.940] time
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.600] that
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:55.760] we
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:55.860] are
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.480] saving
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.720] due
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:57.980] to
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.300] this
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:58.800] arrival
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.680] is
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.320] basically
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.520] less
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:01.720] than
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:01.860] the
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.080] amount
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:02.280] of
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:02.660] time
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.640] that
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:03.860] will
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:04.040] be
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:04.300] added
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:04.600] to
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:04.840] our
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.300] waiting
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:05.780] time
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.280] for
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:08.960] the
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.180] next
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:09.500] trip.
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:09.860] And
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.100] that's
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:10.360] because
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:10.620] number
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:10.800] of
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.040] people
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:11.200] who
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:11.300] are
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.020] experiencing
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:12.500] this
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.520] is
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.120] a
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:14.300] little
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:14.840] higher.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.320] Number
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:15.480] of
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:15.700] people
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:15.840] that
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:15.960] are
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.920] experiencing
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:19.620] the
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:20.140] additional
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:20.500] waiting
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:20.880] time
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.260] is
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:21.620] higher
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:21.820] than
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.120] number
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.380] of
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.020] people
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:23.220] who
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:23.360] are
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.280] experiencing
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:24.540] the
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.360] early
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:26.880] arrival
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.600] and
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.760] a
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.060] cut
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:29.300] to
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:29.460] their
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:29.700] waiting
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:29.940] time.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.080] So
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:30.240] if
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:30.360] you
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:30.680] compare
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.000] these
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.020] two
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:35.540] areas,
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:36.000] that
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.420] basically
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:36.760] tells
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.320] you
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.460] you're
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:39.860] basically
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.360] having
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:40.820] a
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.140] loss
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:41.740] or
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:42.180] having
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:42.360] an
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:42.720] increase
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:42.880] in
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.100] waiting
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.520] time
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.040] if
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:44.260] your
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:44.600] service
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.540] is
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:45.880] early.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:46.500] And
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:46.600] then
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:46.740] the
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.120] situation
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:47.580] becomes
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.040] worse
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.320] in
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:49.440] the
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:49.640] case
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:49.800] that
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:49.980] you
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.360] suggested.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:50.640] When
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.140] people
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:51.580] are
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.560] coordinating
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.060] with
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:53.260] the
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:53.660] system,
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:54.580] for
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:54.940] example,
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.400] it
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:55.540] is
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:55.920] assumed
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.220] that,
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.500] and
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.140] it
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:58.380] can
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:58.740] actually
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:58.980] be
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.340] proven
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.400] by
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:00.720] looking
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:00.920] at
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.040] the
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:01.320] data
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:01.660] too,
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:01.980] that
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.680] people
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.340] make
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:03.520] the
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:03.980] transition
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.460] to
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.540] coordinated
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.240] behavior
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:06.560] and
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.040] coordination
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:07.620] with
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.000] the
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:08.360] schedule
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.040] as
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:09.740] the
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:10.600] frequency
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:10.900] of
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.660] service
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.900] increases.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:13.220] For
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:13.560] example,
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:14.320] for
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.040] a
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:16.720] service
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:16.920] that
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.100] is
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:17.520] scheduled
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:17.960] to
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.560] be
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:18.960] delivered
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.320] every
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:19.680] half
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:19.960] hour
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.160] or
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.500] every
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.740] one
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.080] hour,
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.480] it
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:22.960] is
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.380] expected
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:23.740] that
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:24.520] passengers
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:24.840] are
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.300] coordinating
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:25.760] with
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.020] the
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.120] system
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:27.820] and
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.020] coordinating
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:29.440] their
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:29.940] arrivals
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:30.200] with
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:30.440] the
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.160] departure
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:31.440] of
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.360] the
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.120] buses.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:34.760] But
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.140] when
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.300] it
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:35.560] comes
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.380] to
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.500] more
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.040] frequent
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.120] service,
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:39.760] then
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.220] we
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:40.400] will
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:40.620] have
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.220] more
[00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.650] uniform
[00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:45.230] arrivals.
[00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.630] So
[00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:45.730] in
[00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:45.910] that
[00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:46.170] case,
[00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.390] what
[00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:46.570] we
[00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:46.730] would
[00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:47.070] observe
[00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.230] is
[00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.450] that
[00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.850] passengers'
[00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.330] arrivals
[00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:48.550] would
[00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.010] resemble
[00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.390] something
[00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:49.670] like
[00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.010] this.
[00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:55.550] Well,
[00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:56.170] it
[00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:56.430] has
[00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.610] to
[00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:56.830] go
[00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:57.030] up
[00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:57.270] to
[00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.550] here,
[00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:58.910] the
[00:32:58.910 --> 00:32:59.310] original
[00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.810] case.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:01.500] And
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:01.840] then
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.880] in
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.100] that
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:04.380] case,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.080] if
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.300] your
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:05.640] service
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:05.860] is
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:06.220] early
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.020] by
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:07.660] 5
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:07.760] or
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:07.980] 10
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.360] minutes,
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:08.860] you
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.020] would
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:09.380] have
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:09.860] the
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.880] main
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.220] bulk
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:11.420] of
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.020] your
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:12.980] passengers
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:13.240] who
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:13.420] need
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:13.560] to
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:13.780] wait
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:14.740] another
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.340] headway,
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:16.820] basically.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:17.740] So
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.360] this
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:18.760] should
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:18.940] be
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.280] actually
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:19.580] added
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:19.840] to
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.460] your
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.400] computation
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:21.720] too.
[00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:24.490] Is
[00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:24.610] there
[00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:24.730] any
[00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:25.070] questions
[00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.330] about
[00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:25.530] this?
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:29.760] OK.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:34.860] So
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.580] in
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:35.840] terms
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.140] of
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.220] the
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:38.920] advantage
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.180] of
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:39.660] guidelines
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.080] in
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.220] transit
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:41.760] planning,
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.300] one
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:43.460] of
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:43.620] the
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:43.920] main
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.320] purposes
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:44.800] of
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.740] these
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.080] guidelines
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:46.380] is
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:46.640] to
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.100] communicate
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:47.420] to
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:47.900] public
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.360] the
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:48.720] rationale
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.060] and
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:49.200] the
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:49.560] logic
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.100] behind
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.340] your
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:50.740] decision
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.100] making
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:51.660] and
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.000] behind
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.220] your
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:52.700] allocation
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:52.980] of
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.440] resources
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.100] to
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:54.320] the
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:54.700] system.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.100] It
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:55.340] also
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:55.680] gives
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.020] you
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:56.960] a
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.420] consistent
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:57.720] and
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:57.960] fair
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.380] basis
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:58.680] for
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.360] decision
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:33:59.800] making.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:00.640] And
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.920] it
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.900] somehow
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.720] gives
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.120] you
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:04.620] a
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:04.980] tool
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:05.280] to
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:05.980] justify
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.300] your
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:06.840] decisions
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.400] and
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:07.640] also
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:07.820] a
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.000] tool
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.200] to
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:08.420] make
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:08.680] sure
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.000] that
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.600] your
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.000] decisions
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.340] are
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:10.640] fair
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:11.000] and
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.920] justified
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.600] in
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:12.900] nature.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:13.960] It
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.240] also
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:14.660] gives
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.000] you
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.400] the
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:16.820] opportunity
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:17.120] to
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:17.540] balance
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.480] the
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:18.920] improvement
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.280] and
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:19.440] the
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:19.960] investments
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.360] to
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.560] the
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:21.960] network
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.240] and
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:22.520] gain
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.460] a
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:23.780] uniform
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:24.120] level
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:24.280] of
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:24.580] service
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.080] improvement
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:26.240] for
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:26.800] efficient
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.340] service.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.380] So
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.140] the
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:31.880] guidelines
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.120] that
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:32.220] are
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:32.760] existing
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.040] in
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:33.140] the
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:33.520] literature
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.180] and
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:34.480] in
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:34.600] the
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.160] practice,
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:35.720] basically,
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:35.900] in
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.020] the
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:36.220] state
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:36.380] of
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:36.820] practice,
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:37.740] are
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.140] dealing
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:38.580] with
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.180] the
[00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.590] service,
[00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.850] with
[00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:41.970] the
[00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:42.350] design
[00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:42.530] of
[00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.850] service,
[00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:43.070] and
[00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.250] with
[00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.410] the

[00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:44.430] service.
[00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:45.070] So
[00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.370] the
[00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:46.710] design
[00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.890] of
[00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:47.210] service,
[00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:47.750] basically,
[00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:49.270] dealing
[00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.810] with
[00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.530] variables
[00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.810] that
[00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:51.950] are
[00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:52.330] related
[00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:53.250] to

[00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:56.950] spacing
[00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:57.230] and
[00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.570] density
[00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:57.790] of
[00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:58.210] trips,
[00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.550] and
[00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.010] frequency
[00:34:59.010 --> 00:34:59.270] of
[00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.390] the

[00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.050] as
[00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:01.190] it
[00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.370] is
[00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.830] designed
[00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:02.030] and
[00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.230] as

[00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:03.110] schedule.
[00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:03.930] So
[00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:04.130] there
[00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.250] are
[00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:04.590] guidelines

[00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:05.590] And
[00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:05.790] there's
[00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:06.030] also
[00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.490] guidelines
[00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.030] related
[00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.410] to

[00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:08.290] you
[00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:08.830] deliver
[00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:09.270] or
[00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.450] how
[00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:09.630] the

[00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.610] took
[00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:16.010] place.
[00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.910] So
[00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:19.630] the
[00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.850] main
[00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:20.290] factors

[00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.610] And
[00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:39.170] it
[00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.730] basically
[00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.070] includes

[00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:48.430] that
[00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.690] are,
[00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:49.570] or
[00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:49.970] factors
[00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:50.210] that
[00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.390] are
[00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.990] defining
[00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.210] the

[00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:53.650] reliability,
[00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.250] and
[00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:54.710] access.
[00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:55.190] This
[00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.310] is
[00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.610] access
[00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:55.890] over
[00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:56.270] time
[00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.430] and
[00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.670] also

[00:35:59.070 --> 00:35:59.750] So
[00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:00.430] why
[00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.830] do
[00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:00.970] we,
[00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.230] again,
[00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:01.510] have

[00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:05.090] So
[00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:05.430] if
[00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:06.110] frequency
[00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:06.350] and

[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.580] So
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:32.180] let
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:32.360] me
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.400] go

[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.500] It
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.060] basically,
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.100] as

[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:08.760] However,
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:09.540] in
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:09.780] those
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.160] cases,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:10.480] there
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:10.600] is
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:10.720] a
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.040] burden
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.420] of
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:11.900] coordination
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.400] that
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:12.540] is
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:12.960] imposed
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.460] to
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:13.900] the
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:14.360] passenger.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:14.960] So
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.160] if
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:15.280] you
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:15.500] have
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:15.660] to
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.060] coordinate
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:16.800] your
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.320] arrival,
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.040] for
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:18.360] example,
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:18.640] for
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:18.880] your,
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:19.340] in
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:19.480] the
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:19.700] morning
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.020] from
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:20.340] home
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:20.500] to
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:20.900] work,
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:21.440] then
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:21.740] there
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.800] is
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:22.980] some
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:23.260] sort
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:23.360] of
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.100] inconvenience
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:24.300] that
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:24.420] is
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:24.760] imposed
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.180] to
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:25.420] you
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.040] to
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:26.620] basically,
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.500] to
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:28.960] make
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.760] it
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:29.920] to
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.260] your
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.560] coordinated
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.080] schedule.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:33.140] And
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:33.340] then
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:33.740] waiting
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.040] time
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:34.200] is
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:34.400] also
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:34.820] important
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.320] because
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.840] if
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.160] the
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:39.780] service
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.060] is
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.600] frequent,
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:41.540] but
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.720] at
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.080] different
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:44.480] ranges
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:44.720] of
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.240] frequency,
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:45.740] you
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:45.880] may
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.420] experience
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:46.780] different
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.040] waiting
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:47.440] time
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.080] if
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.380] the
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:49.980] process
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.300] of
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.060] arrivals
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:51.260] of
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:51.720] passenger
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.220] is
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:52.520] assumed
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:52.700] to
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.200] be
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:53.600] a
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:53.800] random
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.220] process.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.220] Then
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:55.820] reliability,
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:56.260] as
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:56.380] we
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:56.760] discussed,
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.060] is
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:57.520] one
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:57.660] of
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:57.760] the
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.240] important
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.300] features
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:00.660] and
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:00.920] one
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.020] of
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:01.140] the
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:01.420] important
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:01.800] aspects
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.040] of
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.180] the
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:02.580] service.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.680] It
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.060] usually
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:05.500] is
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:05.940] a
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:06.160] measure
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:06.640] based
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.060] on
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:07.500] on
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:07.660]-time
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.100] arrivals
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:08.360] of
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:08.480] the
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:08.820] service.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:09.800] And
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.200] then
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:13.260] the
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:13.640] next
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.580] aspect
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:15.760] that
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:15.860] is
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:16.220] important
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:16.480] is
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.020] access
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:17.760] to
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.620] origins
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:18.900] and
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.400] destinations.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:21.100] This
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:21.440] access
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:21.680] can
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:21.840] be
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.200] interpreted
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:22.500] in
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:22.680] two
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.020] ways.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:23.060] One
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:23.060] is
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.500] we
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:24.680] can
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:24.860] look
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.000] at
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:25.320] access
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:25.620] in
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.000] terms
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.120] of
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:26.480] space
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:26.660] and
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:26.800] in
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.000] terms
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.140] of
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:27.440] time.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.060] Access
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:28.240] in
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:28.440] terms
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:28.560] of
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:28.920] space
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.220] is
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.600] closeness
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.060] to
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:31.620] the
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:31.820] bus
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.200] stops
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:32.400] and
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.040] closeness
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:33.340] to
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:33.860] the

[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.160] from
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.360] origin
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:36.620] and
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:36.800] from
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:36.960] the
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.440] destination.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.280] Access
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:38.500] in
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:38.700] terms
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:38.860] of
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.100] time
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:39.300] would
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:39.420] be
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:39.540] the
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:39.760] span
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:39.920] of
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.460] service
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:40.980] when
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.160] you
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:41.400] like
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:41.560] to
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:41.940] travel.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:43.540] And
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:43.980] basically,
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:44.260] what
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:44.420] is
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:44.580] the
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:44.860] service
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.180] time
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:45.320] and
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.640] available
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.700] times
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:47.860] of
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.260] service.
[00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.470] So,
[00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:51.910] yeah,
[00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:52.090] as
[00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:52.230] I
[00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.530] mentioned,
[00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:52.830] most
[00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:53.230] agencies
[00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.570] have
[00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.090] guidelines
[00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:54.590] covering
[00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:54.810] the

[00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.170] of
[00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:55.650] service.
[00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:56.130] For
[00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:56.490] example,
[00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:58.690] MBTA
[00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.650] has

[00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.110] guideline
[00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:01.470] that
[00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:02.470] for
[00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:03.210] weekdays,
[00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.390] you
[00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.010] need
[00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:05.170] to
[00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:05.410] have

[00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.930] has
[00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:27.270] a

[00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:30.430] related
[00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:31.010] to
[00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.070] basically
[00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:32.990] a

[00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:37.030] and
[00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.350] goals.
[00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:38.690] Let
[00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.810] me
[00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:39.090] read
[00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:39.450] from
[00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:42.130] these.
[00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:43.370] At
[00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:43.530] least
[00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:43.850] 90

[00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.870] and
[00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:46.330] employees
[00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:46.510] in

[00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:47.870] areas
[00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:48.090] should
[00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:48.290] have

[00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.630] So,
[00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.890] this
[00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:53.150] is

[00:41:58.610 --> 00:41:58.830] When
[00:41:58.830 --> 00:41:59.110] they
[00:41:59.110 --> 00:41:59.250] say
[00:41:59.250 --> 00:41:59.530] 90
[00:41:59.530 --> 00:41:59.710]%

[00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.530] and
[00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.910] employees,
[00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:01.670] basically
[00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.190] they're
[00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.490] looking
[00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:03.330] at
[00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:03.450] the

[00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:04.310] twice.
[00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.750] I
[00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:04.870] mean,
[00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:05.130] the
[00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:05.390] person
[00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.750] is
[00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:06.010] on
[00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:06.490] one
[00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:06.650] end

[00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:08.570] employee.
[00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:09.170] Right,
[00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:09.610] yes.
[00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:10.390] So,
[00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:10.810] it's...
[00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.770] Yeah,
[00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:12.010] you
[00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:12.350] want
[00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:12.510] to
[00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.930] consider
[00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.570] both
[00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:13.910] ends
[00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:14.170] of
[00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.370] the
[00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:15.670] trip,
[00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.950] right?
[00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:16.510] And
[00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.850] these
[00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:17.830] percentages
[00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:18.290] are
[00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:18.430] a
[00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.610] little
[00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:19.030] tricky.
[00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.530] Sometimes
[00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:20.070] they're
[00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:20.410] counting
[00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:20.590] the
[00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:20.830] number
[00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:20.990] of
[00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.230] people,
[00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:21.510] number
[00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.670] of
[00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:22.070] residents.
[00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.510] Sometimes
[00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.870] they're
[00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:23.550] counting
[00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:24.230] OD
[00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.790] pairs.
[00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.470] Sometimes
[00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.790] they're
[00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:26.070] counting
[00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:26.710] passengers.
[00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:27.450] So,
[00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.330] it's
[00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:29.450] a

[00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.590] these
[00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:32.610] correctly.
[00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:33.230] So,
[00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.550] the
[00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:33.810] second
[00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:34.070] one
[00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:34.470] basically
[00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.870] says

[00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.710] from
[00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:39.130] downtown
[00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:39.590] Vancouver
[00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:39.930] should
[00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.330] require
[00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:40.550] no

[00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:42.590] transfer.
[00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:43.710] That
[00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:44.250] basically
[00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:44.670] is
[00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:45.110] 98
[00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:45.690]%
[00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:45.990] of
[00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.310] people
[00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.490] who
[00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.630] are
[00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:47.110] traveling
[00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:48.330] from
[00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:49.070] and
[00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:49.270] to

[00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:51.710] And
[00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.110] so,
[00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:53.590] it
[00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:54.050] may
[00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.150] be

[00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.790] out
[00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:12.190] and
[00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:13.370] basically
[00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:14.090] and
[00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:14.330] ask

[00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:18.890] It's
[00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:19.090] called

[00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.930] You
[00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:24.010] have

[00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.570] OK.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:28.500] So,

[00:43:59.740 --> 00:43:59.880] And

[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:04.920] It

[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.380] requires

[00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:19.450] OK.
[00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:19.810] So,

[00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.590] Yeah.
[00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:22.130] In

[00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.410] I

[00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:37.170] people.
[00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:37.410] So,
[00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:37.570] you
[00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:37.870] actually
[00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:38.050] have
[00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:38.810] a
[00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:39.130] few
[00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:40.710] municipal
[00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.470] entities
[00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:41.970] for

[00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:43.010] area.
[00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:43.610] But
[00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:43.750] you
[00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.850] could
[00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:43.990] have
[00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.330] areas
[00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:44.850] where
[00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:45.490] that
[00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:45.890] condition
[00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:46.130] would
[00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:46.470] be
[00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:47.150] a
[00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.290] little

[00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:48.050] strict
[00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.270] if
[00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.410] you
[00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.550] have,
[00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.750] let's
[00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.850] say,
[00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:49.250] Boston
[00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.610] area
[00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:49.850] which
[00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:50.050] is
[00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:50.930] generally
[00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:51.250] slightly
[00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:51.650] smaller
[00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:52.070] suburbs
[00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:52.270] and
[00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.630] then
[00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.930] more
[00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:53.270] suburbs
[00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.450] to
[00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:53.830] connect.
[00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.430] Right.
[00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.790] Yeah.
[00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.350] So,
[00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:55.910] some
[00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:56.110] of
[00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:56.290] these
[00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:56.530] may
[00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:56.870] actually
[00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:57.470] be
[00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.670] a
[00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.850] little
[00:44:57.850 --> 00:44:58.190] tricky
[00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.470] to
[00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.030] measure
[00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.950] and
[00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:00.430] to
[00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:00.950] quantify.
[00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.510] Yeah,
[00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.630] and
[00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:01.750] to
[00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:02.310] compare.
[00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:02.790] Right.
[00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:04.310] Yeah.
[00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:05.290] When
[00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:05.430] I
[00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.610] see
[00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:05.770] these
[00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:06.030] numbers
[00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.230] and
[00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.430] I
[00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:07.050] try
[00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:07.190] to
[00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.350] think
[00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:07.610] about
[00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:08.130] equity,
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:12.660] people
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:12.740] benefit
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:13.040] from
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:13.380] that.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:13.820] Yeah.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:14.520] Right.
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:14.740] About
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:15.100] 5
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:15.460]%
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:15.640] of
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:15.780] it.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.240] So,
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:17.600] how
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:17.720] do
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:17.780] you
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:18.040] navigate
[00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.450] this
[00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:18.530] stuff
[00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.910] in
[00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:19.450] Vancouver?
[00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:22.330] Right.
[00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.930] This
[00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:23.130] is
[00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:23.250] a
[00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:23.430] good,
[00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:24.030] really
[00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.250] good
[00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:24.570] point.
[00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:25.090] Some
[00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:25.270] of
[00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.490] these
[00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:26.130] percentages,
[00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:26.450] I
[00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.710] think,
[00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:27.370] are
[00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:27.810] related
[00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.510] to
[00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.010] random
[00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:30.610] variables.
[00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:31.410] And
[00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:31.770] those
[00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.110] are
[00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:32.570] somehow
[00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.170] acceptable
[00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.690] because
[00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:34.330] that's
[00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:34.510] when
[00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:34.690] you
[00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:34.930] try
[00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:35.110] to
[00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:35.570] define
[00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:36.130] a
[00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:36.530] confidence
[00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:37.110] interval.
[00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.730] But
[00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.890] when
[00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:38.030] it
[00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.310] comes
[00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:38.570] to
[00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:38.870] cases
[00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:39.210] like
[00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:39.730] this,
[00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.890] it
[00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:41.470] is
[00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.870] not
[00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:42.030] a
[00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.290] random
[00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:42.790] variable
[00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:43.190] anymore.
[00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:43.790] It's
[00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:44.310] basically
[00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.010] like
[00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:45.250] a
[00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:45.630] special
[00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:46.190] variable
[00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.650] that
[00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:46.870] is
[00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:48.610] constantly
[00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.310] requires
[00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:51.810] like
[00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:51.950] a
[00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:52.150] certain
[00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.490] amount
[00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:52.670] of
[00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:53.070] connections
[00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:53.430] to

[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:55.600] area.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:55.880] Right.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:56.600] So,
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:56.840] that
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.120] may
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:57.240] be
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:57.420] one
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:57.540] of

[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:58.540] of
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:45:59.360] this
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:45:59.880] guideline.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.020] That's
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:01.120] a
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:01.260] really
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:01.460] good

[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:02.160] And
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.840] because
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:04.460] one
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:04.700] may
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.180] argue
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:05.520] that
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:05.760] if

[00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:38.950] these
[00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:39.210] are

[00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.370] a

[00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:53.690] So,
[00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:54.450] I
[00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:54.650] think

[00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:54.990] they
[00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.210] try
[00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:55.410] to
[00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:55.630] do
[00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.870] is

[00:46:58.410 --> 00:46:58.570] that

[00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:00.070] being
[00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:00.570] implemented
[00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:01.830] would
[00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:02.690] satisfy
[00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:03.050] this.
[00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:03.510] But
[00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.690] I'm
[00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:03.990] not

[00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.850] conditions
[00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:08.070] or
[00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:08.330] not.
[00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:10.090] Sorry.

[00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:12.330] that
[00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:12.570] does

[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.200] for
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:42.700] route
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.040] design.
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:43.520] So,
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.060] what
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:44.240] it
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:44.500] says
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:44.700] is
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:44.900] that
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.500] deviations
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:45.780] from
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:45.960] the
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.200] most
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:46.640] direct
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.060] route
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:47.380] must
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:47.640] have
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.040] walking
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:48.440] time
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:48.920] savings
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.640] for
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.280] customers
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:50.920] on
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.060] the
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:51.320] added
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:51.640] route
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.040] section
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:52.420] greater
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:52.840] than
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:53.240] the
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:53.740] increase
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.100] in
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:54.360] total
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:54.720] travel
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.120] time
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:55.820] for
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:56.000] two
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.560] passengers.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:57.340] So,
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.180] does
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:00.580] anyone
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.160] have
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:01.600] any
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.680] interpretation,
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:04.040] quick
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:04.520] interpretation
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.100] on
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:05.380] this
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.060] guideline?
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.000] The
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:09.100] only
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:09.400] reason
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:09.540] I
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:09.620] do
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:09.740] it
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:09.880] is
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:09.960] if
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.080] there's
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:10.180] a
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:10.640] major
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.640] destination
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:11.920] where
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.120] people
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:12.280] are
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:12.420] on
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:12.480] the
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:12.600] route.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:21.640] The
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:21.860] second
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:21.960] to
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:22.120] last
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:22.400] stop
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:22.520] on
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:22.620] the
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:22.800] route,
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.080] maybe
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:23.240] you
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:23.420] make
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:23.620] that
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.120] deviation.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:27.480] Right.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:27.820] Yeah.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:28.960] Right.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:29.420] You
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:29.740] had
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:29.840] a
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.060] comment
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:30.280] too?
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:32.640] Right.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:32.960] Yeah.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:33.600] So,
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:33.800] if
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:33.940] you
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.140] look
[00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:34.300] at
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.040] the
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.700] problem
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:37.000] or
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:37.220] look
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:37.360] at
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:37.500] the
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.120] situation
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.280] from
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:39.480] the
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:39.860] perspective
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:40.140] of
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:40.520] system
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:40.760] and
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:40.940] from
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:41.100] the
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:41.480] perspective
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:41.760] of
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.060] total
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:42.420] travel
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:42.720] time
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:42.840] in
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:42.980] the
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:43.400] system,
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:44.080] what
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:44.380] they
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.180] basically
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.020] are
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:46.660] requiring
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.080] is
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:47.440] that,
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.120] for
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:48.460] example,
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:48.920] let's
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:49.320] assume
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:49.500] that
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:49.640] I
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:49.840] have
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:49.980] a
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:50.320] suburb
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:50.780] here
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:51.360] and
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:51.520] then
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:51.740] this
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:51.860] is
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:52.100] my
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:52.460] downtown
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:52.980] area
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:53.420] and
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:53.720] there's
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:53.940] a
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:54.240] route
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:54.700] here
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.160] that
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:55.380] has
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:55.820] multiple
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:56.460] stops
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:56.960] and
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.120] then
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:57.640] there's
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:57.960] another
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.420] suburb
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:58.860] here
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:48:59.960] which
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.540] in
[00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:00.740] the
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.100] original

[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:03.260] route.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:03.660] However,
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:03.880] it
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.340] requires
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:04.540] a
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:04.780] walking
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:05.200] link
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.200] to
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:07.920] different
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.480] stops.
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:09.200] What
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:09.540] this
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.200] guideline
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:10.740] basically
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:11.380] requires
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:11.660] is
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.000] that

[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:24.600] then
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.260] you
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:25.560] cannot

[00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:33.770] And
[00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:34.790] that's
[00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:35.210] basically
[00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:35.450] the
[00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:35.810] case
[00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:36.490] when

[00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:47.110] would
[00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:47.330] go

[00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:54.890] And

[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:21.500] For

[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:22.300] there
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:22.500] should

[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.100] So
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:28.700] let's
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:29.060] discuss
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:29.240] a
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:29.360] little
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:29.660] bit

[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.200] about

[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:31.920] Why
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.080] do
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:32.180] you
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:32.340] think
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:32.500] that
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:32.640] we
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:32.780] need
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:32.900] to
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.160] have
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:33.540] a

[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:35.680] maximum
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.260] policy
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:36.960] headway?
[00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:40.030] If
[00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:40.630] we
[00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:41.630] are
[00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:42.090] considering
[00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:42.390] the
[00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.750] demand
[00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:43.310] and
[00:51:43.310 --> 00:51:43.590] if
[00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:43.690] we
[00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:43.790] are
[00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:44.030] trying
[00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.230] to
[00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.690] satisfy
[00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.950] the

[00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:47.130] of
[00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:47.810] vehicles
[00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:48.050] that
[00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:48.170] we
[00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.270] are
[00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.670] assigning
[00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:49.130] to
[00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:50.310] the
[00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:51.830] route,
[00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.310] then
[00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:52.550] why
[00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:52.750] should
[00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.910] we
[00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:53.110] care
[00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:53.470] about
[00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:53.850] a
[00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:54.130] minimum?
[00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:55.030] Did
[00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.170] you?
[00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:02.410] Yeah.
[00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:03.790] Yeah.
[00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:04.250] Exactly,
[00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.810] yeah.
[00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.490] Again,
[00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:06.030] the
[00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.910] equity
[00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:07.270] issue
[00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.430] and
[00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.570] the

[00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:08.550] issue
[00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:09.030] basically.
[00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.730] Right.
[00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:09.870] And
[00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.970] there's
[00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:10.230] still,
[00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:10.450] and
[00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:10.610] there
[00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:10.690] are
[00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:10.950] also,
[00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.130] you
[00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:11.310] know,
[00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:11.770] still
[00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:12.710] elderly
[00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:13.050] people
[00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:13.230] who
[00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.470] don't
[00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.790] use

[00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.750] to

[00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:18.410] Right.
[00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:18.890] And
[00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:19.310] you
[00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:19.470] don't

[00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.830] Right,
[00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:22.350] exactly.
[00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:23.290] Right.
[00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:25.890] Okay.
[00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:26.350] And
[00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:26.530] then
[00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:26.830] when

[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:03.770] Yeah.
[00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:04.050] So

[00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:11.630] It

[00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:27.050] So

[00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:56.630] Why
[00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.770] do
[00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:56.910] we

[00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:00.630] The
[00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.850] first
[00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:01.150] reason
[00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:01.350] is
[00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:01.650] that
[00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:02.110] we
[00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:02.250] do
[00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:02.510] not

[00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:26.150] increase

[00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:28.970] For
[00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:29.310] example,
[00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.630] in
[00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.770] the
[00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:30.270] acceptable,
[00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:31.510] in
[00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.790] the
[00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:32.930] regular

[00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:40.010] are
[00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.470] considered.
[00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:41.150] However,
[00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.410] the

[00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:42.110] that
[00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:42.430] we
[00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:43.670] estimate
[00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:44.090] based
[00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:44.230] on

[00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:45.550] should

[00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:48.430] So
[00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.750] that's
[00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:48.890] the

[00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.470] However,
[00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.710] it's
[00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.810] a

[00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.930] So,

[00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.370] in
[00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:49.830] AM
[00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:50.090] and
[00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:50.370] PM
[00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:50.850] peak,
[00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:51.690] you
[00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:51.850] would
[00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:52.230] allow
[00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.430] an
[00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.750] average
[00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:53.230] of
[00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:54.270] 60
[00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:55.230] passengers
[00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:56.290] on
[00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:56.590] board.
[00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:57.930] However,
[00:56:57.930 --> 00:56:58.230] when
[00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.370] it
[00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.630] comes
[00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.850] to
[00:56:58.850 --> 00:56:59.530] computations
[00:56:59.530 --> 00:56:59.830] of
[00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:00.730] peak
[00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:01.090] 30
[00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:01.490] minutes,
[00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:02.070] you
[00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:02.250] would
[00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:02.510] only
[00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.850] allow
[00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:03.390] 55.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:12.680] Yeah,
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:12.860] yeah.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:13.940] Right.
[00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:15.530] Yeah,
[00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.930] that
[00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:16.390] could
[00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.550] be
[00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:16.770] one
[00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:17.050] reason.
[00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:17.970] That's
[00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:18.390] actually
[00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.910] yielded
[00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:19.150] to
[00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.550] this
[00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:20.070] design.
[00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:20.490] Any
[00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:20.710] other
[00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:21.090] thoughts
[00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:21.330] or
[00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:22.290] suggestions?
[00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.510] Yeah,
[00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.510] so
[00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.990] 15
[00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.230] minutes,
[00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:26.450] you
[00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:26.570] can
[00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:26.790] go
[00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:26.910] to
[00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:27.670] that.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:34.940] Yeah.
[00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:36.510] Yeah,
[00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:37.110] exactly.
[00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:38.330] Yeah,
[00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.610] please.
[00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:39.010] Is
[00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:39.190] this
[00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.430] like
[00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.730] a,
[00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.630] could
[00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.770] be
[00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:40.930] like
[00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:41.030] a
[00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.190] chicken
[00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.370] or
[00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:41.570] egg
[00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:42.510] problem
[00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.950] where
[00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:45.110] the
[00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:45.350] routes
[00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:45.570] where
[00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:45.830] you
[00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:45.950] need
[00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:46.090] a
[00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:46.270] peak
[00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:46.690] 15
[00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:46.910] minute
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:47.900] are
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:48.420] ones
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:48.640] that
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:48.820] you
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.000] will
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:49.400] expect
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:49.680] a
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:49.780] lot
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:49.900] of
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:50.160] people
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:50.780] or
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:50.940] is
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:51.060] it
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:51.180] the
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:51.340] other
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:51.520] way
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:51.840] around
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:52.080] where
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:52.360] you
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:52.580] see
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:52.700] a
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:52.800] lot
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:52.900] of
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:53.080] people
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:53.280] and
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:53.480] then
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:53.680] you
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:53.920] make
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:54.860] more
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:54.860] people?
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:55.340] Right.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:56.640] Yes,
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:56.960] right.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.300] Well,
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:57.480] yeah,
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:57.860] that's
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:58.200] exactly
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:58.460] one
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:57:58.600] of
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:57:59.040] the
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:57:59.760] considerations
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.460] in
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.840] design
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:02.260] of
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:02.480] a
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:02.900] frequency
[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:03.400] and
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:03.860] design
[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:04.040] of
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:04.140] a
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:04.500] schedule.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:05.320] So,
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.320] I,
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:08.440] if
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:08.900] I
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:09.140] want
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:09.340] to
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:09.840] reward
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:10.680] what
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.260] Ari
[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:11.660] mentioned,
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:12.140] if
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:12.420] you're
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:12.840] computing
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:13.100] your
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:13.540] average
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:13.840] over
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:14.360] 15
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:14.780] minutes
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:15.400] and
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:15.640] you're
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.080] observing,
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:16.560] and
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:16.800] then
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.280] you're
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:17.640] computing
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:17.920] your
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:18.200] average
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:18.420] over
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:18.900] 13
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:19.300] minutes
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:19.740] and
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:19.940] you're
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:20.280] observing
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:20.560] a
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:20.820] higher
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:21.260] crowding
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:21.600] level
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:21.900] over
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:22.520] the
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.900] accepted
[00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:27.320] level,
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:27.860] then
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:28.500] the
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.000] situation
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.220] becomes
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:30.580] more
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:31.260] critical
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:32.800] if
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.880] you're
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.260] computing
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:34.980] over
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:35.440] 30
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:35.880] minutes
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:36.700] is
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:36.900] more
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:37.280] critical
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:37.620] than
[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:37.780] if
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:37.940] you're
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:38.280] computing
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:38.700] over
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.400] 15
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:40.700] minutes.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:41.020] So,
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:41.200] if
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:41.320] you
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:41.680] observe
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:41.860] an
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:42.300] average
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.120] of

[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:46.360] level
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.220] for
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:47.540] 30
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:47.900] minutes
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:48.120] or
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:48.300] for
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:48.580] longer
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.060] period,
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:49.660] that
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:50.640] is
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:50.840] a
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:51.140] sign
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:51.460] of
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:51.740] a

[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:56.880] level.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:57.920] If,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:58.120] yeah.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.200] Yeah,
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:58:59.380] maybe
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:58:59.560] you
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:58:59.960] explained
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:00.160] it
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:00.620] better.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:00.940] I
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:01.160] shouldn't
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:01.300] have
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:01.660] rewarded
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:01.940] you,
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:02.280] right?
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:04.800] So,
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:05.000] the
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:05.300] other

[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:08.300] covers
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:08.740] is
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:09.980] basically
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:10.600] the

[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:11.980] situation.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:12.560] This
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:12.720] is
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:12.880] one
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.000] of
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:13.100] the
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:13.500] interesting
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:14.000] ones
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:14.480] and
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:14.640] I
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:14.800] do
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:14.980] not
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:15.180] really
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:15.400] know
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:15.700] how
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:16.000] it's
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:16.340] possible
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:16.620] to
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:16.880] measure
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:17.180] this
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:17.360] for
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:17.480] a
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:17.880] design.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:18.420] It's
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:18.860] probably
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.980] usually
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:21.600] being
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:21.960] used
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.240] in
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.000] evaluation
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:23.340] of
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:23.480] the
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:23.840] existing
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.460] service.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.060] It
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:25.480] basically
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.000] deals
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:26.820] with
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.200] a
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.280] number
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:29.520] of
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:29.860] minutes
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:30.260] that
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:30.700] you
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:31.260] expect
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:31.980] from
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.160] passengers
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.640] to
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.280] be
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.660] standing,
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:38.780] maximum
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.120] number
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:39.280] of
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:39.560] minutes
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:40.200] of
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:40.800] being
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.320] standing
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:41.700] on
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:41.940] board.
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:42.460] And
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:42.620] there
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:42.760] is
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.520] a
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:43.760] level
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.080] of
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.240] compliance
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:45.660] that
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:45.780] is
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:46.100] defined
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:46.320] for
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:46.480] each
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:46.780] one.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:47.260] For
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:47.640] example,
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:47.880] you
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.040] would
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:48.520] allow
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.360] no
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:49.580] more
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:49.940] than
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.640] 95
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.360]%
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:53.740] cases
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:54.020] that
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:54.460] passengers
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:54.780] would
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:55.060] have
[00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:55.580] to
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:56.640] stand
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:57.680] more
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:57.900] than
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.200] 20
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:58.600] minutes
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.480] on
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.420] the
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:00.680] trip.
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:02.240] So,
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:02.940] I
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.100] can
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:03.440] imagine
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:03.940] if
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:04.120] you
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:04.360] have
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:04.500] an
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:04.840] existing
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:05.360] system
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:05.660] and
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:06.020] if
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:06.140] you
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:06.380] want
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:06.960] to
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.300] measure
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:08.720] this,
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:09.160] you
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:09.340] can
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:09.540] go
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:09.780] out
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:10.980] and
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.120] survey
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:12.740] these
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.140] numbers
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:13.420] and
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:14.160] compute
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.580] averages
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.040] and
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:16.480] compute
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:16.700] the
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.240] distributions.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.320] However,
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:18.700] if
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:18.840] you
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.040] have
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:19.340] a
[01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:20.800] design
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.800] which
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.080] is
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:22.620] not
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:22.820] in
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:23.240] place,
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:24.660] does
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:24.900] anyone
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.180] have
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:25.400] any
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:25.660] thoughts
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:25.900] how
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:26.080] you
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:26.240] can
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:26.500] come
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:26.680] up
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:26.820] with
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.060] some
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:27.360] sort
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.120] of
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.240] estimation
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.620] for
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:30.800] this
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:31.080] case?
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.060] Yeah.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.280] Simulation
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:37.580] could
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:37.740] be
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:37.920] one
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.280] possible
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:38.540] way
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:38.640] of
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:38.820] doing
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:39.140] this.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:39.560] Yeah.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.560] Simulation
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:40.980] of
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.840] demand
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.440] could
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:43.660] be
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:44.060] one
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.160] possible
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:45.400] way
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:45.560] of
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:45.740] doing
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:46.060] this.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:47.320] Check
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:50.580] like
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.200] this
[01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:52.410] train,
[01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:52.950] I
[01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:53.110] saw
[01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:53.250] the
[01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:53.670] SkyTrain
[01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.990] there.
[01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:55.110] You
[01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:55.390] can
[01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:56.910] see
[01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:57.110] where
[01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:57.250] the
[01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:57.450] train
[01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:57.770] fills
[01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:58.010] up
[01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.130] and
[01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.270] then
[01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.830] assume
[01:00:59.250 --> 01:00:59.530] that
[01:00:59.530 --> 01:00:59.870] everyone
[01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:00.210] else,
[01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.730] everyone
[01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:00.910] that
[01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:01.130] boards
[01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.350] the
[01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:01.570] train
[01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:02.070] afterwards,
[01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:02.790] if
[01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:03.210] you
[01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:03.430] know
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.610] how
[01:01:03.610 --> 01:01:03.770] many
[01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:04.050] people
[01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:04.210] are
[01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:04.510] boarding
[01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:04.730] in
[01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:05.210] QFLA.
[01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:05.870] Right,
[01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:06.150] yeah.
[01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:06.850] To
[01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:07.070] do
[01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:07.370] that,
[01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:07.590] then
[01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:07.730] you
[01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:08.550] can
[01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:08.810] assume
[01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:08.970] that
[01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:09.230] everyone
[01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.630] boarding
[01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.970] after
[01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:10.170] is
[01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:10.510] standing.
[01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.150] And
[01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.290] then
[01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:11.430] you
[01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.590] can
[01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:11.870] see
[01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:12.170] how
[01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.370] many
[01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:12.510] of
[01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:12.750] them
[01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:13.250] have
[01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.570] 20
[01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:13.950] minutes
[01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:14.230] or
[01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.750] more
[01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:15.530] left
[01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.750] on
[01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:16.170] the
[01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:16.510] journey
[01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.830] till
[01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:17.470] the
[01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:17.690] train
[01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:17.850] gets
[01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:17.850] there.
[01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:17.850] Right,
[01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:18.230] exactly.
[01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:18.990] That's
[01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.110] a
[01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:19.230] good
[01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:19.490] idea.
[01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.770] So
[01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:20.170] what
[01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:20.410] you're
[01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:20.890] suggesting
[01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:21.290] is
[01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:21.710] to
[01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:23.010] generate
[01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:23.290] the
[01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:23.530] load
[01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:24.110] profile
[01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:24.490] for
[01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:24.750] the
[01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.050] line
[01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:26.690] and
[01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:27.130] whenever
[01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:27.590] the
[01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:27.890] load
[01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:28.210] is
[01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:28.650] over
[01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:29.190] the
[01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.490] seating
[01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:30.150] capacity,
[01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:30.730] you
[01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:31.130] measure
[01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:31.350] the
[01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:31.570] time
[01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:32.030] period
[01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:32.530] on
[01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:32.770] that.
[01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:33.090] So
[01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:33.630] that's
[01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:33.730] a
[01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:33.890] good
[01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:34.650] idea.
[01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:35.290] Right.
[01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:36.510] So
[01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:36.810] in
[01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:37.090] terms
[01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:37.350] of
[01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:37.850] for
[01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:38.790] Toronto
[01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:40.130] Transit
[01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.710] Commission,
[01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.330] the
[01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:41.610] loading
[01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:42.110] standards
[01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:42.570] is
[01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:43.530] something
[01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:43.890] like
[01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:44.270] this.
[01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:44.510] For
[01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.810] different
[01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:45.130] types
[01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:45.330] of
[01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:45.730] vehicle,
[01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:46.270] you
[01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.490] would
[01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.910] allow
[01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:48.550] different
[01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:49.390] averages
[01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:49.690] for
[01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:49.910] your
[01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:50.370] design.
[01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:50.950] So
[01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:51.150] there
[01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:51.290] is
[01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:51.590] also
[01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:51.930] one
[01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:52.630] interesting
[01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:54.030] point
[01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:54.470] here.
[01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:55.410] Why
[01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:55.530] do
[01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:55.670] you
[01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.910] think
[01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:56.350] for
[01:01:56.350 --> 01:01:56.710] low
[01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:57.230] frequency
[01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.710] service,
[01:01:58.270 --> 01:01:58.490] you
[01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.730] would
[01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:59.690] allow
[01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.910] a
[01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:00.250] lower
[01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:02.710] crowding
[01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:03.050] level
[01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:03.410] or
[01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.810] a
[01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:04.110] lower
[01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:05.710] average
[01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:06.850] ridership?
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.760] Right,
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:17.020] yeah.
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:17.500] That
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:17.700] could
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:17.880] be
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.500] one
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.780] good
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:21.840] answer.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:22.720] The
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:22.960] other
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.480] reason
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:23.700] that
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:23.780] I
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:23.920] can
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.300] imagine
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:24.920] is
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.200] that
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:25.440] if
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:25.680] it's
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:25.840] a
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.020] low
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:26.460] frequency
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.140] service
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:27.640] and
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:27.780] if
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.100] someone
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:28.340] is
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:28.700] denied
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:29.120] boarding
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:29.340] to
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:29.440] a
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:29.600] low
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:30.000] frequency
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.440] service,
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:30.660] they
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:30.860] have
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.640] to
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:31.860] wait
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.280] longer.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:32.980] So
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:33.180] we
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:33.360] would
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:33.700] allow
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:33.880] a
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.060] little
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:34.300] bit
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:34.520] of
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.380] slackness
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:35.620] in
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.020] the
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.560] design
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:37.860] so
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:38.040] we
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:38.180] would
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:38.480] avoid
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:38.620] a
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:39.000] situation
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:39.320] like
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:39.580] that.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:48.660] Okay,
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.220] so
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:49.460] let's
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:49.740] stop
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.060] here
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:50.660] and
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:50.840] then
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:50.980] we
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.140] will
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:51.540] continue
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:51.780] to
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:51.960] the
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.280] rest
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:52.920] of
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.160] the
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:53.880] guidelines,
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:54.600] particularly
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.520] with
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.160] reliability
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:57.700] of
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:58.260] service.
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:02:59.820] Next
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:00.140] week.
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:00.720] Is
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:00.800] there
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:00.900] a
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:01.140] question
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:01.420] here?
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.140] Is
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:03.620] there
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:03.720] a
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:03.820] reason
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:04.060] why
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:04.200] we
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:04.320] use
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:04.440] so
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:04.540] many
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:04.920] Canadian
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.280] examples?
[01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:10.330] That's
[01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:10.470] a
[01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.650] good
[01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:11.570] question.
[01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:12.350] Public
[01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:12.830] transportation
[01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:13.270] is
[01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.370] better.
[01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.650] Yeah,
[01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.010] better.
[01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.470] Probably
[01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.670] the
[01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:15.010] closest
[01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:15.410] place
[01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:15.590] that
[01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:15.790] has
[01:03:15.790 --> 01:03:15.890] a
[01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:16.050] better
[01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:16.390] public
[01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.850] transportation.
