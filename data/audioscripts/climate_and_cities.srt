[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.640] And
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.840] this
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.960] is
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.120] a
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.380] short
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.660] video
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.980] lecture
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.420] introducing
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.640] my
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.340] class
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.740] on
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.020] cities
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.120] and
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.360] climate
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.840] action.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.760] Or
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.980] this
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.120] is
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.320] really
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.620] kind
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.760] of
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.900] an
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.400] exploration
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.960] or
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.320] maybe
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.440] a
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.760] rationale
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.460] perhaps
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.060] of
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.220] why
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.340] you
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.440] should
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.620] take
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.800] this
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.240] class,
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.760] MIT

[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.400].165
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.680] for
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.360] undergraduates
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.860] or

[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.560] students.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.400] This
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.640] video
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.980] lecture
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.140] is
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.360] really,
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.740] I'm
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.860] gonna
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.180] use
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.400] this
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.520] as
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.640] an
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.100] example
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.440] of
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.620] all
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.760] the
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.060] future
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.640] video
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.960] lectures
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.200] that
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.300] are
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.460] to
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.760] come.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.280] So
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.460] for
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.660] example,
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.820] I'm
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.960] not
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.080] gonna
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.400] go
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.740] over
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.120] this
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.540] slide.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.280] This
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.560] slide
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.760] has
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.860] all
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.960] the
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.240] readings
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.420] that
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.500] are
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.560] in
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.660] the
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.860] syllabus
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.160] for
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.540] today.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.220] I'll
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.580] generally
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.120] start
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.480] my
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.920] lectures
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.260] with
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.400] a
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.700] slide
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.880] like
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.080] this,
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.200] but
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.280] I
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.440] won't
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.680] go
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.900] into
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.180] it
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.760] because
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.240] first
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.660] all
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.860] these
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.300] things

[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.940] syllabus.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.820] Second,
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.600] for
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.720] all
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.880] the
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.220] students
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.660] taking
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.040] this
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.380] class
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.520] at
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.800] MIT,
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.780] you'll
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.080] have
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.260] the
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.520] PDF
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.960] slides

[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.200] site.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.740] So
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.840] you
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.900] can
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.000] go

[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.820] links.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.180] You
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.300] don't
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.440] need
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.540] to
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.660] go

[00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.960] syllabus
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.400] because
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.540] you
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.640] already
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.780] have
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.900] the
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.140] syllabus.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.880] But
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.080] if
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.180] I
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.540] bring

[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.460] papers,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.160] I'll
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.380] put
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.780] those
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.200] references

[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.240] slides.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.460] And
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.620] so
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.740] if
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.840] you
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.020] wanna
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.320] follow

[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.800] other
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.300] topics,
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.860] just
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.160] go
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.380] to
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.540] the
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.900] slide

[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.740] in
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.860] the
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.200] PDF.
[00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.310] So
[00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.790] while
[00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.910] we're
[00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.190] watching
[00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.370] this

[00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.830] video
[00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.130] today,
[00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.730] I'm
[00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.830] gonna
[00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.050] use
[00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.230] these
[00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.530] short
[00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.810] videos
[00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.190] class
[00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.510] to
[00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.930] comment
[00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.310] on

[00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.350] synthesize,
[00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.830] but
[00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.090] not

[00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.830] the
[00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.170] readings.
[00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.490] So
[00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.670] you
[00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.850] do

[00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.290] but
[00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.430] the
[00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.730] point

[00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.790] lecture
[00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.970] is
[00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.030] to
[00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.210] really

[00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.450] discussion
[00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.990] or
[00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.070] to
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.540] demonstrate
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.900] something
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.060] I
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.180] wanna
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.620] highlight
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.820] or
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.260] explore.
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.100] Quite
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.380] often
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.580] my
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.840] lectures,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.000] I
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.220] really
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.500] like
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.740] doing
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.920] a
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.300] deep
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.620] dive
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.740] in
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.880] a
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.260] particular
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.760] aspect
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.940] of
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.080] the
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.440] readings,
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.980] but
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.180] that
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.380] might
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.520] not
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.680] be
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.200] necessarily
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.540] what
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.660] we
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.820] wanna
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.160] talk
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.480] about
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.040] together
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.280] in
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.640] class.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.860] So
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.200] I'll
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.620] highlight
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.960] things
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.160] or
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.600] explore
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.920] things
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.060] that
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.200] I
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.340] wanna
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.760] focus
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.060] on.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.640] We
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.760] can
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.120] discuss
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.260] it
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.480] more
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.640] in
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.000] class.
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.460] And
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.840] then
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.040] for
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.300] the
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.620] student
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.960] leaders
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.120] of
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.220] the
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.740] discussions,
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.460] you
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.600] can
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.820] highlight
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.100] something
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.320] you
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.540] wanna
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.040] explore
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.300] or
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.700] highlight
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.840] and
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.920] we
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.020] can
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.320] talk
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.520] about
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.640] it
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.840] in
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.280] class.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.400] What
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.580] I'm
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.860] hoping
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.200] this
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.320] is
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.420] going
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.520] to
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.660] allow
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.800] us
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.920] to
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.040] do
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.220] is
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.340] to
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.520] allow
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.680] you
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.820] to
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.220] watch
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.520] or
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.020] rewatch
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.460] these
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.740] videos
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.100] on
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.280] your
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.500] own
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.920] time
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.200] or
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.540] at
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.720] your
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.980] own
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.360] pace.
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.540] And
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.860] hopefully
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.040] what
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.140] it's
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.260] gonna
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.560] allow
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.700] us
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.820] to
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.980] do
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.180] is
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.360] to
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.600] flip
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.760] the
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.240] classroom
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.460] and
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.740] enable
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.900] us
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.980] to
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.140] have
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.560] richer,
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.500] longer
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.040] discussion.
[00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.270] We
[00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.450] have
[00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.630] about
[00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.950] three
[00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.190] hours
[00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.350] of
[00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.590] class
[00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.830] time
[00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.290] together.
[00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.930] Given
[00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.070] the
[00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.210] number
[00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.350] of
[00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.510] people
[00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.630] in
[00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.710] the
[00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.850] room
[00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.070] today,
[00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.250] I'm
[00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.550] hoping
[00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.750] we
[00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.950] can
[00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.190] use
[00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.410] all
[00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.650] three
[00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.890] hours
[00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.070] so
[00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.410] everyone
[00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.670] can
[00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.930] feel
[00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.070] like
[00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.190] they're
[00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.370] getting
[00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.690] something
[00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.870] out
[00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.910] of
[00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.010] the
[00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.430] discussions.
[00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.190] And
[00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.450] the
[00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.650] fun
[00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.870] thing
[00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.050] is
[00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.410] sometimes
[00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.870] those
[00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.230] discussions
[00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.450] go
[00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.550] to
[00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.770] different
[00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.210] places
[00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.530] than
[00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.650] we
[00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.070] expect
[00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.390] or
[00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.610] that
[00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.750] I
[00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.130] expect.
[00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.990] And
[00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.330] ultimately,
[00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.730] the
[00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.850] reason
[00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.950] why
[00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.010] I'm
[00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.170] making
[00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.330] these
[00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.550] short
[00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.850] videos
[00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.290] is
[00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.390] that
[00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.510] these
[00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.710] videos
[00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.830] are
[00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.890] gonna
[00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.150] form
[00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.290] the
[00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.530] basis
[00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.710] of
[00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.810] a
[00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.950] new
[00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.250] digital
[00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.690] course
[00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.950] on
[00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.190] cities
[00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.350] and
[00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.570] climate
[00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.970] action.
[00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.970] Ultimately,
[00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.190] I
[00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.450] hope
[00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.710] to
[00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.950] make
[00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.170] these
[00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.410] videos
[00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.710] available
[00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.070] to
[00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.910] faculty
[00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:37.350] or
[00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.770] students
[00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.950] in
[00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.150] other
[00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.590] departments
[00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.770] at
[00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.010] other
[00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.510] schools.
[00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.390] I
[00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.610] would
[00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.990] argue
[00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.410] that
[00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.730] actually
[00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.930] as
[00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.290] urban
[00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.750] planners,
[00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.030] we
[00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.250] need
[00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.390] to
[00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.550] get
[00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.830] involved
[00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.970] in
[00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.250] climate
[00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.710] change,
[00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.210] but
[00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.550] also
[00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.710] at
[00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.050] the
[00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.190] same
[00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.370] time,
[00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.490] we
[00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.610] may
[00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.750] not
[00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.190] have
[00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.450] the
[00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.970] faculty
[00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.530] or
[00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.070] staff
[00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.270] or
[00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.670] student
[00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.110] bandwidth
[00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.650] to
[00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.070] take
[00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.210] a
[00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.370] new
[00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.690] course
[00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.830] or
[00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.030] offer
[00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.190] new
[00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.630] class.
[00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.270] So
[00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.390] I'm
[00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.650] hoping
[00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.830] these
[00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.970] video
[00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.370] courses
[00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.570] will
[00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.750] enable
[00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.990] people
[00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.170] to
[00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.290] do
[00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.550] that.
[00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.110] At
[00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.290] the
[00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.470] same
[00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.710] time,
[00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.850] I
[00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.070] think
[00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.250] that
[00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.410] a
[00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.510] lot
[00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.610] of
[00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.830] other
[00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.250] disciplines
[00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.570] like
[00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.970] engineering
[00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:59.450] and
[00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.930] policy
[00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.630] could
[00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.030] benefit
[00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.370] from
[00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.750] focusing
[00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.010] on
[00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.410] cities
[00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.730] because
[00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.230] cities,
[00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.590] I'll
[00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.910] argue
[00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.130] to
[00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.270] in
[00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.490] this
[00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.930] next
[00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.130] few
[00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.630] slides,
[00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.250] are
[00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.450] a
[00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.770] key
[00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.310] scale
[00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.610] or
[00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.190] jurisdiction
[00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.510] at
[00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.650] which
[00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.810] we
[00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.950] can
[00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.390] have
[00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.690] a
[00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.910] lot
[00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.150] of
[00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.730] opportunities
[00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.470] to
[00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.850] take
[00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.270] climate
[00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.670] action.
[00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.250] So
[00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.610] one
[00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.930] reading
[00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:15.030] I
[00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.110] just
[00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.210] wanna
[00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.630] focus
[00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.770] in
[00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.910] on
[00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.070] just
[00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.210] to
[00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.550] demonstrate
[00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.910] how
[00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.030] I'm
[00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.290] going
[00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.810] to
[00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.330] delve
[00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.830] deeper
[00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.150] into
[00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.430] certain
[00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.750] readings.
[00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.570] I
[00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.710] wanna
[00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.110] introduce
[00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.350] the
[00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.710] textbook
[00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.990] for
[00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.170] this
[00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.510] class.
[00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.750] It's
[00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.070] a
[00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.350] book
[00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.590] by
[00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.930] David
[00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:24.470] Mackay.
[00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.230] He
[00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.330] was
[00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.550] a
[00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.850] British
[00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.370] physicist.
[00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.310] I
[00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.470] think
[00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.570] he
[00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.670] was
[00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.830] a
[00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.050] Royal
[00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.750] astronomer
[00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.970] or
[00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.070] a
[00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.170] Royal
[00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.590] physicist
[00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.970] at
[00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.170] some
[00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.490] point
[00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.310] in
[00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.970] the
[00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:32.190] UK.
[00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.670] He
[00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.950] wrote
[00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.130] this
[00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.310] book
[00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.470] in
[00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.630] 2009,
[00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.310] and
[00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.750] unfortunately
[00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.990] he
[00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.230] passed
[00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.450] away
[00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.570] at
[00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.610] a
[00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.910] relatively
[00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.230] young
[00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.530] age
[00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.670] in
[00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.250] 2016.
[00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.390] But
[00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.810] this
[00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.130] book
[00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.270] is
[00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.490] actually
[00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.650] a
[00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.830] fairly
[00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.030] good
[00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.370] legacy.
[00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.630] It
[00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.750] was
[00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.070] wildly
[00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.510] popular
[00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.790] then.
[00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:43.090] It's
[00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.350] still
[00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.650] fairly
[00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.070] popular
[00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.410] now,
[00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.950] even
[00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.490] 13
[00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.650] or
[00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.970] 14
[00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.410] years
[00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.670] later.
[00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.790] And
[00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.110] it's
[00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.470] popular
[00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.650] for
[00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.830] lots
[00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.930] of
[00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.190] reasons.
[00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.910] It's
[00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.390] accessible.
[00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.790] David
[00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.350] Mackay
[00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.630] made
[00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.830] this
[00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.050] book
[00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.510] free,
[00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.010] actually.
[00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.570] He
[00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.910] put
[00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.010] as
[00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.150] a
[00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.390] PDF
[00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.770] on
[00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.890] the
[00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.110] web.
[00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.010] It's
[00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.290] actually
[00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.810] fairly
[00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.250] funny.
[00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.650] A
[00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.790] lot
[00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.870] of
[00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.230] students
[00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.590] find
[00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.750] this
[00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.990] book
[00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.390] quite
[00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.910] entertaining.
[00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.530] The
[00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.130] evaluations
[00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.430] for
[00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.490] the
[00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.670] course
[00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.010] always
[00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.570] highlight
[00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.850] this
[00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.690] textbook.
[00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.210] Students
[00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.490] really
[00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.790] enjoy
[00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.030] reading
[00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.250] this
[00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.610] textbook,
[00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.810] so
[00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.890] I
[00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.050] hope
[00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.210] you
[00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.370] do
[00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.650] too.
[00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.750] It
[00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.050] actually
[00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.410] uses
[00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.810] a
[00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.030] fairly
[00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.470] simple
[00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.710] but
[00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.190] powerful
[00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.610] back
[00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.710]-of
[00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.810]-the
[00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.050]-envelope
[00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.590] reasoning.
[00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.950] David
[00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:14.290] Mackay

[00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.890] always
[00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:15.110] starts
[00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.270] with
[00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.570] fairly
[00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.970] basic
[00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:16.370] physical
[00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.910] principles,
[00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.770] looks
[00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.890] at
[00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.250] empirical
[00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.610] data,
[00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:19.110] and
[00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.590] uses
[00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.030] simple
[00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.450] reasoning
[00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.630] or
[00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.270] calculations
[00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.630] or
[00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.050] graphics
[00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.430] to
[00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.070] enable
[00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.330] people
[00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.510] to
[00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.890] understand
[00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:25.130] the
[00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.370] key
[00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.770] issues
[00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.350] involved.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.400] I
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.680] have
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.760] to
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.820] say,
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.680] in
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.860] the
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.120] first
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.520] chapter,
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.780] David
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.080] Mackay
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.360] makes
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.500] the
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.780] point
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.320] that
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.460] there's
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.620] no
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.120] economics
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.260] in
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.420] this
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.660] book,
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.900] and
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.000] we
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.140] can
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.460] talk
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.560] about
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.700] whether
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.840] or
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.840] not
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.060] that's
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.260] good
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.380] or
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.680] bad.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.300] One
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.580] thing
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.740] that
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.120] has
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.560] wildly
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.060] changed
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.280] since
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.960] 2009
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.280] is
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.440] the
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.920] cost
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.100] of
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.360] renewable
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.040] energies
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.460] and
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.080] technologies,
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.340] or
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.540] renewable
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.820] energy
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.320] technologies,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.540] have
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.900] all
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.420] declined
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.620] since
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.320] 2009.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.040] That's
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.200] become
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.380] a
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.640] huge
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.040] advantage
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.380] for
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.880] renewable
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.260] energy
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.680] over
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.200] fossil
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.540] fuel
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.100] energies,
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.180] and
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.420] that's
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.580] why
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.760] the
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.000] energy
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.520] transition
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.720] is
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.880] going
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.040] to
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.280] happen
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.740] more
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.880] and
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.020] more
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.420] rapidly
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.660] in
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.800] our
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.260] lifetimes.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.740] So
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.800] we
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.880] can
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.200] discuss
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.400] whether
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.560] or
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.560] not
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.660] it's
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.800] good
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.940] or
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.120] bad
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.320] that
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.320] this
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.620] textbook
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.820] has
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.000] no
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.520] economics.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.300] It
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.660] simply
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.140] focuses
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.500] on
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.740] the
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.360] technological
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.820] issues
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.220] involved
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.900] rather
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.000] than
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.100] the
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.380] economic
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.880] issues.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.000] Similarly,
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.220] it
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.420] really
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.760] doesn't
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.100] focus
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.340] on
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.480] the
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.960] political
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.280] or
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.820] policy
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.360] aspects
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.000] of
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.220] some
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.320] of
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.440] these
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.000] technologies.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.040] This
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.260] is
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.780] perhaps
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.580] before,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.600] well,
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.920] climate
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.180] change
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.300] has
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.440] always
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.580] been
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.840] fairly
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.480] polarized
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.680] in
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.780] the
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.080] US
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.360] in
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.440] a
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.560] way
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.760] that's
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.960] not
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.420] polarized
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.540] in
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.700] other
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.100] countries,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.740] but
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.640] David
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.980] Mackay
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.240] makes
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.380] an
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.620] effort
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.800] in
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.960] this
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.160] book
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.540] basically
[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.820] not
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.000] to
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.400] focus
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.540] on
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.120] politics
[00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.840] as
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.120] much
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.320] as
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.580] on
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.900] the
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.420] physical
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.580] or
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.080] technological
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.560] solutions
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.780] we
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.140] need.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.680] He
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.900] sort
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.000] of
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.420] assumes
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.620] that
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.980] that'll
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.360] help
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.760] drive
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.900] the
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.460] conversation
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.780] or
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.040] help
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.360] drive
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.520] the
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.820] policy
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.200] changes
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.520] needed.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.600] Obviously,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.020] we
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.420] haven't
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.560] had
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.700] the
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.920] policy
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.300] changes
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.460] we
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.700] needed
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.000] in
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.160] the
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.540] US,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.340] and
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.840] Europe
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.120] is
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.660] slightly
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.080] ahead,
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.580] but
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.960] perhaps
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.120] has
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.280] not
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.600] moved
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.760] as
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.980] quickly
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.200] as
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.340] we'd
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.520] like
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.640] it
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.780] to
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.020] also.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.420] So
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.640] we
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.780] can
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.180] discuss
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.320] in
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.460] this
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.860] class
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.020] whether
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.140] or
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.160] not
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.300] we
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.580] think
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.140] the
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.320] kind
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.400] of
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.040] lack
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.220] of
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.920] emphasis
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.400] on
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.100] politics
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.440] and
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.860] policy
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.120] is
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.380] also
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.840] appropriate.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.620] But
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.720] let
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.820] me
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.000] show
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.120] you
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.260] some
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.340] of
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.420] the
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.720] strengths
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.860] of
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.980] the
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.160] book,
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.300] and
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.440] I'll
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.820] use
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.440] one
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.860] example
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.020] I
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.180] really
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.440] like.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.920] I
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.220] really,
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.500] oh,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.740] let
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.860] me,
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.180] before
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.300] I
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.400] do
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.640] that,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.120] I'll
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.280] just
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.440] show
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.520] you
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.680] that,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.780] you
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.860] know,
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.260] because
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.440] it's
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.860] accessible,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.320] because
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.500] he
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.620] made
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.740] the
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.020] PDF
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.440] free,
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.060] you
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.140] can
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.460] download
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.620] the
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.840] PDF
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.000] for
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.260] free
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.480] on
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.600] the
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.000] website,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.720] shows
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.020] you
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.340] where
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.620] to
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.880] buy
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.000] it
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.120] in
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.500] paper.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.120] But,
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.200] you
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.240] know,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.400] this
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.500] is
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.740] actually
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.920] a
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.300] volunteer
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.040] thing
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.240] that
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.620] somebody
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.060] read
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.220] the
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.440] book,
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.220] liked
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.360] it
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.600] enough,
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.760] and
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.100] because
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.480] the
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.960] content
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.220] was
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.520] free,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.220] made
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.420] a
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.600] separate
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.900] webpage
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.360] for
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.560] every
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.780] single
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.180] chapter.
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.440] So
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.600] you
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.740] can
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.040] access
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.280] this
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.500] book
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.720] through
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.940] the

[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.900] on
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.260] download,
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.920] you
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.080] can
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.420] buy
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.580] a
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.840] hard
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.200] copy,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.480] I'll
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.680] show
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.800] you
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.900] a
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:20.040] hard
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.400] copy
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.560] in
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.820] class
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:21.080] today,
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.620] or
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.720] we
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.840] can
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.000] simply
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.180] look
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.260] at
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.360] the
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.900] webpages
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.520] or
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.660] you
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.800] can
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.920] do
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.100] some
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.620] combination
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.820] of
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.940] all
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.140] three
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.300] to
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.540] access
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.760] the
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.920] book.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.200] That's
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.340] why
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.500] it's
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.700] quite
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.140] accessible.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.980] And
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.200] it's
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.360] been
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.860] translated
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.520] into,
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.740] it
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.880] looks
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.140] like
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.560] 10
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.680] or
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.960] 12
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.180] other
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.540] languages.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.420] To
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.740] show
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.060] you
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.500] one
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.900] aspect
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.200] of

[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.440] I
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.580] really
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.880] like,
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.060] I
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.260] like
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.420] the
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.820] use
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.040] of

[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.020] Mackay's
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.340] work.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.840] You
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.960] can
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.060] see
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.300] the
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.480] very
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.760] simple

[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.540] on
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.660] the
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:41.960] vertical
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.360] axis
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.740] is
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.060] carbon
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.400] dioxide
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.160] concentration
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.440] in
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.480] the
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.860] atmosphere,
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.560] on
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.640] the
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.900] horizontal
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.360] axis
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.660] is
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.000] time,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.600] going
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.820] all
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.940] the
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.980] way
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.340] back
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.720] to
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.500] like
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.660] about
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.120] 1000
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.500] AD.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.480] He
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.920] focuses
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.260] on
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.420] this
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.620] little
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.060] section,
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.400] which
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.820] is
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.180] between
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.720] 1600

[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.140] And
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.280] this
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.760] puckish
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.180] commentary
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.320] in
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.420] the
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.920] caption
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.240] here
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.460] is,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.960] I
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.260] think
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.580] something
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.900] new
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.140] may
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.240] have
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.540] happened
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.900] between
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.440] 1800
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.860] and
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.360] 2000
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.640] AD.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.500] He
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.780] marks
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:03.980] the
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:04.340] year
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.400] 1769,
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.180] which
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.280] is
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.400] when
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.760] James
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.040] Watt
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.540] added
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.800] the
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.060] steam
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.340] engine.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.100] That's
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.200] the
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.440] beginning
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.640] of
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.720] the
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.940] industrial
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.420] revolution
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.820] in
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:10.960] the
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.200] UK.
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.000] And
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.120] you
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.240] can
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.260] see
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.660] in
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:13.880] the
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.120] UK
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.780] and
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.280] countries
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:15.460] like
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.840] France,
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.300] Germany,
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.480] and
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.600] the
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.980] US,
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.640] the
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:17.860] industrial
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.280] revolution
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.780] begins
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.640] and
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.520] carbon
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.800] dioxide
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.840] concentrations
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.240] go
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.640] straight
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.960] up,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.560] almost
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.120] exponentially.
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.040] If
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.160] you
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.400] look
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.480] at
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.640] this
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.920] graph,
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.060] it's
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.220] only
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.760] 2000.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.700] I
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.880] think
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.020] in
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.560] 2020,
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:28.920] we're
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.140] about
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.320] 415
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.500] or
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.260] 420
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.560] parts
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.060] per
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.340] million
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:33.560] in
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:33.680] the
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.000] atmosphere.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.740] So
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.080] we've
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.480] fully
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.200] exceeded,
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.780] this
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.340] growth
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.660] has
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.240] continued
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.840] unabated
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.140] the
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.460] last
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.120] 22
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.700] years.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.920] But
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.160] if
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.280] you
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:43.500] look
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.620] at
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:43.960] how
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.200] he
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.680] examines
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:44.820] the
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.060] issue,
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:45.300] what
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.420] I
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.560] really
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:45.780] like
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:45.860] in
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.000] all
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.100] of
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.200] his
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:46.520] work
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.880] and
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.200] this
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.220] textbook
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.800] is
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.980] that
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.300] he
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:49.760] uses
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.500] graphics
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.800] to
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.000] kind
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.180] of
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.640] illustrate
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.160] different
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.500] issues.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.680] For
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:52.980] example,
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:53.580] he
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:53.760] takes
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.020] world
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.420] greenhouse
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.740] gas
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.120] emissions
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:55.940] in
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.240] his
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.660] numbers
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:56.940] from
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.400] 2000,
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:57.660] about
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.180] 34
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:58.920] gigatons
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.160] of
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:07:59.740] CO2
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.780] equivalent
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.460] per
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:01.820] year.
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.780] And
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.560] basically
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:03.840] says
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.160] that's
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.280] the
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:04.500] total
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:04.800] area
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:04.960] of
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.160] greenhouse
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.420] gas
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:05.840] emissions.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:06.500] And
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:06.700] if
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:06.960] you
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.120] compare
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.380] that
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:08.520] to
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:08.700] the
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.100] population
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.720] 2000,
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:09.980] that's
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.180] 6
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:10.360] billion
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:10.740] people,
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.100] we're
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:11.240] at
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.500] 7
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:11.780] point
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.140] something
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.520] now,
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:12.680] or
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:12.940] almost
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.200] 8
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.360] billion
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.660] people
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:13.920] on
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.080] the
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.360] planet.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.160] That
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.740] basically
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.400] averages
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:16.620] to
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:16.940] about
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.020] five
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.500] tons
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:18.740] of
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.140] CO2
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.560] equivalent
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:19.980] per
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.280] year
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:20.560] per
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:20.820] person.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.120] So
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.260] you
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:21.620] multiply
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:21.920] this
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.320] axis
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:22.520] and
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:22.700] this
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.020] axis,
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:23.300] and
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:23.400] you
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:23.560] get
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:23.700] this
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.800] resulting
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.360] area
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.840] of
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:26.360] 34
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.020] gigatons
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:27.200] of
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.840] CO2
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.680] equivalent
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.040] per
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.360] year.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:30.580] But
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.420] we
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:31.580] can
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:31.820] also
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.060] look
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.160] at
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.300] some
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.380] of
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:32.420] the
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:32.780] numbers
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.080] and
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.280] they've
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:33.420] been
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:33.860] updated.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:34.340] Our
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:34.680] World
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:34.820] in
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.060] Data
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:35.260] is
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.500] a
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:35.980] pretty
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.260] useful
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:36.640] website
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:36.920] for
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.140] looking
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:37.380] at
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:37.880] different
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.200] sources
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.360] of
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:38.560] data.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.180] These
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:39.340] are
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:39.560] slightly
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.160] different
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:40.780] definition
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:40.980] of
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.320] annual
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.800] CO2
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.140] emissions.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.380] They
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.080] exclude
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.420] land
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:43.580] use
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.020] change.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:44.540] And
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:44.720] so
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:44.940] in
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.360] 2000,
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:45.540] they
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:45.700] have
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:45.940] about
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.520] 25
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.400] billion
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.120] tons
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:48.960] of
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.500] CO2
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.080] equivalent.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:50.620] But
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:50.680] what
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:50.760] you
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:50.860] can
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.000] see
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.140] what
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.500] happens
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:51.780] is
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.260] basically
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:52.580] it
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:52.940] has
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.380] gone
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:53.880] straight
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.160] up
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.340] over
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:55.580] the
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:55.880] last
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.320] 22
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:56.660] years
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.300] until
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:57.560] this
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:57.960] slight
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.220] dip
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:58.460] in
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:58.740] COVID.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.180] So
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:08:59.300] if
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:08:59.380] you
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:08:59.540] look
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:08:59.660] at
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:08:59.880] their
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.400] definition
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.200] in
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:01.480] data,
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:01.800] it's
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.280] 25
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:02.700] billion
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.120] tons
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.380] in
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:03.880] 2000,
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.480] almost
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:05.980] 37
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.320] billion

[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.400] 2019,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.280] until
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:08.460] a
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:08.700] slightly
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.180] declines
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:09.340] of
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:09.600] COVID.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:09.940] And
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.080] what
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.200] we're
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.580] hoping
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.000] after
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.460] COVID
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.140] is
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.480] that
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:12.960] as
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.100] our
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.360] energy
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.820] transition
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.420] continues,
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.140] we
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:15.360] aren't
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:15.780] bouncing
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.180] back
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:16.680] to
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:16.860] the
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.220] same

[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.080] trajectory,
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:18.700] which
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:18.840] is
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:18.960] gonna
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.280] result
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:19.460] in
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:19.680] more
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:19.980] climate
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.380] change.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.760] At
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:21.900] the
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.040] same
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.320] time,
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:22.640] you
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:22.840] can
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.200] use
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:23.360] the
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:23.620] original
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.260] graphics.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:24.760] You
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.060] can
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.340] kind
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:25.480] of

[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.460] into

[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.100] a

[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.400] bit
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:27.640] as
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:27.900] David
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.260] McKay
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:28.600] does,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.240] and
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.540] shows
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:29.720] that
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:29.880] these
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.440] areas
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:30.680] of

[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:31.580] emissions
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.020] are
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:32.340] quite
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:32.820] different.
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:33.680] Even
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:33.960] though
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.180] the

[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.260] is
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:36.400] what
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:36.920] counts,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:37.620] if
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:37.820] you
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.220] average
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:38.540] over,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:38.760] let's
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:38.880] say,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.180] different

[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.120] you
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.260] can
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:42.480] see
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:42.720] that
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.100] even
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.320] if
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:43.440] the

[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.080] might

[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.080] larger

[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:46.700] America,
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.480] there's
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:47.720] many

[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.120] And
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.280] this
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.420] is
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:53.700] starting

[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:58.820] If

[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.620] looks
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:05.900] like

[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.280] Even

[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:21.860] looks
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.080] like

[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:41.480] clearly
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.080] responsible

[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:49.660] You
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:49.800] look
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:49.960] at

[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:55.740] clearly,

[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.100] looks
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.340] like

[00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.050] So
[00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:46.150] it
[00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.310] looks
[00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.430] a

[00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.030] And,
[00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:53.190] you
[00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.290] know,

[00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.090] I
[00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:57.510] take

[00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:09.470] So
[00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.670] I
[00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.830] would
[00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:10.150] argue

[00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.610] actually
[00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.910] leads

[00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:11.530] moral
[00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.170] case
[00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.370] or
[00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:12.650] moral
[00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:13.090] responsibility
[00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:13.550] for
[00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.710] us
[00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:13.830] to
[00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.070] take
[00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:14.390] more
[00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:14.690] climate
[00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.110] action
[00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.670] than
[00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.890] other
[00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:16.310] countries.
[00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.090] If
[00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.190] you
[00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.430] look
[00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.770] at
[00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:18.510] companies
[00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.030] like
[00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.390] India
[00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:19.750] or
[00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.130] regions
[00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.390] like
[00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:20.730] Sub
[00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:20.870]-Saharan
[00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:21.290] Africa,
[00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:21.910] they
[00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.050] are
[00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:22.250] well
[00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.570] below
[00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:22.790] the
[00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:23.090] global
[00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:23.590] average
[00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.150] for
[00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.350] them
[00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.530] to
[00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.930] develop
[00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.350] or
[00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.570] to
[00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:25.810] even
[00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:26.390] achieve
[00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:26.650] a
[00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:26.930] standard
[00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:27.070] of
[00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.230] living
[00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.450] like
[00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:27.590] our
[00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.850] own.
[00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.370] They
[00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.530] really
[00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:28.690] have
[00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:28.990] nowhere
[00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.190] to
[00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.450] go
[00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:29.790] but
[00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.110] up
[00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.310] in
[00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.590] terms
[00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:31.010] of
[00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.310] their
[00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.650] greenhouse
[00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:31.870] gas
[00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.230] emissions.
[00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:33.410] Honestly,
[00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:33.610] if
[00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:33.670] you
[00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.770] want
[00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:33.890] to
[00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:34.130] achieve
[00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:34.910] decarbonization,
[00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:36.190] the
[00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:36.450] U
[00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:36.670].S.
[00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:36.830] and
[00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.110] other
[00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.370] rich
[00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.690] countries
[00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:37.950] have
[00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:38.170] nowhere
[00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:38.290] to
[00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:38.450] go
[00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:38.590] but
[00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.930] down.
[00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:39.190] And
[00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:39.410] that
[00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.590] is
[00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.750] the
[00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.090] crux
[00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:40.350] of
[00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:40.470] our
[00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.710] energy
[00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.250] transition
[00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.050] challenge
[00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.310] going
[00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.690] forward.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:43.800] And
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.140] so
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.100] let's
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.340] talk
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:45.500] about
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:45.720] why
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:45.860] we
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.200] focus
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.380] on
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:46.760] cities.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:47.580] Quite
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.000] often
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.120] at
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.400] MIT,
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:48.900] this
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.100] is
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:49.600] a

[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.300] skills,
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:52.980] but
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.480] what
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.020] we
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.260] talk
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:54.380] about
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:54.440] at
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:54.700] MIT
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.040] quite
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.360] often
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:55.660] is

[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:56.900] policy
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.100] and
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.560] markets.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.260] We
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:58.580] talk
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:58.920] about
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.460] developing
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:13:59.640] new
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.100] technologies
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.640] through
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.020] our

[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:01.800] and
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.260] engineering
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.940] research.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.660] We
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:03.940] talk
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:04.380] about
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:04.740] trying
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.240] to
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.780] pass
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.040] new

[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:06.840] through
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.460] advocacy
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:07.840] or
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.160] also
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.500] based
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:08.640] on
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:08.760] our

[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:09.820] research.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:10.460] And
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:10.620] we
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:10.880] often
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.260] talk
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:11.660] about
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.100] developing
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.360] new
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:12.700] markets
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:12.940] for
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.640] technologies
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.700] through
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.140] let's
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:15.540] say
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.220] commercialization
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:17.840] or
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.440] innovation
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.280] or
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:19.780] creating
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.060] new
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.580] technologies.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:21.380] But
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:21.800] I
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:21.960] would
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.240] argue
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:22.420] to
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:22.460] you
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:22.620] that
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:22.920] cities
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.200] have
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.380] a
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:23.640] role
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:23.880] at
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.000] the
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.540] intersection
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:24.840] of
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.060] all
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:25.180] of
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:25.460] these.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:25.980] And
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.160] as
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:26.360] a
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.860] scale
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.180] is
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:27.980] a
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.540] underappreciated
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:29.940] scale
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.180] or
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:30.340] an
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:30.780] opportunity
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.060] for
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:31.240] us
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.340] to
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:31.500] try
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:31.640] to
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:31.980] affect
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:32.360] all
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:32.740] three
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:32.900] of
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.060] these
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:33.460] areas.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.260] We
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:34.560] know
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:34.880] that
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.620] technologies
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.000] can
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.180] be
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:36.620] developed
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:37.480] for
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:37.960] certain
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.720] situations
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.200] or
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:39.860] certain
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.620] combinations
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:41.920] of
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.340] problems.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:42.720] Different
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.000] cities
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.180] are
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:43.280] gonna
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:43.540] have
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:43.840] different
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.460] adaptation
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:44.740] and
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.020] mitigation
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:45.660] needs
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:45.840] that
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.040] need
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.180] to
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:46.280] be
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:46.460] met
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:46.640] by
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.240] technology.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:48.300] Cities
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:48.520] are

[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:02.960] Cities
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.180] are
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:03.660] responsible

[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.720] And
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.040] so
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.460] we
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:08.940] have
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.120] the

[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:12.520] also.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:12.880] So
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.440] the

[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.280] of

[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.080] is

[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:16.780] diagram.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:17.480] I'd
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:17.800] argue
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.020] to
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.120] you
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.260] that
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:18.640] cities
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:18.860] are
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:19.060] a

[00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.330] If
[00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:22.710] another

[00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.750] quite
[00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.170] simply
[00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.550] why
[00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.670] we
[00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.730] should
[00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:24.870] look
[00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.990] at
[00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.210] cities
[00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:25.410] is

[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:41.360] So

[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:43.880] simply
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.180] that's

[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.040] That's
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.120] what
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.220] we
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:47.360] should
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:47.660] focus

[00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.170] simply
[00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.590] because
[00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.810] we're

[00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:04.710] what
[00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.830] we
[00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:04.970] need

[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:32.900] I've

[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:40.820] we
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.000] have

[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:44.680] because

[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.400] countries.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.000] I'll
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.200] try
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:50.380] to
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:50.580] bring
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:50.740] in
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.240] comparisons
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:51.900] with
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.180] other
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:52.580] places
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:52.840] I've
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.100] worked
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:53.260] or
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:53.500] other
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:53.940] regions
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:54.680] as
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.240] appropriate
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.440] to
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:55.580] try
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:55.700] to
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.060] illustrate
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:56.380] some
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:56.480] of
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:56.680] these
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.840] energy
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.060] and
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:58.320] climate
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:58.740] issues
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:58.980] and
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.180] how
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:17:59.280] they
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:17:59.540] work
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:17:59.660] in
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:17:59.960] other
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.360] cities
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:00.600] around
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:00.760] the
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:00.960] world.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.100] And
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:02.300] I
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:02.440] also
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:02.620] wanna
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:02.900] highlight
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.060] that
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.180] there's
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:03.480] nothing
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:03.860] in
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:03.980] this
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.320] class
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:04.520] really
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:04.680] should
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:04.820] be
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.060] off
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.480] limits.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.140] And
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:06.200] I
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:06.280] just
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:06.420] wanna
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:06.720] emphasize
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.000] that
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.400] different
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:07.820] people
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.120] get
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:08.380] different
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:08.720] value
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:08.940] from
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.180] different
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:09.560] readings.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:10.500] For
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:10.760] some
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.140] people,
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:11.560] Bill
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.020] Gates
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:12.540] was
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:12.800] a
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.060] ruthless
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.660] monopolist
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:13.800] in
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:13.860] the
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.340] 90s,
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:14.660] a
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.080] successful
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:15.820] philanthropist
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.240] in
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:16.560] the
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.340] aughts
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:17.640] and
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:17.840] the,
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.040] let's
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.260] say,
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.080] early
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:19.620] teens
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:19.940] of
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:20.080] the
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:20.500] century.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.120] And
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:21.240] you
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:21.480] might've
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:21.700] heard
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:21.940] most
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:22.320] recently
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:22.560] he
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:22.660] had
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:22.820] a
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.080] terrible,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:23.400] terrible
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:23.900] divorce
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.480] and
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:24.720] maybe
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:24.980] his
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.480] reputation
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:25.640] is
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:25.740] somewhat
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.100] damaged
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:26.300] by
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:26.580] that.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.080] But
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:27.280] he's
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:27.460] also
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:27.880] known
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.080] as
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.400] somebody
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:28.820] who's
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.120] worked
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.340] on
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:29.680] child
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.220] mortality
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:30.780] and
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.400] disease
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.060] and

[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.440] pandemics.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:33.960] So
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.540] he
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:34.660] wrote
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:34.820] an

[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:35.480] in

[00:18:58.700 --> 00:18:58.800] actually
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.000] think
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.140] it
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:18:59.400] gives

[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.520] said
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:19.760] that,
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.020] people
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:20.280] had
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:20.500] very
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:20.780] different
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.200] reactions
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.420] to
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:21.500] this
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:21.780] article.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:22.120] I
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.220] had
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:22.560] one
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.200] student
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:23.440] who
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:23.660] came
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:23.800] from
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:23.940] the
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.160] fossil

[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.180] industry
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:25.980] and
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.240] she
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:26.460] was
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:26.680] quite
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:26.960] offended
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.280] by
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.140] this
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:28.460] article
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:28.660] that
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:28.780] she
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.060] called
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:29.260] Our
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:29.660] Race's

[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:30.660] Industry,
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:30.960] which
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.640] wasn't
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:31.940] actually
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.060] the
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.240] title
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:32.340] of
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:32.420] the
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:32.780] article,
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.360] but
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:33.520] just
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:33.960] shows
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.140] you
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:34.520] how
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.200] this
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:35.680] label
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.280] of
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:36.660] labeling
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:36.840] the

[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.500] system
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:37.860] as
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.360] racist,
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:39.020] she
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:39.360] took
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:39.660] quite
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.140] personally.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:40.740] And
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:40.840] so
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:40.940] I
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.040] wanna
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.360] emphasize
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:41.600] that,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:41.960] you
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.120] could
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.340] look
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:42.460] at
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:42.680] both
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:42.860] these
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.180] articles
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:43.460] by
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:43.660] Bill
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:43.980] Gates
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.440] or
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:44.920] Jefferson
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.140] and
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.440] Stokes,
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:45.900] and
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.000] you
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.080] could
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.200] have
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:46.420] different
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:46.840] reactions
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.060] to
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.260] them.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:47.620] But
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:47.740] what
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:47.800] I
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.000] want
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.140] us
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.240] to
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:48.340] do
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:48.500] is
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:48.700] try
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:48.820] to
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.240] read
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:49.620] lots
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:49.740] of
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:49.960] different
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.440] viewpoints
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.060] and
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:51.460] engage
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:51.700] with
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:51.880] them
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.120] and
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:52.480] think
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:52.980] through
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:53.840] what
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:53.980] we
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.240] agree
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:54.440] with,
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:54.540] what
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:54.660] we
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:54.940] don't
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.160] agree
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:55.440] with,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:55.780] and
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:55.960] use
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.080] that
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:56.220] to
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:56.440] shape
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:56.560] our
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:56.680] own
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.140] viewpoints.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:57.980] And
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.260] this
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.380] is
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:58.560] just
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:58.680] to
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:58.920] emphasize
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.320] that,
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:19:59.560] the

[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:04.380] To
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:04.660] develop
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:04.760] your

[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:05.920] you
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.260] have
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:06.400] to
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:06.680] engage
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:06.820] with

[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:07.480] you
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:07.600] have
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:07.700] to
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.020] engage

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:09.560] and
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:09.640] you
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:09.700] have

[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.040] So
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.600] we're
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:11.700] gonna

[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.180] I
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:23.300] want

[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.460] even
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:32.600] if
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:32.680] we
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:32.820] don't

[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:34.300] And

[00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:13.110] know
[00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.410] there's
[00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:13.750] lots
[00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:14.250] of
[00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:14.830] different
[00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.310] ways
[00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.470] that
[00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.590] we
[00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.790] can
[00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:16.170] affect
[00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:16.990] decarbonization.
[00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.350] This
[00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.490] is
[00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:17.630] what
[00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.830] this
[00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.170] article
[00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.030] argues.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:19.730] Having
[00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.990] said
[00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.230] that,
[00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.430] that
[00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.650] means
[00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.210] planners
[00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:21.390] have
[00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.470] to
[00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.350] reconceptualize
[00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.570] our
[00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:22.930] role
[00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:23.310] in
[00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.570] planning
[00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.030] cities
[00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:24.510] and
[00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.910] cities
[00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:25.070] and
[00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.350] energy
[00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.730] system.
[00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.350] So
[00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.470] I
[00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.650] hope
[00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:26.750] you
[00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.990] enjoyed
[00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.190] this
[00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.470] lecture.
[00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:27.810] I
[00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:28.010] hope
[00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.130] you
[00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.310] take
[00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.490] this
[00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.890] class,
[00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:29.150] or
[00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:29.270] I
[00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.410] hope
[00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:29.530] you
[00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:29.750] watch
[00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.910] the
[00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:30.190] subsequent
[00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.730] videos
[00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:31.430] on
[00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.810] why
[00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.250] cities
[00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:32.810] are
[00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.130] a
[00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:33.450] key
[00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:33.850] venue
[00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:34.330] for
[00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:34.750] future
[00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:35.110] climate
[00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.470] action.
