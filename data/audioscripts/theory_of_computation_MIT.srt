[00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.470] Hi,
[00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.890] folks.
[00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.270] Why
[00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.310] don't
[00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.410] we
[00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.550] get
[00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.890] started?
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.440] Welcome
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.880] back.
[00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.770] Good
[00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.910] to
[00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.110] see
[00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.130] you
[00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.310] all
[00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.570] here.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.800] So
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.460] I
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.640] am
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.960] going
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.520] to
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.460] first,
[00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.190] well,
[00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.210] we'll
[00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.690] recap
[00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.270] what
[00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.430] we
[00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.570] did
[00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.850] last
[00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.190] time
[00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.270] and
[00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.490] what
[00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.610] we're
[00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.710] going
[00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.770] to
[00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.890] do
[00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.230] today.
[00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.970] I'll
[00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.150] talk
[00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.290] a
[00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.450] little
[00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.670] bit
[00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.850] about
[00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.990] the
[00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.210] problem
[00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.530] set,
[00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.550] and
[00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.710] we'll
[00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.910] also
[00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.070] have
[00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.170] a
[00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.390] break,
[00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.130] as
[00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.530] requested
[00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.870] halfway
[00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.110] through.
[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.700] So
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.020] why
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.080] don't
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.200] we
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.400] jump
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.680] in?
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.560] What
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.780] we
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.060] did
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.440] last
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.040] time
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.160] was
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.460] we
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.860] introduced
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.140] finite,
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.700] besides
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.740] introducing
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.020] the
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.380] course,
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.200] we
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.560] introduced
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.880] finite
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.320] automata
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.460] in
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.760] regular
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.240] languages,
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.600] which
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.700] are
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.860] the
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.220] languages
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.540] that
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.700] the
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.920] finite
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.360] automata
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.560] can
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.080] recognize.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.340] We
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.580] talked
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.920] about
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.160] these
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.540] regular
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.380] operations,
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.240] and
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.000] then
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.680] building,
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.180] those
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.500] allow
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.700] us
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.840] to
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.960] build
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.100] what
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.240] we
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.400] call
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.800] our
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.100] regular
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.680] expressions.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.520] These
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.700] are
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.800] ways
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.980] of
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.360] describing
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.860] languages.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.400] So
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.920] we
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.140] have
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.760] finite
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.260] automata
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.460] can
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.820] describe
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.300] languages,
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.640] and
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.980] regular
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.500] expressions
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.800] can
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.140] describe
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.600] languages.
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.260] And
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.380] one
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.480] of
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.640] our
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.960] goals
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.300] is
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.440] to
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.720] show
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.360] that
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.700] those
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.020] two
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.460] systems
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.660] are
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.980] equivalent
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.200] to
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.340] one
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.620] another,
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.940] even
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.120] though
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.280] they
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.480] look
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.660] rather
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.100] different
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.760] at
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.980] first
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.300] glance.
[00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.170] So
[00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.690] to
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.700] move
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.800] in
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.960] that
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.340] direction,
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.620] we
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.020] first
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.960] proved,
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.560] we're
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.640] going
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.740] to
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.920] prove
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.260] closure
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.860] properties
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.300] for
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.900] the
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.140] class
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.280] of
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.540] regular
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.960] languages
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.320] over
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.580] these
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.960] regular
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.580] operations.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.140] So
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.360] we'll
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.600] show
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.940] that,
[00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.910] well,
[00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.050] we
[00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.210] already
[00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.570] showed
[00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.810] that
[00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.010] any
[00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.230] two
[00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.750] regular
[00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.630] languages
[00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.130] have
[00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.330] their
[00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.710] union
[00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.090] also
[00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.350] being
[00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.770] regular,
[00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.110] and
[00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.230] we'll
[00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.410] show
[00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.590] that
[00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.750] for
[00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.870] the
[00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.990] other
[00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.170] two
[00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.590] operations
[00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.910] as
[00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.130] well.
[00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.630] So
[00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.930] let's
[00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.230] just
[00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.750] look
[00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.990] ahead
[00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.130] to
[00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.250] what
[00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.370] we're
[00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.450] going
[00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.510] to
[00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.630] do
[00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.970] today.
[00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.810] We're
[00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.890] going
[00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.950] to
[00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.270] introduce
[00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.570] an
[00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.870] important
[00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.350] concept,
[00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.670] which
[00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.810] is
[00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.930] going
[00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.010] to
[00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.130] be
[00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.270] a
[00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.430] theme
[00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.690] throughout
[00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.910] the
[00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.210] course,
[00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.490] called
[00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.270] nondeterminism.
[00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.450] And
[00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.170] having
[00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.530] that
[00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.810] as
[00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.430] a
[00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.730] tool
[00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.550] that
[00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.670] we
[00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.850] can
[00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.210] use,
[00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.830] we'll
[00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.150] be
[00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.270] able
[00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.430] to
[00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.710] show
[00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.150] closure
[00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.670] under
[00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.850] concatenation
[00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.070] and
[00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.390] star,
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.820] finishing
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.100] up
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.220] what
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.360] we
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.580] started
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.760] to
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.880] do
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.160] last
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.420] time.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.920] And
[00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.650] then
[00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.150] we'll
[00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.710] use
[00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.370] those
[00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.830] closure
[00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.130] constructions
[00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.750] to
[00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.930] show
[00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.090] how
[00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.230] to
[00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.690] convert
[00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.630] regular
[00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.250] expressions
[00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.770] to
[00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.790] finite
[00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.370] automata.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.680] And
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.940] that's
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.040] going
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.120] to
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.340] be
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.660] halfway
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.980] to
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.160] our
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.500] goal
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.020] of
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.280] showing
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.760] that
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.200] the
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.920] two
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.280] systems
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.500] are
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.840] equivalent
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.080] to
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.280] one
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.900] another.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.360] And
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.500] the
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.780] following
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.220] lecture,
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.660] we
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.780] will
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.980] show
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.100] how
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.200] to
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.300] do
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.440] the
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.800] conversion
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.060] in
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.160] the
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.320] other
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.700] direction.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.760] So
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.300] I
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.500] thought
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.660] we
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.840] would
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.020] just
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.340] jump
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.700] in
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.020] then
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.420] and
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.700] look
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.260] at
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.560] return
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.720] to
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.840] the
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.160] material
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.360] of
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.420] the
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.700] course.
[00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.490] As
[00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.670] you
[00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.050] remember,
[00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.890] we
[00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.410] were
[00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.110] looking
[00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.410] at
[00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.590] the
[00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.850] closure
[00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.350] properties
[00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.650] for
[00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.770] the
[00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.050] class
[00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.190] of
[00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.450] regular
[00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.910] languages.
[00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.590] We
[00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.930] started
[00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:04.190] doing
[00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.590] that.
[00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.430] And
[00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.690] if
[00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.990] you
[00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.330] recall,
[00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.710] hopefully,
[00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.490] we
[00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.690] did
[00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.010] closure
[00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.230] under
[00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.610] union.
[00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.450] And
[00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.550] then
[00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.650] we
[00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.930] tried
[00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.090] to
[00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.250] do
[00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.570] closure
[00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.970] under
[00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.870] concatenation,
[00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.590] which
[00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.710] I
[00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.870] have
[00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.190] shown
[00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.710] here
[00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.030] on
[00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.190] the
[00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.650] slide,
[00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.130] the
[00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.690] proof
[00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.270] attempt
[00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.130] that
[00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.250] we
[00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.450] tried
[00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.590] to
[00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.730] do
[00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.010] last
[00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.330] time.
[00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.470] And
[00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.650] let's
[00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.790] just
[00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.050] review
[00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.230] that
[00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.570] quickly,
[00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.830] because
[00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.250] I
[00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.370] think
[00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.610] that's
[00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.730] going
[00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.790] to
[00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.310] be
[00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.970] helpful
[00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.470] to
[00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.970] see
[00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.130] how
[00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.290] to
[00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.530] fix
[00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.790] the
[00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.090] problem
[00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.310] that
[00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.590] came
[00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.790] up.
[00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.190] So
[00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.330] if
[00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.410] you
[00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.830] remember,
[00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.930] we
[00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.370] had
[00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.930] a
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.120] given
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.400] two
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.740] regular
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.200] languages,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.660] A1
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.820] and
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.180] A2.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.480] And
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.660] we're
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.840] trying
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.000] to
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.200] show
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.440] that
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.660] the
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.420] concatenation
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.920] language,
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.400] A1,
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.860] A2,
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.520] is
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.840] also
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.220] regular.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.420] And
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.540] so
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.660] the
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.780] way
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.980] we
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.280] go
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.600] about
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.160] all
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.260] of
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.460] these
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.800] things
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.280] is
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.100] we
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.500] assume
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.740] that
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.160] A1
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.280] and
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.540] A2
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.700] are
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.020] regular.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.280] So
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.460] that
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.640] means
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.800] we
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.980] have
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.520] machines,
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.960] finite
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.480] automata
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.800] for
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.160] A1
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.300] and
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.580] A2.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.800] We'll
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.040] call
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.220] them
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.700] M1
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.880] and
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.540] M2
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.440] that
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.460] recognize
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.900] A1
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.000] and
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.240] A2
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.720] respectively.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.340] And
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.660] then
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.220] what
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.440] we
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.740] need
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.900] to
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.160] do
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.340] in
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.480] order
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.660] to
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.840] show
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.020] the
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.840] concatenation
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.620] is
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.480] regular
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.880] is
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.040] to
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.300] make
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.540] a
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.040] finite
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.700] automaton
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.960] which
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.580] recognizes
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.800] the
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.500] concatenation.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.460] And
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.560] we
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.800] tried
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.960] to
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.080] do
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.240] that

[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.960] time.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.360] So
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.440] if
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.500] you
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.860] remember,
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.440] that
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.340] concatenation
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.120] machine,
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.780] M,
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.060] we're
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.340] calling
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.580] it,
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.080] what
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.220] is
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.320] it
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.520] supposed
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.760] to
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.980] do?
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.820] It's
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.040] supposed
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.260] to
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.620] accept
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.820] its
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.160] input
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.500] if
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.640] it's
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.740] in
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.840] the

[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.920] language.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.420] And
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.640] that
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.080] means
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.620] that
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.800] the
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.100] input
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.460] can
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.700] be
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.160] split
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.800] into
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.040] two

[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.080] where
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.420] X
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.760] is

[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.720] language
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.180] and
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.460] Y
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.620] is

[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.060] Y
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.240] is
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.540] accepted
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.800] by
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.240] M1,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.560] and
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.920] X
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.060] is
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.340] accepted

[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.420] Y

[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.100] by
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.360] M2.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.620] Sorry,
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.760] I
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.960] garbled
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.180] that
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.360] up.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.260] So
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.640] X
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.820] should
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.980] be
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.100] in
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.520] A1,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.760] and
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.960] Y
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.160] should
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.300] be
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.420] in
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.840] A2.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.140] If
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.240] you
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.360] can
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.620] split
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.920] W
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.160] that
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.480] way,
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.680] then
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.840] M
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.000] should
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.320] accept
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.440] it.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.760] So
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.020] M
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.220] has
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.380] to
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.500] figure
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.800] out
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.980] if
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.140] there's
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.300] some
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.400] way
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.540] to
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.740] split

[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.260] input
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.340] so
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.500] that
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.640] the
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.840] first
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.180] machine
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.480] accepts

[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.880] first
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.100] part,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.280] the

[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.080] accepts

[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.760] part.
[00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.010] And
[00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.190] the
[00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.650] idea
[00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.030] that
[00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.150] we
[00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.350] came
[00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.530] up
[00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.790] with
[00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.030] for
[00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.250] doing
[00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.610] that
[00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.610] was
[00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.130] to
[00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.890] take
[00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:06.150] these
[00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.330] two
[00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.850] machines,
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.440] build
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.640] them
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.060] in
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.420] to
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.680] a

[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.240] and
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.520] then
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.120] connect

[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.680] states
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.920] for
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.300] M
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.480] to
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.660] the
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.960] start
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.340] state,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.320] connect

[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.140] to

[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.940] for
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.440] M2.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.660] Because
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.980] the
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.260] idea
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.500] would
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.660] be
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.880] that
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.020] if
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.820] M1
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.480] has
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.940] accepted
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.180] an

[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.160] part,
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.280] then
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.440] you
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.560] want
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.660] to
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.900] pass
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.380] control
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.700] to
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.580] M2
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.100] to
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.420] accept
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.600] the
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.880] rest.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.100] But
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.240] as
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.420] we
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.920] observed,
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.420] that
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.700] doesn't
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.940] quite
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.360] work
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.180] because
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.380] the
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.760] first
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.220] place
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.440] to
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.680] split
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.080] W
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.920] after
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.120] you
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.520] found
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.700] an
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.960] initial
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.460] part
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.080] that's
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.380] accepted
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.660] by
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.400] M1
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.840] may
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.060] not
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.200] be
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.320] the
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.500] right
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.900] place
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.260] because
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.500] the
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.840] remainder
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.120] may

[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.040] by
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.360] M2.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.960] You
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.160] might
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.260] have
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.400] been
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.720] better
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.020] off
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.460] waiting
[00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.490] until
[00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.630] you
[00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.790] found
[00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:53.150] another
[00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.630] place
[00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.290] that
[00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.650] M1
[00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.090] accepted
[00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.490] later
[00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.810] on
[00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.950] in
[00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.070] the
[00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.250] string,
[00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.470] say
[00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.650] over
[00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.970] here.
[00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.130] And
[00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.490] then
[00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.670] by
[00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.990] splitting
[00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.170] it
[00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.330] over
[00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.550] there,
[00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.750] then
[00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.030] maybe
[00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.490] you
[00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.670] do
[00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.430] successfully
[00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.970] find
[00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.130] that
[00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.290] the
[00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.550] remainder
[00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.770] is
[00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.090] accepted
[00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.350] by
[00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.710] M2.
[00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.250] Whereas
[00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.430] if
[00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.510] you
[00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.690] tried
[00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.850] to
[00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:06.110] split
[00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.270] it
[00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.110] the
[00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.370] first
[00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.750] place,
[00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.130] the
[00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.370] remainder
[00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.770] wouldn't
[00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.890] have
[00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.030] been
[00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.350] accepted
[00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.610] by
[00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.990] M2.
[00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.670] So
[00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.830] all
[00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.950] you
[00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:11.110] need
[00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.230] to
[00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.430] do,
[00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.990] M
[00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.190] has
[00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.310] to
[00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.490] know,
[00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.630] is
[00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.870] there
[00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.290] some
[00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.710] place
[00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.950] to
[00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.170] split
[00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.350] the
[00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.630] input
[00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.370] so
[00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.790] that
[00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.590] you
[00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.770] can
[00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.970] get
[00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.230] both
[00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.530] parts
[00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.870] accepted
[00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.090] by
[00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.230] the
[00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.530] respective
[00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.990] machines?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.480] The
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.780] problem
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.080] is
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.620] that
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.980] M
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.580] might
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.820] need
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.980] to
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.080] know
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.260] the
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.640] future
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.120] in
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.240] order
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.420] to
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.580] know
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.700] where
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.860] to
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.020] make
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.160] the
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.420] split.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.500] And
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.700] it
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.900] doesn't
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.040] have
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.280] access
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.480] to
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.600] the
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.840] future.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.060] So
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.220] what
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.280] do
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.380] we
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.540] do?
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.460] So
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.780] what
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.920] we're
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.000] going
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.100] to
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.340] do
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.800] is
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.180] introduce
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.380] a
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.500] new
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.860] concept
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.880] that
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.060] will
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.380] allow
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.680] us
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.600] to
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.340] basically
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.600] get
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.740] the
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.180] effect
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.660] of
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.300] M1
[00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.290] in
[00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.570] sort
[00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.690] of
[00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.870] being
[00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.030] able
[00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.130] to
[00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.230] see
[00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.370] the
[00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.610] future.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.920] And
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.400] that
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.600] new
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.960] concept
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.240] is
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.360] going
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.420] to
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.540] be
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.760] very
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.080] important
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.280] for
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.460] us
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.680] throughout
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.860] the
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.120] term.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.620] It's
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.840] called
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.640] nondeterminism.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.560] And
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.700] so
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.820] we're
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.900] going
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.000] to
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.280] introduce
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.480] a
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.740] new
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.120] kind
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.460] of
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.680] finite
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.240] automaton
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.900] called
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.080] a
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.980] nondeterministic
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.300] finite
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.780] automaton.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.780] And
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.060] first,
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.220] we'll
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.380] look
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.500] at
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.780] that.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.940] And
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.100] then
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.300] we'll
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.520] see
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:56.700] how
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.920] that
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.140] fits
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.360] in
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.520] with
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.700] the
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.180] previous
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.480] deterministic
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.960] finite
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.480] automaton
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.980] that
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.160] we
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.600] introduced
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.040] last
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.280] time.
[00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.270] So
[00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.590] here's
[00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.710] an
[00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.090] example.
[00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.690] Always
[00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.910] good
[00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.050] to
[00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.270] start
[00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.410] off
[00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:05.530] with
[00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.650] an
[00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.990] example.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.120] Here
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.320] is
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.660] a
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.940] picture
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:09.360] of
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.480] a
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.080] nondeterministic
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.400] finite
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.800] automaton.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.940] It
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.140] looks
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.480] very
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.900] similar
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.100] at
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.300] first
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.840] glance
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.360] to
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.420] the
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.680] former
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.100] kind,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.380] the
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.140] deterministic
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.420] finite
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.980] automaton.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.180] But
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.280] if
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.380] you
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:18.540] look
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.660] a
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.760] little
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.160] carefully,
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.360] you
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.560] see
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.740] that
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.920] there
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.220] are
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:20.480] some
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.780] key
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.260] differences.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:22.600] The
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.840] most
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.360] important
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.980] difference
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.680] is
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.860] that
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.620] in
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:28.980] state
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.560] q1,
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:29.820] for
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.260] example,
[00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.770] whereas
[00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.130] in
[00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.390] the
[00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.070] machines
[00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.250] that
[00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.350] we
[00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.690] introduced
[00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.090] last
[00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.530] time,
[00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.270] there
[00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.450] had
[00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.550] to
[00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.750] be
[00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.250] exactly
[00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:36.670] one
[00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.910] way
[00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.070] to
[00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.370] go
[00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.690] on
[00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:37.930] each
[00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:38.390] possible
[00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.730] input
[00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.110] symbol
[00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.310] so
[00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:39.510] you
[00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.690] knew
[00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:39.890] how
[00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:40.710] to
[00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.990] follow
[00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.470] along
[00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:41.950] through
[00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:42.090] the
[00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.350] machine
[00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.570] as
[00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:42.750] it's
[00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.150] computing,
[00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:43.910] here
[00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:44.090] there
[00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.190] are
[00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.370] two
[00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.610] ways
[00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:44.770] to
[00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:44.930] go.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:45.960] In
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.440] q1,
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.640] you
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.800] can
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.060] either
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.860] stay
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.100] in
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.520] q1
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:48.840] or
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.020] you
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.160] can
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.260] go
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.380] to
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:49.760] q2.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.860] That's
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.000] the
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.360] essence
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.580] of
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.240] nondeterminism.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:52.720] There
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:52.880] could
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.020] be
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.440] many
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.780] ways
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:53.960] to
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.300] proceed.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.600] And
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.120] furthermore,
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:57.360] on
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.900] q1,
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:58.540] if
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:58.600] you
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:58.780] get
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:58.900] a
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.180] b,
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.120] then
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.300] there's
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.500] nowhere
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:00.700] to
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:00.880] go.
[00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.570] So
[00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.090] that's
[00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:05.950] also
[00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.830] possible
[00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.310] within
[00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.050] nondeterminism.
[00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:08.210] There
[00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.410] could
[00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:08.650] be.
[00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:09.770] So
[00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.370] let's
[00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.490] just
[00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.690] start
[00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:10.910] looking
[00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.050] at
[00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.210] these
[00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.570] features.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.060] There
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.220] are
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:13.660] multiple
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.120] paths
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.520] forward,
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.180] but
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:15.520] multiple
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:15.820] paths
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.260] possible.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:16.620] You
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:16.820] might
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.000] be
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.140] able
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.480] to
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.100] have
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.240] one,
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.560] as
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:19.700] we
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:19.840] had
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.220] before,
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:20.640] or
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.200] many
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.560] ways
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:21.720] to
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:21.960] go
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.140] at
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.280] each
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:22.480] step,
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:22.600] or
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:22.800] maybe
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.080] zero
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.340] ways
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:23.480] to
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:23.600] go
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:23.880] at
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.060] each
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.280] step.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.760] Those
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:24.880] are
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.140] all
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:25.520] legitimate
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.200] for
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.460] a
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.520] nondeterministic
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.200] machine,
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:28.500] which
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:28.580] is
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:28.740] doing
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:28.940] a
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.680] nondeterministic
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.200] computation.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.380] Another
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:32.860] difference,
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.040] if
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.120] you
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.300] look
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:33.640] carefully,
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.100] is
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.380] that
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.020] we're
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:35.360] allowing
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:35.680] here
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:35.900] the
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.300] empty
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:36.860] string
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.100] to
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.480] appear
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:37.680] on
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:37.780] a
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.200] transition.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.200] That's
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:40.460] perhaps
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:40.700] a
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:40.860] little
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.380] less
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.540] essential
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.300] to
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.500] the
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:43.760] spirit
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:43.940] of
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.620] nondeterminism,
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.040] but
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.220] it's
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:45.320] going
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.440] to
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:45.600] turn
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:45.760] out
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:45.860] to
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.000] be
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.180] a
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.720] convenience
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.440] when
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:47.640] we
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.000] actually
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.620] apply
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.480] nondeterminism
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:49.900] to
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.140] build
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.600] machines,
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:51.760] as
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:51.900] you'll
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:52.100] see
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.320] very
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:52.620] shortly.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.220] Now,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:56.840] if
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.040] there
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.200] are
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.500] many
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:57.860] different
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.120] ways
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.300] to
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:58.620] go,
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.300] some
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:01.500] of
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:01.680] those
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:01.940] ways
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.120] to
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.440] go
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:02.900] might
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.120] have
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.400] different
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:03.860] outcomes.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.020] As
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.180] we
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.500] remember
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:05.720] from
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.120] before,
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:06.680] we
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.140] accepted
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.360] the
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:07.640] input
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:07.820] if
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:07.960] you
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.140] end
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.260] up
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:08.380] in
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:08.520] an
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:08.720] accept
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.140] state,
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:09.960] and
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.160] we
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.640] rejected
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:10.880] the
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.120] input
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.320] if
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.420] you
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:11.600] end
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:11.840] up
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.480] not
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:12.680] in
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:12.820] an
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.060] accept
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.380] state,
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:13.660] in
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:13.780] a
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:13.960] non
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.400]-accepting
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:14.620] state.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:14.800] Then
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:14.900] you
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.220] reject.
[00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.170] But
[00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:16.370] now
[00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.530] there
[00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:16.690] might
[00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:16.950] be
[00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:17.290] several
[00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:17.590] different
[00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.850] ways
[00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.010] to
[00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.310] go.
[00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:21.890] And
[00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:22.290] we'll
[00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:22.390] do
[00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:22.510] an
[00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:22.790] example
[00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.970] in
[00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.090] a
[00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.230] minute.
[00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:23.510] But
[00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:23.630] there
[00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.750] might
[00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.930] be
[00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:24.150] several
[00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.370] different
[00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:24.590] ways
[00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.730] to
[00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:24.870] go,
[00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:24.990] and
[00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.110] they
[00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.310] might
[00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.650] disagree.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.100] Some
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:27.200] of
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.320] them
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:27.520] might
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.000] accept.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.460] Other
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:28.700] ones
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:28.960] might
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.420] reject.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:29.820] So
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.000] then
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.140] what
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:30.200] do
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.280] you
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:30.520] do?
[00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.590] Well,
[00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.770] in
[00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:32.010] that
[00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.450] case,
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.520] acceptance
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.600] always
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.360] overrules
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:36.820] rejection.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:37.620] That's
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:37.760] the
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.320] essence
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:38.640] of
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.420] nondeterminism,
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:39.780] the
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:39.900] way
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.040] we're
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.300] setting
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:41.480] it
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:41.700] up.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.160] You
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:43.340] may
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:43.660] ask
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:43.940] why
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.220] that
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:44.580] is.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:44.940] And
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.900] the
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.300] spirit
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:47.440] of
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:47.580] that
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:47.720] will
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.020] become
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:48.400] clear
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:48.580] in
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.100] due
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.520] course.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.040] But
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.500] right
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:50.700] now,
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:50.940] just
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.240] take
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.360] it
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.680] as
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:51.840] a
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.040] rule.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:52.880] When
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.060] we're
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.260] having
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:53.420] a
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.040] nondeterministic
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:54.500] machine,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.400] acceptance
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.100] overrules
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.540] rejection.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:57.620] So
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:57.920] as
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.200] long
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.500] as
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:58.640] there
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:58.760] is
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.140] one
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:09:59.940] of
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.660] the
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.080] possible
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.340] ways
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:02.500] to
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:02.700] go
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:02.980] ends
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.120] up
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.240] at
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:03.360] an
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:03.740] accept,
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.240] we
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.400] say
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:04.560] the
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:04.700] whole
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:04.900] thing
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.040] is
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.400] accepted.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.280] The
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.240] only
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.460] way
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:07.560] it
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:07.640] could
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.080] possibly
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.580] reject
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.120] if
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.600] all
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:09.720] of
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:09.840] the
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.180] possible
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.460] ways
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:10.620] to
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:10.780] go
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.020] end
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.140] up
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.260] at
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.320] a
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:11.640] rejection,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.360] end
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:12.480] up
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:12.560] at
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:12.680] a
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:12.840] non
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.000]-accept
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.360] state.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.140] So
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:14.420] we'll
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.580] see
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:14.740] an
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:14.960] example.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.620] I
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:15.760] think
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:15.920] we're
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.000] going
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.080] to
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:16.180] do
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.300] an
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:16.560] example
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:16.840] right
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.020] now.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:18.620] So
[00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.190] if
[00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.250] we
[00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.490] take,
[00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.630] for
[00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.030] example,
[00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.070] this
[00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.590] machine
[00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.230] n1
[00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.810] now
[00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:23.170] on
[00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:23.330] an
[00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:23.610] input
[00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:23.930] a,
[00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.270] b,
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:25.800] and
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:25.920] we're
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.000] going
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.120] to
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.460] process
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:26.720] the
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.000] symbols
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.280] one
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:27.440] by
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:27.700] one,
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:27.880] just
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.060] like
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.180] we
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.300] did
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:28.680] before.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.580] But
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:30.980] now
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.420] to
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:31.800] follow
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.400] along,
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:32.860] there
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.020] might
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.220] be
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:33.520] several
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:33.800] different
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.060] ways
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:34.240] to
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:34.440] go.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:34.580] So
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.020] if
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.180] we
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:36.600] take
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.240] the
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.040] first
[00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.310] symbol
[00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.730] a,
[00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:43.770] and
[00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:43.970] we
[00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:44.210] run
[00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.330] the
[00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:44.670] machine,
[00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:44.930] so
[00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:45.070] the
[00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:45.410] machine
[00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.250] starts
[00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.410] at
[00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:46.530] the
[00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:46.750] start
[00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.070] state
[00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.290] as
[00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.710] before.
[00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.310] But
[00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.570] now
[00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:49.730] when
[00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.950] a
[00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.270] comes
[00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:50.590] in,
[00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.310] there
[00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.590] are
[00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.610] two
[00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:52.830] different
[00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.030] ways
[00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.190] to
[00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.310] go.
[00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:53.550] So
[00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:53.770] we're
[00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:53.870] going
[00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.090] to
[00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:54.610] keep
[00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:54.990] track
[00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.170] of
[00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:55.370] both
[00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:55.510] of
[00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:55.650] them.
[00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.710] After
[00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.890] the
[00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:57.310] machine
[00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.930] reads
[00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:58.070] an
[00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.370] a,
[00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:58.830] you
[00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:58.990] can
[00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.210] think
[00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.370] of
[00:10:59.370 --> 00:10:59.490] it
[00:10:59.490 --> 00:10:59.670] as
[00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.030] being
[00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.230] in
[00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.470] two
[00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.850] states
[00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.130] now
[00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.810] simultaneously.
[00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:03.270] It
[00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:03.730] can
[00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:03.870] be
[00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.010] in
[00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:04.190] state
[00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.610] q1,
[00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:05.210] and
[00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:05.310] it
[00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.450] can
[00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:05.570] be
[00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:05.710] in
[00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.870] state
[00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.250] q2.
[00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:06.650] So
[00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.870] those
[00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.990] are
[00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.250] two
[00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.530] different
[00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:08.030] possible
[00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.490] places
[00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:08.970] it
[00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:09.110] could
[00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.330] be
[00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:09.550] at
[00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.750] this
[00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.990] moment.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:13.900] Now
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.420] we
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:14.620] read
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:14.740] the
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:14.920] next
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.200] symbol,
[00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:16.510] the
[00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:16.690] b.
[00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:17.350] And
[00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.630] from
[00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.890] a,
[00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:18.210] b,
[00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.570] you
[00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:18.870] take
[00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.270] all
[00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:19.430] of
[00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.810] each
[00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:19.910] of
[00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.030] the
[00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.370] places
[00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:20.630] where
[00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.750] the
[00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.050] machine
[00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.550] could
[00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.070] be
[00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.390] at
[00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:23.530] the
[00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:23.630] end
[00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.710] of
[00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.830] the
[00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.090] previous
[00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:24.490] symbol,
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:26.700] and
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.220] you
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:27.680] then
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.480] apply
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.360] reading
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.720] a,
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.080] b,
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:30.360] the
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:30.600] next
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:30.940] symbol,
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:32.640] from
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:32.920] each
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.000] of
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.280] those
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.020] states
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:34.520] where
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:34.700] the
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:34.940] machine
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.120] could
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.260] be
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:35.520] in
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:35.940] from
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.120] the
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.360] previous
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:36.660] symbol.
[00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:37.570] So
[00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:37.710] the
[00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.990] machine
[00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.170] could
[00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.330] be
[00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:38.510] in
[00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:38.850] q1
[00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.030] and
[00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.470] q2
[00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.890] after
[00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:40.170] reading
[00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:40.330] an
[00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:40.530] a.
[00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:40.970] Now
[00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:41.110] we
[00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.410] apply
[00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:41.550] a
[00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.730] b.
[00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:42.610] Well,
[00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:43.390] q1
[00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:43.970] on
[00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:44.110] a
[00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.310] b
[00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.290] goes
[00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.610] nowhere.
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:47.580] So
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.100] you
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.340] think
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:48.520] of
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:48.860] that
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.540] branch,
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.220] if
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:51.340] you
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:51.580] will,
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:51.800] of
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:51.940] the
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.440] computation
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:52.740] as
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:52.960] just
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.240] dying
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:53.540] off.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:53.760] It
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:53.920] has
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.180] nowhere
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:54.440] to
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:54.660] go.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.080] It
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.300] just
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:55.720] vanishes.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:57.880] However,
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:58.780] the
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.120] other
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.680] possibility,
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.020] which
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.200] was
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.480] state
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.160] q2
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.600] on
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:02.740] a
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:02.960] b,
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:03.620] does
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.460] have
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:04.620] a
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:04.820] place
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.000] to
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.200] go.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.700] So
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.380] the
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:06.700] machine
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:06.860] is
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.020] now
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:07.140] going
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:07.220] to
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:07.380] go
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.620] from
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:07.920] q2
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.140] to
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.800] q3
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.420] on
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:12.640] that
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:12.920] branch
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.020] of
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.140] the
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.620] computation
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:13.960] on
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.620] reading
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:14.780] a
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:14.940] b.
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:15.760] And
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.160] then
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.520] it
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:17.960] has,
[00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:22.710] coming
[00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.110] out
[00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.370] of
[00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.090] q3,
[00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.530] there
[00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.630] are
[00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:24.830] two
[00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:25.230] symbols.
[00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.550] There's
[00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.710] an
[00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.970] a
[00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:26.230] and
[00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.350] an
[00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.550] empty
[00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.830] string
[00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.190] symbol.
[00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:28.250] Now
[00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.410] on
[00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:28.550] an
[00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.770] a,
[00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.950] the
[00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:29.170] machine
[00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:29.310] would
[00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.470] have
[00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.630] to
[00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.070] read
[00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:30.810] an
[00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.150] a

[00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:31.550] order
[00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.010] to
[00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:32.670] transition
[00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.050] along

[00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:33.750] arrow.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:34.740] But
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.440] when
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:35.640] there's
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:35.820] an
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.100] empty
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.440] symbol
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:36.700] on
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:36.820] the
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.080] arrow,
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:37.720] that
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.140] means
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:38.480] the
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:38.920] machine
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.500] can
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.060] go
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.400] along

[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:40.940] arrow
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.180] for
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:41.560] free
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.240] without
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.620] even
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:42.920] reading
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.480] anything.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.360] As
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:44.580] long
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:44.700] as
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:44.800] it
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:44.980] gets
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.140] to
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:45.540] q3,
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:46.140] it
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.340] can
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.240] automatically
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.840] jump
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.000] to
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.420] q4.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:49.960] And
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.360] so
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.760] once
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:51.900] it
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.160] has
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.640] read
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:52.760] a
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:52.940] b
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.240] and
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:53.480] gone
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:53.660] to
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.140] q3,
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.180] now
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.860] it
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.620] can
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:12:58.920] either
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.360] stay
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:12:59.860] in
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.540] q3,
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.420] or
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.320] it
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:03.400] can
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:03.680] go
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:03.900] along
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.080] the
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.380] empty
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.160] transition
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:05.580] and
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:05.720] go
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:05.860] to
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.240] q4.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:06.620] So
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:06.940] again,
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.240] there's
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:07.360] going
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:07.420] to
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:07.540] be
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:07.720] a
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.480] nondeterministic
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:08.880] step
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.020] at
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:09.200] this
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.480] point.
[00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:11.970] The
[00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:12.330] essence
[00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:12.630] of
[00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.010] having
[00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:13.490] a
[00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.930] empty
[00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:14.470] transition
[00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.230] is
[00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.610] that
[00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.070] there's
[00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:16.270] going
[00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:16.350] to
[00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.470] be
[00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.170] nondeterminism.
[00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:17.510] That's
[00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:17.630] why
[00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:17.810] we
[00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.090] didn't
[00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:18.810] introduce
[00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:19.230] that
[00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.130] for
[00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.750] deterministic
[00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.270] automata,
[00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.270] because
[00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.730] you
[00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:23.910] don't
[00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.230] have
[00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.490] to
[00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.210] transition
[00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:25.690] along
[00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:25.830] an
[00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.010] empty
[00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:26.250] string
[00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:26.790] transition.
[00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.450] You
[00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:27.630] can
[00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:27.890] stay
[00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.070] where
[00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:28.230] you
[00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.550] are,
[00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:29.190] or
[00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.650] you
[00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:29.850] can
[00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.170] go
[00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.590] along
[00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.750] the
[00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.950] empty
[00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:31.250] string
[00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.810] transition
[00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.130] without
[00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:32.530] reading
[00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:32.750] any
[00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.030] input
[00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.230] and
[00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.390] go
[00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:33.550] over
[00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.850] to
[00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.010] the
[00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:34.230] next
[00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.510] state,
[00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.970] which
[00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:35.090] in
[00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.230] this
[00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.430] case
[00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.570] is
[00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:35.950] q4.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.540] So
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:37.980] let's
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.100] just
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:38.240] see
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.420] where
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:38.560] we
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:38.760] are.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.320] After
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:39.800] reading
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.020] an
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:40.320] a,
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:40.840] we're
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.000] in
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.220] states
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.620] q1,
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:41.980] q2.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:42.900] But
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.100] now
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.320] after
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:43.640] reading
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:43.820] a
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.100] b,
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:44.700] we're
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:44.860] in
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.080] states
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.540] q3
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:45.780] and
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.240] q4
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:46.540] as
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.080] possibilities.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:47.920] And
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.620] now
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:48.780] we're
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:48.900] at
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.020] the
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:49.480] end
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:49.580] of
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:49.700] the
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.020] input,
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:50.460] and
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:50.580] we
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:50.780] look
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:50.900] and
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.020] see
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.160] what
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:51.280] we
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:51.480] got.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:54.260] If
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:54.660] any
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:54.820] one
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:54.920] of
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.060] the
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.460] states
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:55.800] as
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.360] possibilities
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:56.680] that
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:56.800] we
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:56.980] are
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.180] right
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:57.500] now
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:57.700] at
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:57.820] the
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:57.940] end
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.040] of
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.160] the
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.440] string
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.000] is
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.120] an
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:13:59.420] accept
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:13:59.780] state,
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.280] then
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:00.440] we
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:00.760] say,
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.280] overall,
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:01.760] the
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:01.980] machine
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.200] has
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:02.540] accepted.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:02.780] So
[00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.810] that
[00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.230] corresponds
[00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.550] to
[00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.690] what
[00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.790] we
[00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:05.990] said
[00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.230] over
[00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.410] here
[00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:06.770] before.
[00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:07.490] Accept
[00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.690] the
[00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:07.910] input
[00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:08.150] if
[00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.630] some
[00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.190] path
[00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:09.710] leads
[00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.850] to
[00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:09.950] an
[00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:10.170] accept.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:12.440] So
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:12.540] if
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:12.940] any
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:13.200] way
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.360] of
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:13.840] proceeding
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.300] through
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:15.820] these
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.900] nondeterministic
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.420] choices
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.000] will
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.200] lead
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:18.300] you
[00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:18.460] to
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:18.560] an
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:18.940] accept,
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:19.480] then
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:19.620] you
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:19.740] will
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:19.900] say
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.040] we
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:20.160] want
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:20.240] to
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.500] accept
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:20.620] the
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:20.840] input.
[00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:22.350] So
[00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.590] this
[00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.890] input
[00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:23.090] here
[00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.430] is
[00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.790] accepted.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:25.380] Let's
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:25.460] do
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:25.680] another
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.080] example.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:26.660] Suppose
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:26.920] we
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.060] have
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.180] the
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:27.380] input
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:27.560] a
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:27.820] a
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.120] instead
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.280] of
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:29.420] a
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:29.640] b.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.320] So
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:31.580] a
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.000] a,
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:32.960] after
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.160] the
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:33.380] first
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:33.540] a
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:33.680] as
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.080] before,
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.380] we're
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:34.580] in
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:34.840] states
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.200] q1
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:35.340] and
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:35.700] q2
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:35.900] as
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.440] possibilities.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.460] Now
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:37.600] we
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:37.820] read
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:37.940] an
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.060] a
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:38.400] again.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:39.380] Now
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:39.520] the
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:39.720] one
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:39.960] that's
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.120] on
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.360] state
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:40.940] q1,
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.280] that
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:41.880] possibility,
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.460] q1
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.080] possibility,
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:43.800] after
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.080] reading
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.240] an
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.400] a,
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:44.900] it
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.280] again
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:45.680] branches
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:45.860] to
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.140] q1
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:46.240] and
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:46.560] q2.
[00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:48.570] So
[00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:48.910] we
[00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.130] know
[00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:49.370] after
[00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.630] reading
[00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:49.790] the
[00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.030] second
[00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.190] a,
[00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.390] we're
[00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:50.490] going
[00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:50.550] to
[00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.670] be
[00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.770] in
[00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:50.910] at
[00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:51.170] least
[00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.550] q1
[00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.670] and
[00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.050] q2.
[00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:52.690] Now
[00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:52.810] how
[00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.010] about
[00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:53.970] the
[00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:54.290] state
[00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.470] that
[00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.710] had
[00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.970] been
[00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:55.790] on
[00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.250] q2
[00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:56.570] on
[00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:56.830] reading
[00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:56.990] an
[00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.170] a?
[00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.750] The
[00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:58.890] one
[00:14:58.890 --> 00:14:59.070] from
[00:14:59.070 --> 00:14:59.410] before,
[00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.710] after
[00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.950] reading
[00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:00.110] the
[00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.310] first
[00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.450] a,
[00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.570] you
[00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:00.670] were
[00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.790] in
[00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:01.230] q2.
[00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.870] Now
[00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.050] reading
[00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:02.230] the
[00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.430] second
[00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.570] a,
[00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:02.790] there's
[00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.970] nowhere
[00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:03.170] to
[00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.410] go.
[00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.570] So
[00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.250] that
[00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.390] one
[00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:04.570] just
[00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:04.790] gets
[00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.150] removed.
[00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:06.830] So
[00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:07.250] after
[00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.630] reading
[00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:07.950] a
[00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:08.090] a,
[00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.110] we
[00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.810] remain
[00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:10.070] in
[00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:10.350] states
[00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.710] q1
[00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.850] and
[00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.110] q2
[00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.290] as
[00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:11.850] possibilities.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.060] Neither
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.320] of
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:15.580] those
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:15.820] are
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.100] accept
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.460] states.
[00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:17.850] So
[00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.230] therefore,
[00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:19.070] on
[00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:19.410] input
[00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:19.670] a
[00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:20.010] a,
[00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.010] the
[00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:21.290] machine
[00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:21.810] rejects.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:25.920] Let's
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.040] just
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.160] do
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:26.300] a
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:26.460] couple
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:26.800] more,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.100] and
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:27.260] then
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:27.400] I'll
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:27.600] ask
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:27.680] you
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:27.800] to
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:27.960] do
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.100] one.
[00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:30.250] So
[00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.330] we
[00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:31.630] have
[00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:31.990] a
[00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.150] b
[00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.370] a
[00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:32.910] as
[00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:33.010] an
[00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:33.190] input.
[00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:33.410] Let's
[00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.490] see
[00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:33.610] what
[00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:33.890] happens
[00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:34.150] then.
[00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.690] So
[00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.030] we
[00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.190] have
[00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:36.550] a.
[00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:38.890] Remember,
[00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:39.210] after
[00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:39.610] reading
[00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:39.910] a
[00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:40.610] b,
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.080] the
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.460] machine
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.160] is
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.600] in
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:44.960] the
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.160] two
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:45.500] states
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:45.920] q3,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.460] q4
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:46.700] as
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.300] possibilities.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:47.680] That's
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:47.780] what
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:47.900] we
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.060] had
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.700] from
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.880] the
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.120] first
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.520] example.
[00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.430] So
[00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.690] after
[00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:51.970] reading
[00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:52.190] a
[00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:52.410] b,
[00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.670] we're
[00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.830] in
[00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:53.030] states
[00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.370] q3,
[00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:53.870] q4.
[00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.470] Now
[00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.630] we
[00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:54.850] read
[00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.130] another
[00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:55.470] a.
[00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.230] The
[00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.710] q4
[00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:58.510] on
[00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:58.670] an
[00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.890] a
[00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.270] has
[00:15:59.270 --> 00:15:59.510] nowhere
[00:15:59.510 --> 00:15:59.730] to
[00:15:59.730 --> 00:15:59.910] go.
[00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:00.070] In
[00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:00.190] fact,
[00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:00.270] it
[00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:00.370] has
[00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:00.510] nowhere
[00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:00.690] to
[00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:00.790] go
[00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.910] on
[00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:01.110] any
[00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.450] input.
[00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.710] So
[00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.870] no
[00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.990] matter
[00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.270] what
[00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:02.570] comes
[00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:02.870] in
[00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.310] after
[00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:03.770] you're
[00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:03.910] in
[00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:04.110] state
[00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.610] q4,
[00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.830] that
[00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:05.290] branch
[00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:05.630] dies.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:07.500] But
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:07.980] on
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:08.500] q3,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.100] which
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:09.220] is
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:09.460] another
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:09.620] one
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:09.700] of
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:09.820] the
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.380] possibilities
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:10.800] reading
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:10.980] an
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.160] a,
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.180] it
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:12.340] can
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:12.620] follow
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:12.940] along
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.140] just
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:13.620] transition,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:13.960] because
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.280] that's
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:14.440] one
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:14.520] of
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:14.660] the
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:14.920] labels
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.120] on
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.280] that
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:15.680] transition
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:15.900] is
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.140] a.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:16.860] So
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:16.980] you
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.100] can
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.360] follow
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:17.640] along
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:17.800] just
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:17.960] the
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.400] transition
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:18.600] of
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:18.800] reading
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:18.960] an
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.200] a,
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:19.800] which
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:19.900] is
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.040] the
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.400] last
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.620] symbol
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:21.800] in
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:21.920] the
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.200] string.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:22.880] And
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.040] so
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.400] now
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:23.840] after
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.320] a
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:24.520] b
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:24.800] a,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.240] you
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:25.400] are
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:25.600] in
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.080] only
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:26.480] state
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.020] q4
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:27.780] as
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:27.920] a
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.420] possibility.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:28.880] But
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.100] that
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.360] happens
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:29.500] to
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:29.620] be
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:29.760] an
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:29.980] accept
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.340] state,
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:30.760] so
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:30.940] the
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.160] machine
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:31.540] accepts.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:36.940] OK.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:37.440] And
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:37.640] now
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.080] lastly,
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:38.800] what
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.160] happens?
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:39.780] Let's
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:39.960] take
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.340] our
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:40.640] final
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.120] examples.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.180] What
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:42.440] happens
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:42.580] if
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:42.720] we
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.020] have
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:43.560] a
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:43.780] b
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:43.980] b?
[00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:46.830] So
[00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:47.310] as
[00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:47.430] we
[00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.730] remember
[00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:48.230] before,
[00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:50.050] after
[00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.010] reading
[00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:51.290] a
[00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.570] b,
[00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.090] that
[00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:52.210] was
[00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:52.370] the
[00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.570] first
[00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:52.970] example,
[00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.430] we
[00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.610] were
[00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:53.790] in
[00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.010] states
[00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:54.390] q3,
[00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.890] q4
[00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:55.130] as
[00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:55.610] possibilities.
[00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:56.370] Now
[00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:56.530] we
[00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:56.730] read
[00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:56.830] a
[00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:57.010] b.
[00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.870] Well,
[00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:58.210] neither
[00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:58.430] of
[00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.610] those
[00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.850] states
[00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:59.050] have
[00:16:59.050 --> 00:16:59.290] anywhere
[00:16:59.290 --> 00:16:59.490] to
[00:16:59.490 --> 00:16:59.690] go
[00:16:59.690 --> 00:16:59.830] on
[00:16:59.830 --> 00:16:59.930] a
[00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:00.070] b.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.120] So
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.520] now
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.140] all
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.040] threads,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:03.460] all
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.080] branches
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.260] of
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:04.380] the
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:04.880] computation,
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:05.660] die
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.000] off.
[00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.170] And
[00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:08.510] at
[00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.710] this
[00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.990] point,
[00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:09.370] the
[00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:09.610] machine
[00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:09.830] is
[00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:10.110] totally
[00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.430] dead.
[00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:10.610] It
[00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.810] has
[00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:11.250] no
[00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.110] active
[00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.010] possibilities
[00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.530] left.
[00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.470] So
[00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.050] certainly
[00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:15.290] it's
[00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:15.390] going
[00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:15.490] to
[00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:15.750] reject
[00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:16.050] this
[00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:16.430] input,
[00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.110] because
[00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.390] none
[00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.470] of
[00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.590] the
[00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.810] active
[00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:18.130] states,
[00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:18.290] there
[00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:18.410] are
[00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:18.530] no
[00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.730] active
[00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:19.110] states,
[00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:19.250] are
[00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.630] accepting
[00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.990] states.
[00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.490] And
[00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:20.630] in
[00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.850] fact,
[00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:21.310] if
[00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:21.410] you
[00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:21.630] looked
[00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.810] at
[00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:22.170] anything
[00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:22.450] that
[00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:22.690] came
[00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:23.110] later,
[00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.690] anything
[00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.010] that
[00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.430] extended
[00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:25.670] the
[00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:25.950] string
[00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:26.270] a
[00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.450] b
[00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:26.710] b
[00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:27.090] would
[00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:27.350] also
[00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.550] be
[00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:27.970] rejected.
[00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.390] Because
[00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.830] once
[00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:28.950] the
[00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:29.230] machine,
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:30.740] all
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.660] possibilities
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.000] have
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.220] died
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:32.500] off,
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:32.980] there's
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.160] no
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:33.320] way
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:33.500] for
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:33.680] them
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.100] to
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:34.880] come
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.060] back
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:35.160] to
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:35.420] life
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:35.580] on
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:35.760] any
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.200] extensions.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:37.300] So
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:37.460] with
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:37.760] that,
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:39.500] oh,
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:39.740] here's
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:39.840] an
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.080] important
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.380] point
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:40.700] before
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.520] I'm
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:41.600] going
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:41.700] to
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:41.880] jump
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.040] to
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:42.200] a
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.400] check
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:42.500]-in
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:42.680] on
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:42.880] you.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.140] But
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.620] I
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:45.760] think
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.160] one
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.340] thing
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:46.640] that
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.220] might
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:47.380] be
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:47.560] on
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:47.680] your
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:47.960] mind
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.200] about
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.420] this
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.140] nondeterminism
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.440] is,
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:49.740] how
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:49.900] does
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.380] that
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.200] correspond
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:52.600] to
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.020] reality?
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:53.980] Well,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.100] it
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:54.660] doesn't.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:57.760] We're
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:57.960] not
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.560] intending
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.020] for
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:17:59.840] nondeterminism,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.060] as
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.300] we're
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:00.700] defining
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:00.920] it,
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.040] to
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.580] correspond
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:01.940] to
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.100] a
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:02.340] physical
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:02.800] device.
[00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:04.190] But
[00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.510] nevertheless,
[00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:04.930] as
[00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:05.110] you'll
[00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.410] see,
[00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:05.930] it's
[00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.970] a
[00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:06.230] very
[00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.790] mathematically
[00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:07.230] useful
[00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.750] concept,
[00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:08.710] this
[00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.370] nondeterminism.
[00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.710] And
[00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.870] it's
[00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.990] going
[00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.110] to
[00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.330] be
[00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:10.530] playing
[00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:10.710] a
[00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.890] big
[00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.230] role
[00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.790] throughout
[00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:11.990] the
[00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.430] subject,
[00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:12.910] as
[00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.250] we'll
[00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.010] experience
[00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.210] it
[00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:16.370] during
[00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.490] the
[00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.630] rest
[00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.730] of
[00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:16.850] the
[00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:17.050] term.
[00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:17.810] So
[00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:17.950] with
[00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:18.230] that,
[00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.910] I'm
[00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:18.990] going
[00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.110] to
[00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.290] have
[00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:19.430] a
[00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.570] little
[00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:19.890] check
[00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.090]-in.
[00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:21.130] I'm
[00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:21.230] going
[00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.310] to
[00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.490] ask
[00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:21.630] you
[00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.450] to
[00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.330] consider
[00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.510] what
[00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.830] happens
[00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.970] on
[00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.090] one
[00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:24.170] of
[00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:24.270] the
[00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.570] inputs.
[00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.410] So
[00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:25.590] here
[00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.690] we
[00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:25.910] go.
[00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.610] What
[00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:26.710] does
[00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.810] it
[00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.950] do
[00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:27.050] on
[00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:27.370] input
[00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:27.730] a
[00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:27.990] a
[00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.270] b?
[00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.050] So
[00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:29.290] here's
[00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:29.370] the
[00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:29.670] machine.
[00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:29.830] You
[00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.950] can
[00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:30.110] look
[00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.230] at
[00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.390] it.
[00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:30.550] And
[00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:30.710] I'm
[00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.770] going
[00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:31.010] to,
[00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.010] hopefully,
[00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:32.390] there's
[00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.450] a
[00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.770] poll
[00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:33.030] here
[00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:33.690] for
[00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:33.870] me
[00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.990] to
[00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.130] give
[00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.290] to
[00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:34.750] you.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:36.700] So
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:36.820] you
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.020] can
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.220] give
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:39.300] me
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:39.460] your
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:39.860] input.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:42.960] So
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.080] what
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.200] does
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.320] the
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:43.540] machine
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:43.800] do
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.080] on
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:44.480] input
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:44.920] a
[00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.310] a
[00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.790] b?
[00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.290] Most
[00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:53.410] of
[00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:53.510] you
[00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.630] have
[00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.910] answered.
[00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.630] Again,
[00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.770] you're
[00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:57.990] not
[00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.570] going
[00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:58.610] to
[00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.770] be
[00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.170] penalized
[00:18:59.170 --> 00:18:59.290] for
[00:18:59.290 --> 00:18:59.430] getting
[00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.570] the
[00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.730] wrong
[00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.110] answer.
[00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.030] But
[00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.030] hopefully,
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.800] you'll
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:05.940] get
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.060] the
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.200] right
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.460] answer.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.640] Anyway,
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.520] let's
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:08.760] just
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:08.980] take
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:09.080] a
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:09.260] look
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:09.600] here.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.160] So
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.440] time
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:10.580] is
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:10.840] up.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.320] Let's
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:12.460] end
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:12.620] the
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:12.880] polling
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.300] and
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:14.540] share
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:14.680] the
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.060] results.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:17.940] So
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.120] the
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:18.520] majority
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:18.660] of
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:18.900] you,
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:19.480] majority,
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.000] have
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.280] gotten
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:20.420] the
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:20.620] correct
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.000] answer,
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:21.580] which
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:21.760] is
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:21.980] a.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.240] The
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:22.440] machine
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:22.820] does
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.280] accept
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:23.680] a
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:23.920] a
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.240] b,
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.360] because
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:26.840] when
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:26.960] you
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.120] have
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.140] a,
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.360] I'll
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:30.600] show
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:30.760] you
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:30.960] the
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.520] path
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.160] that
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.640] corresponds
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:32.940] to
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.360] accepting.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:33.560] You
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:33.740] go
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.360] a,
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:35.920] a,
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.040] b,
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.000] and
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.180] then
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:38.400] empty
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:38.640] string.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.260] And
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.680] so
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.040] that
[00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.330] sequence
[00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:47.030] of
[00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:47.390] steps
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.880] is
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.180] one
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:49.300] of
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:49.440] the
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.160] nondeterministic
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.800] possibilities
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.200] that
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:51.340] the
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:51.580] machine
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:51.800] can
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.120] follow.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.200] And
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.380] that
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:53.700] shows
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:53.940] that
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.200] the
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:54.560] machine
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:54.980] does
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.460] accept
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:55.920] the
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.220] input
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:56.460] a
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:56.640] a
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:56.820] b.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:57.620] You
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:57.760] could
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:57.980] think
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.260] about
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:58.480] it
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:58.940] the
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.080] way
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:19:59.240] we
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:19:59.420] did
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:19:59.560] it
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:19:59.980] before.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.260] Also,
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:01.800] if
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:01.900] you
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.140] read
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.300] an
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:02.540] a,
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:02.800] it's
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:02.920] in
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.020] the
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:03.160] two
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:03.760] possibilities,
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.200] q1,
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:04.540] q2.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.180] You
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:05.320] read
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:05.460] a
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:05.760] second
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.100] a,
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:06.520] again,
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:06.640] in
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:06.760] the
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.300] possibilities,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:07.740] q1,
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.140] q2.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:08.760] Now
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:08.980] you
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:09.140] read
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:09.280] a
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:09.560] b.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.240] It's
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:10.320] in
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:10.440] the
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.020] possibilities,
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:11.460] q3,
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.060] q4.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:13.820] And
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.360] that's
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:14.640] it,
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:15.360] a
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:15.540] a
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:15.740] b.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.120] So
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.240] now
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:16.340] you
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:16.440] read
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:16.560] the
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:16.700] b.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:16.880] It's
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.020] in
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:17.300] possibility
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:17.700] q3,
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.180] q4.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:18.880] q4
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.040] is
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:19.140] an
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:19.500] accepting
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:19.920] state.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.500] That
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.060] overrules
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:21.600] the
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:21.920] non
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.360]-accepting
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:22.720] state.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.180] And
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:23.500] so
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:23.620] the
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:23.840] machine
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.220] accepts.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.580] You
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:25.880] have
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.060] to
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:26.360] understand
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:26.820] this.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.380] So
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:27.580] if
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:27.660] you
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:27.800] didn't
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:27.960] get
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.100] it
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.400] right,
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:29.560] go
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:29.820] back
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:29.960] and
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.160] think
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:30.540] about
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.080] where
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.360] you
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:31.620] slipped
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.040] up,
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.140] because
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:33.380] this
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:33.580] is
[00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:38.390] just
[00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.150] we're
[00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:39.470] just
[00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.770] getting
[00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:40.170] warmed
[00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:40.490] up.
[00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:42.070] It's
[00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.190] going
[00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.290] to
[00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.030] get
[00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:43.110] a
[00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.230] lot
[00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.470] harder.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.280] So
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:45.880] stop
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.240] sharing
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:46.480] the
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:46.940] results.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.520] So
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:49.740] let's
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.080] continue.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:51.500] So
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:51.760] now,
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.260] just
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:53.420] as
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:53.560] we
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:53.680] did
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:53.940] last
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:54.180] time,
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:54.360] we
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:54.560] can
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.080] formally
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.040] define
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.300] a
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:57.900] nondeterministic
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:58.180] finite
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.660] automata.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:20:59.340] Here's
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:20:59.480] the
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:20:59.700] picture
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.120] again.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:03.840] So
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.040] it
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.300] looks
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:04.480] a
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:04.620] lot
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:04.900] like
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.540] the
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.380] case
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:06.500] we
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:06.700] had
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.100] before,
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:07.920] the
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.820] deterministic
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.100] finite
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.600] automata,
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:09.760] or
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.480] DFA,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:10.860] as
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.020] we'll
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.220] call
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:11.480] them.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.260] It's
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:12.400] a
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:12.600] 5
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:12.900]-tuple.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:13.540] So
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:13.780] I've
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:14.000] sort
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.220] of
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.300] written
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.660] down
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:16.520] little
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:16.980] reminders
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:17.320] for
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:17.500] what
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:17.700] those
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.120] components
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:18.480] of
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:18.680] that
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:18.940] 5
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:19.120]-tuple
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.420] are,
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.180] that
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:20.540] list
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:20.780] of
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.160] five
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:22.620] components.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.400] So
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:24.540] they're
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:24.780] all
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:24.960] the
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.200] same
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.380] as
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:25.800] before,
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.100] states,
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:27.680] alphabet,
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:28.860] transition
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.460] function,
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:29.940] start
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:30.300] state,
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:30.600] and
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:30.940] accepting
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.440] states.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:31.960] So
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.500] the
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:32.840] formal
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.140] definition
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:34.460] looks
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:34.820] exactly
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.100] the
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:35.340] same,
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:35.680] except
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.560] the
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.080] structure
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:37.440] of
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:37.580] the
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:37.960] transition
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.460] function.
[00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:40.310] So
[00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.710] now,
[00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.470] before,
[00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:41.850] if
[00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:41.970] you
[00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:42.310] remember,
[00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:42.950] you
[00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:43.110] had
[00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.290] a
[00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:43.590] state
[00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.770] and
[00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:43.930] an
[00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:44.170] input
[00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:44.570] symbol,
[00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:45.210] and
[00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:45.310] you
[00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.470] got
[00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.690] back
[00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:45.870] a
[00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.230] state.
[00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.770] Now
[00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:47.930] we
[00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:48.070] have
[00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.310] something
[00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.550] more
[00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:48.990] complicated
[00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.290] looking.
[00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:50.150] We
[00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:50.330] have
[00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.530] a
[00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:50.910] state
[00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:51.210] and
[00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:51.350] an
[00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.570] input
[00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:52.010] symbol,
[00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.210] but
[00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.070] instead
[00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.250] of
[00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:54.450] just
[00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:54.750] sigma,
[00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:55.090] it's
[00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:55.290] sigma
[00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:55.570] sub
[00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:55.890] epsilon.
[00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:56.350] And
[00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.110] that's
[00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.390] a
[00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.990] shorthand
[00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.630] for
[00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:59.110] sigma
[00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.670] union
[00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.030] epsilon.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:01.800] And
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.140] that's
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:02.860] my
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.080] way
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:03.220] of
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:03.540] saying
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.240] that
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:04.760] you're
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.040] allowed
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.380] to
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:05.760] have
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.000] on
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.140] your
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:06.720] transition
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.160] arrows
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:08.780] either
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.280] an
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:09.560] input
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:09.960] symbol
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.560] or
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:10.820] an
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.080] empty
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:11.420] string.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.200] So
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.400] the
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:12.740] transition
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.200] function
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:13.580] has
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:13.740] to
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.040] tell
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.160] you
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:14.320] what
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:14.440] to
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:14.720] do
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.120] when
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.200] you
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:15.340] have
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:15.680] empty
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:15.960] string
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.260] coming
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:16.500] in
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:16.740] as
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:16.940] well.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:17.900] So
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.040] that
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.140] would
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:18.260] be
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:18.460] part
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:18.560] of
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:18.700] your
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.040] table
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.680] for
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:19.800] the
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.140] transition
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:20.600] function.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:21.400] Now,
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:21.980] over
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.200] here,
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:22.440] what's
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:22.580] going
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:22.780] on
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:22.920] over
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.220] here?
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:23.600] Well,
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:23.940] now,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.500] instead
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:25.700] of
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:25.880] just
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.240] producing
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:26.500] a
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:26.740] single
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.220] state,
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:28.440] when
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:28.660] you've
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:28.900] read,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.100] for
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:29.460] example,
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:29.700] an
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.100] A
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.120] from
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:31.600] Q1,
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:32.280] there's
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:32.380] a
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:32.540] whole
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:32.900] set
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.080] of
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:33.660] possibilities.
[00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.930] So
[00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:35.450] here,
[00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:35.870] we
[00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:36.050] have
[00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:36.290] what's
[00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:36.510] called
[00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.690] a
[00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:37.030] power
[00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:37.350] set.
[00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:39.000] That's
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.220] the
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:39.680] set
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.600] of
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.700] subsets
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.920] of
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.700] the
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.260] collection
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:44.740] Q.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:45.740] So
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:45.980] here,
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:46.180] we're
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:46.260] going
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:46.380] to
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:46.720] produce
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.160] an
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.580] entire
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.440] subset
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:48.900] of
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.360] states.
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:49.820] Instead
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:49.980] of
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.160] just
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.420] one
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:50.700] state
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.040] coming
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:51.340] out,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:51.800] there
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:51.960] might
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.160] be
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:52.460] a
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:52.720] subset
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:52.940] of
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.300] possible
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:53.720] states
[00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:54.380] that
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:54.520] you
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:54.680] can
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:54.860] go
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.080] to.
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:56.000] So
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.200] the
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:56.400] power
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:56.620] set
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:56.760] of
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:56.980] Q
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.300] is
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:57.460] the
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:57.640] set
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:57.800] of
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.380] subsets
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.460] of
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.380] Q.
[00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:01.510] So
[00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.990] that's
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:03.740] what
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:03.920] this
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.280] notation
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:04.680] means.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.600] Again,
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.000] this
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.140] is
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:07.400] something
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:07.880] that
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.160] I'm
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.540] hopefully
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.200] presenting
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:10.520] to
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:10.700] you
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:10.940] as
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.100] a
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:11.420] bit
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:11.540] of
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:11.680] a
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.100] reminder.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:12.460] You've
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:12.680] seen
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:12.840] this
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.060] somewhere
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:13.260] else
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:13.640] before.
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:14.400] But
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.500] please
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:15.680] make
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:15.840] sure
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:15.980] you
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.300] understand
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:16.460] the
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:16.840] notation
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.500] going
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:17.780] forward,
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.120] because
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.340] we'll
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:19.460] be
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:19.620] doing
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:19.840] less
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.480] handholding
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:20.700] as
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:20.920] we
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.240] start
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.480] moving
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:21.820] forward.
[00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.190] OK,
[00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.330] so
[00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:25.570] just
[00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:25.790] let's
[00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:25.950] take
[00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:26.050] a
[00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:26.230] look.
[00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.490] The
[00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:26.890] N1
[00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:27.390] example
[00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.790] here,
[00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.930] just
[00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:29.090] to
[00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.470] illustrate
[00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.470] what's
[00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.690] going
[00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:31.030] on,
[00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:31.650] when
[00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:31.810] you're
[00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:31.990] in
[00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.230] state
[00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.790] Q1
[00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:33.210] reading
[00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:33.430] an
[00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.770] A,
[00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.890] now
[00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:35.030] you
[00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:35.190] get
[00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.310] a
[00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.490] whole
[00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:35.810] set
[00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.990] of
[00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.550] possibilities,
[00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:36.910] which
[00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:37.010] in
[00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.170] this
[00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:37.370] case
[00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.510] is
[00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.810] Q1
[00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:37.950] and
[00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.330] Q2.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:40.580] Whereas
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:40.780] if
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:40.960] you're
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.240] reading
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:41.420] a
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:41.700] B,
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.180] what
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:42.320] would
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:42.440] be
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:42.660] that
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.000] set?
[00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:45.690] Coming
[00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:45.830] out
[00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.930] of
[00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.270] Q1,
[00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.590] what's
[00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.730] the
[00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.890] set
[00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:47.010] of
[00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:47.470] possible
[00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:48.390] successor
[00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.830] states?
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:49.880] Well,
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:50.000] there
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.180] are
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:50.380] none,
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:50.820] so
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:50.980] it's
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.100] the
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:51.300] empty
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:51.540] set.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:53.720] So
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:53.960] this
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.200] is,
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.060] hopefully,
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:55.260] you're
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:55.600] understanding
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:55.780] the
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.040] notation
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.440] here.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:57.100] So
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:57.280] now
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:57.720] here's,
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:57.940] I
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:58.140] think,
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:58.620] really
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.120] important.
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:00.640] How
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:00.800] do
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:00.980] we
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.780] understand
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.660] nondeterminism,
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:03.060] intuitively
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:03.560] speaking?
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:04.320] And
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:04.440] there
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:04.600] are
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.220] multiple
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:05.640] different
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.060] ways
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:06.500] which
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:06.860] each
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.140] has
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:07.400] their
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:07.880] value
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.220] under
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:08.560] different
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.160] circumstances.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:11.680] So
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:11.920] one
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.240] way
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.220] is
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.020] thinking
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.300] about
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.060] nondeterminism
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.280] as
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:15.380] a
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:15.580] kind
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:15.700] of
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.380] parallelism.
[00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:17.270] So
[00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.590] every
[00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.910] time
[00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:18.050] the
[00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:18.350] machine
[00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.590] has
[00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.730] a
[00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:19.410] nondeterministic
[00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:19.850] choice
[00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:20.050] to
[00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:20.290] make,
[00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:20.490] where
[00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:21.010] there's
[00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:21.210] more
[00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:21.350] than
[00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.510] one
[00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.910] outcome,
[00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.510] you
[00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.790] think
[00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.070] of
[00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.250] the
[00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:23.670] machine
[00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:24.610] as
[00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.230] branching,
[00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:27.890] forking
[00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:28.990] new
[00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.550] threads
[00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.130] of
[00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:30.590] the
[00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.950] parallel
[00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:31.650] computation
[00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:31.910] at
[00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:32.110] that
[00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.470] stage,
[00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:33.030] where
[00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:33.150] it
[00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:33.330] makes
[00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:33.470] an
[00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.810] entire
[00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:34.190] copy
[00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.510] of
[00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.890] itself
[00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:35.110] when
[00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.310] there's
[00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.430] a
[00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.770] choice
[00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:36.470] of
[00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:37.130] possibilities.
[00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.150] And
[00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:38.330] then
[00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.610] each
[00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:38.750] of
[00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:39.230] those
[00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.250] independently
[00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:41.310] proceeds
[00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.610] to
[00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:41.830] read
[00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.970] the
[00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:42.130] rest
[00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:42.250] of
[00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:42.350] the
[00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.610] input
[00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:42.930] as
[00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:43.310] separate
[00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.670] threads
[00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:43.810] of
[00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:43.930] the
[00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:44.250] computation.
[00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:45.110] So
[00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.230] if
[00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.370] you're
[00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:45.610] familiar
[00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:45.870] with
[00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:46.210] parallel
[00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:46.690] computing,
[00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:47.250] this
[00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:47.410] should
[00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:47.590] be
[00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.990] reasonably
[00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.390] familiar
[00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.650] to
[00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:48.830] you.
[00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.330] The
[00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:49.550] only
[00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:49.890] key
[00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:50.090] thing
[00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:50.250] to
[00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:50.650] remember
[00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:51.330] is
[00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:51.670] that
[00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:52.250] as
[00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.430] this
[00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.610] thing
[00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:52.970] forks
[00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.090] a
[00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.210] number
[00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:53.370] of
[00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:53.970] possibilities,
[00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:56.090] the
[00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.610] acceptance
[00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:57.090] rule
[00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.370] is
[00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:57.550] that
[00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:57.710] if
[00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:58.130] any
[00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.450] one
[00:24:58.450 --> 00:24:58.570] of
[00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:58.750] those
[00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.370] possibilities
[00:24:59.370 --> 00:24:59.890] gets
[00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:00.070] to
[00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.190] an
[00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.530] accept
[00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:00.750] at
[00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.910] the
[00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:01.070] end
[00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.170] of
[00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:01.270] the
[00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:01.610] input,
[00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.710] it
[00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:02.330] raises
[00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.570] a
[00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.970] flag
[00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:03.390] and
[00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:03.690] says
[00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.230] accept,
[00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:04.590] and
[00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.770] that
[00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:05.270] overrules
[00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.670] everybody
[00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.010] else.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:09.500] So
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:09.940] acceptance
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.980] dominates.
[00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:12.810] So
[00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:13.030] another
[00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:13.190] way
[00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.310] of
[00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.530] looking
[00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:13.770] at
[00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:13.950] it
[00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:14.630] is
[00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.750] the
[00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.210] mathematical
[00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:15.590] view,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.020] where
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:17.240] you
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:17.380] can
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:17.740] imagine,
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:17.940] and
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:18.060] we're
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:18.140] going
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:18.220] to
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:18.460] use
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:18.740] all
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:18.860] of
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.060] these,
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:19.320] so
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:19.780] you
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.080] really
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:20.320] need
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:20.440] to
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:20.840] understand
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:20.980] them
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.100] all.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.280] The
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:21.820] mathematical
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.720] view
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.620] is
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.340] you
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:24.500] can
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:24.720] think
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:24.820] of
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:24.960] the
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.320] computation
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:25.840] as
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.080] kind
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:26.160] of
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.320] a
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:26.720] tree
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.000] of
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:27.600] possibilities.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:29.500] So
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:29.620] you
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.000] start
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.160] off
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.280] at
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:30.380] the
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:30.520] very
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:30.880] beginning,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.160] sort
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.260] of
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:31.400] at
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:31.540] the
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:31.720] root
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:31.860] of
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:31.980] the
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.540] computation,
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.180] which
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:33.320] is
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:33.600] when
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:33.980] it
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:34.180] really
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:34.640] begins.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.080] But
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:35.400] every
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:35.960] time
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.440] there's
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:36.580] a
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.260] nondeterministic
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:37.780] branching
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:37.940] that
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.380] occurs,
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:42.580] that
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.760] node
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:43.880] of
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.020] the
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.240] tree
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:44.920] has
[00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.190] multiple
[00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.870] children
[00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:48.290] coming
[00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:48.470] out
[00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.550] of
[00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:48.750] that
[00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.010] node.
[00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:49.570] And
[00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:49.710] so
[00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.930] the
[00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:50.270] different
[00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:50.690] threads
[00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:50.830] of
[00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.950] the
[00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:51.530] computation
[00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.250] correspond
[00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.590] to
[00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.870] different
[00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:53.370] branches
[00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:53.790] of
[00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.030] that
[00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:54.290] tree.
[00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:56.070] And
[00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.210] now
[00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.410] you're
[00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:56.450] going
[00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.570] to
[00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.950] accept
[00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:57.150] if
[00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:57.410] any
[00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:57.510] one
[00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.590] of
[00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.730] those
[00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.070] branches
[00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.410] leads
[00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:58.550] to
[00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:58.650] an
[00:25:58.650 --> 00:25:58.990] accepting
[00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.470] state.
[00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.670] Obviously,
[00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:02.370] somewhat
[00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:02.870] similar
[00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.150] to
[00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:03.290] what
[00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:03.410] we
[00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:03.570] had
[00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:03.970] before,
[00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:04.270] but
[00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:04.710] I
[00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.910] think
[00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:05.030] it's
[00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:05.170] a
[00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:05.310] little
[00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.470] bit
[00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.550] of
[00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:05.650] a
[00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:05.870] different
[00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.410] perspective
[00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.130] on
[00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:08.730] how
[00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:09.190] to
[00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.330] think
[00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:09.530] about
[00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:10.210] nondeterminism.
[00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:11.310] And
[00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.450] the
[00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.690] last
[00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.850] one
[00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:11.950] is
[00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:12.050] going
[00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:12.170] to
[00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:12.370] sound
[00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:12.510] a
[00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.610] little
[00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:12.910] weird,
[00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:13.870] but
[00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:14.290] actually,
[00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.530] I
[00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:14.830] think
[00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:15.470] for
[00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.230] people
[00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.630] who
[00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.950] are
[00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:17.610] in
[00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:17.730] the
[00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:18.110] business,
[00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:19.170] it's
[00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:19.290] the
[00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:19.450] one
[00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:19.590] they
[00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.770] use
[00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:19.910] the
[00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:20.250] most.
[00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:21.390] And
[00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:21.630] that's
[00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.830] the
[00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:22.230] magical
[00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.690] way
[00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.230] of
[00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.450] thinking
[00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:23.770] about
[00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:24.490] nondeterminism.
[00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:27.810] And
[00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:28.090] that
[00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:28.690] is
[00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.670] when
[00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:31.230] the
[00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.610] machine
[00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:32.030] has
[00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.010] nondeterministic
[00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.450] choices
[00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:33.590] to
[00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.010] make,
[00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:35.210] you
[00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.430] think
[00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.570] of
[00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.710] the
[00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.130] machine
[00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:36.490] as
[00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:37.190] magically
[00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.550] guessing
[00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.330] the
[00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:39.770] correct
[00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:40.150] one
[00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:40.690] at
[00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:40.930] every
[00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:41.330] stage,
[00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.710] and
[00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:41.870] the
[00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:42.190] correct
[00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.430] one
[00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.770] being
[00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:43.230] the
[00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.510] one
[00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.710] that
[00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.850] will
[00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:44.290] eventually
[00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:44.790] lead
[00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:44.930] it
[00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:45.070] to
[00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.510] accept.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.500] So
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:48.940] you
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.060] can
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.260] think
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:49.360] of
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:49.460] the
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:49.680] machine
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:49.980] as
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.480] guessing
[00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:51.930] which
[00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:52.070] is
[00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.190] the
[00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.350] right
[00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.530] way
[00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:52.670] to
[00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:52.910] go.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:54.920] And
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.360] if
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:55.580] there
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:55.820] is
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.160] some
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.360] way
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:56.560] right
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:56.700] way
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:56.840] to
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:56.980] go,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:57.140] it
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:57.400] always
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:57.680] guesses
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:57.960] right.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:58.200] Of
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:58.360] course,
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:58.480] if
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:58.620] the
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:58.880] machine
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.260] ends
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:26:59.400] up
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:26:59.880] rejecting
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.260] because
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:00.480] there
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:00.580] is
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:00.720] no
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:00.920] right
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.040] way
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:01.180] to
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:01.280] go,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:01.440] then
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:01.540] it
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:01.780] doesn't
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.040] matter.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:02.240] There
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:02.380] is
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:02.640] no
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.120] good
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:03.500] guess.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:04.240] But
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:04.480] if
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:04.620] there
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:04.860] is
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:05.060] some
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.240] good
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:05.560] guess,
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:05.940] we'll
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.060] think
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:06.180] of
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:06.280] the
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:06.500] machine
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:06.700] as
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.120] taking
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.340] that
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:07.560] good
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:07.820] guess
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.000] and
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.160] going
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:08.380] that
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:08.580] way.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.640] So
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.160] now
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.480] here
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:13.740] is
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.000] a
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.160] very
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.500] important
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:14.800] thing.
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:15.300] We
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:15.600] introduced
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:15.860] this
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:16.040] new
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:16.340] model,
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:18.840] the
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.440] nondeterministic
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:19.680] finite
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.640] automaton,
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.180] NFA.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:22.620] It
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:22.880] turns
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.300] out
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:23.640] to
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:23.840] be,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:24.600] even
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:24.740] though
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:24.860] it
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.040] looks
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.260] more
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:25.620] powerful
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:25.960] because
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.080] it
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.240] has
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:26.400] this
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.100] nondeterminism,
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:27.840] it
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.060] isn't
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:28.240] any
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:28.380] more
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.700] powerful.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:28.900] It
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.040] can
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.200] do
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:29.720] exactly
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.020] the
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:30.320] same
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:30.680] class
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:30.820] of
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.160] languages,
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:31.600] the
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:31.940] regular
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:32.400] languages.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.120] And
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.280] we'll
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:33.860] show
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:34.180] that
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.820] with
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.020] this
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.240] theorem
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:36.380] here
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:36.660] that
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:36.840] if
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.780] an
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:39.180] NFA
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:39.980] recognizes
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.300] A,
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:40.800] then
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:40.940] A
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:41.080] is
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:41.440] regular.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.140] So
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.740] we'll
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:45.960] prove
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.200] that
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.440] by
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:46.780] showing
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.000] how
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.140] to
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:47.660] convert
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.340] an
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:48.820] NFA
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.040] to
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:49.180] an
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:49.580] equivalent
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.220] DFA,
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.100] which
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.300] does
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:51.460] the
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:51.640] same
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:51.980] language.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:52.720] So
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:52.900] we
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.020] can
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:53.240] take
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:53.380] an
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:53.720] NFA
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:53.900] that
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.100] has
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:54.240] a
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:54.900] nondeterminism
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.660] and
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:55.920] find
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.480] another
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:56.980] DFA
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.340] which
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:57.740] doesn't
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:57.940] have
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.660] nondeterminism
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:58.860] but
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.080] does
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.260] the
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:27:59.440] same
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:27:59.840] language.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:00.400] It
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:00.800] accepts
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.260] exactly
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:01.480] the
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:01.680] same
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.100] strings,
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:03.200] even
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:03.320] though
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:03.480] it
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:03.800] lacks
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.040] that
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:04.680] nondeterministic
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.260] capability.
[00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.430] This
[00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.890] is
[00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:07.030] going
[00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:07.070] to
[00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.170] be
[00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:07.630] extremely
[00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:08.030] useful,
[00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.330] by
[00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:08.430] the
[00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.670] way.
[00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:09.430] For
[00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.850] example,
[00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:10.290] in
[00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.210] showing
[00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.470] that
[00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.850] closure
[00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:12.170] under
[00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.570] concatenation.
[00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:14.510] So
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.800] in
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.100] this
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.200] presentation
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.620] here,
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:19.900] I'm
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.100] going
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:20.320] to
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:20.620] ignore
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:20.820] the
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.120] epsilon
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.720] transitions.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.480] Because
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:22.720] once
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:22.840] you
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:22.960] get
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.100] the
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:23.400] idea
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:23.560] for
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:23.660] how
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:23.760] to
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:23.900] do
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.140] this,
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:24.300] you
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:24.460] could
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:24.680] figure
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:24.840] out
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:24.960] how
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.300] to
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:25.740] incorporate
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.060] them.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:26.200] They
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:26.440] just
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:26.640] make
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:26.840] things
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:26.960] a
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.080] little
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:27.360] more
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:27.800] complicated.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:28.540] So
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:28.820] let's
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.080] just
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:29.640] focus
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.020] on
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:30.300] the
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:30.920] key
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.300] aspect
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:31.500] of
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.260] nondeterminism,
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:32.900] which
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.220] is
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:33.500] that
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:33.780] the
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.100] machine
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.300] could
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:34.460] have
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:34.880] several
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.200] ways
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:35.340] to
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:35.560] go
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:35.700] at
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:35.900] any
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:36.100] point
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.220] in
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:36.440] time.
[00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:37.510] There
[00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:37.590] could
[00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.790] be
[00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:38.090] several
[00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.470] next
[00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:39.290] states
[00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.010] on
[00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.130] an
[00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.410] input.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.100] Now,
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:43.280] the
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:43.760] idea
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.620] for
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:44.780] the
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:45.260] construction.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:45.740] So
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:45.920] we're
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.000] going
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.120] to
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.200] start
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:47.420] with
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:47.620] a
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.440] nondeterministic
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:48.880] machine,
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.340] M.
[00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:50.290] And
[00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:50.410] we're
[00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:50.490] going
[00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:50.610] to
[00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:50.790] build
[00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.150] a
[00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:51.810] deterministic
[00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:52.330] machine,
[00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.730] M
[00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:53.210] prime,
[00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.730] which
[00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:53.990] does
[00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.410] exactly
[00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:54.670] the
[00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:54.850] same
[00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:55.150] thing.
[00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:56.190] And
[00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.290] the
[00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:56.430] way
[00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.650] M
[00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:56.910] prime
[00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:57.330] works
[00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:57.810] is
[00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:58.010] it's
[00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:58.250] going
[00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.630] to
[00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:59.210] do
[00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.410] what
[00:28:59.410 --> 00:28:59.530] you
[00:28:59.530 --> 00:28:59.730] would
[00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:00.050] do
[00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:00.790] if
[00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:00.950] you
[00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:01.130] were
[00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.690] simulating
[00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:02.030] M.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.040] What
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.200] would
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:03.280] you
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:03.500] do?
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:03.720] This
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.460] is
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:04.620] what

[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:46.800] And
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:46.940] the
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:47.420] possibilities
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:47.880] here
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.360] are
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:48.540] the
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:48.860] different
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:49.400] subsets
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:49.580] of

[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.100] So

[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:58.600] q3,
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:59.140] q7,
[00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.950] the

[00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:00.770] is
[00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:00.890] going

[00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.270] q7.
[00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:04.430] And
[00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.630] it's
[00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.750] going
[00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.830] to,
[00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:04.970] for

[00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:06.470] here,
[00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:06.950] there's
[00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:07.050] going
[00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:07.110] to
[00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.210] be

[00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:08.490] prime.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:09.500] So
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:09.680] M
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:09.800] prime
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:09.920] is

[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:10.460] bigger.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:13.620] OK,
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:14.380] so
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.480] quickly,
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:15.740] the

[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:18.920] prime
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.360] now,
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:20.340] q
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:20.640] prime,
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:21.460] are
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:21.560] going
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:21.640] to
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:21.760] be

[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:23.720] of
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.260] subsets
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:24.740] of

[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:27.640] M.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.240] And
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.540] now
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:36.660] we
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:36.780] have
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:36.880] to
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.020] look
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.100] at
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:37.200] how
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:37.340] the

[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.200] function
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:38.600] of

[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.520] DFA,
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:40.520] the

[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.100] the
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.340] DFA
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:43.740] machines.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:43.900] So
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.080] these
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.160] are
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.240] the

[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.240] components.
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:46.860] So
[00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:47.970] delta
[00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:48.730] prime,
[00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.170] when

[00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.830] has

[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.940] something
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.280] like
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:55.700] this,
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.100] has
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:57.500] one
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:57.660] of
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:57.860] its
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.200] states,
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:58.400] which
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:58.860] corresponds
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:58.980] to
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.240] a

[00:31:59.580 --> 00:31:59.820] of

[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:00.680] of
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.060] M.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.020] And
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.120] it
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:02.240] reads
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.360] an

[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:02.920] symbol.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:03.400] You
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:03.600] just
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:03.760] have
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:03.860] to

[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:04.220] the

[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:05.220] you

[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:05.760] naturally
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.060] do.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.340] You're
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:06.380] going
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:06.480] to
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:06.620] look
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:06.740] at

[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.220] look
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:09.320] at
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:09.500] where
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:09.780] that

[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:10.960] A.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:11.340] So
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:11.560] there's
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:11.680] a

[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.100] And
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:13.260] look
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:13.380] at
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:13.620] all

[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:17.720] And
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:17.980] that's
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.120] the

[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.100] That's
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:21.180] going
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:21.240] to
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.320] be

[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:22.280] And
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:22.480] that's
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:22.580] going
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:22.640] to
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:22.740] be

[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.340] OK,
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:26.640] so
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:26.780] it's

[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.340] that
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:31.600] could
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:31.820] be
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:32.160] in
[00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.190] when
[00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.290] you
[00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:34.550] apply
[00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:34.750] the

[00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:35.690] function
[00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:36.370] of

[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.100] It's
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:46.220] a
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:46.360] little

[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:49.660] I
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.040] suggest
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:50.160] you
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:50.380] look
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:50.480] at
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:50.640] this
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:50.760] if
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:50.860] you
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.000] didn't
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:51.180] quite
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:51.380] get
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:51.660] it
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.120] after
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:52.320] the
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:52.540] fact.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:53.520] Good
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:53.660] to
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.080] understand.

[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.560] subset
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:00.940] now
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:01.160] we're

[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:02.300] It's
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:02.400] going

[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.060] to
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.200] be
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.480] all
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.600] of

[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:18.860] that
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:19.080] have
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:19.240] at

[00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:25.090] So
[00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:25.190] I
[00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.330] hope
[00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:25.450] you
[00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:25.590] got
[00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.810] that,
[00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.990] because
[00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.170] I'm
[00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:26.250] going
[00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:26.370] to
[00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:26.690] give
[00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.790] you
[00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:26.950] another
[00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:27.210] little
[00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:27.450] check
[00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:27.570]-in
[00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:27.910] here,
[00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.990] which
[00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.090] is
[00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.250] I'm
[00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:29.330] going
[00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.410] to
[00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:29.650] ask
[00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:29.810] you,
[00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:30.290] how
[00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:30.710] big
[00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.990] is
[00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:31.170] M
[00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:31.330] prime?
[00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:31.610] How
[00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.790] many
[00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:32.070] states
[00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.230] does
[00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.390] M
[00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:32.590] prime
[00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.890] have?
[00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:33.690] I
[00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:33.870] told
[00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:33.950] you
[00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:34.090] what
[00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:34.250] those
[00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.490] states
[00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.830] are,
[00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:35.530] so
[00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:35.710] just
[00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:35.890] go
[00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:36.490] think
[00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:36.690] about
[00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:37.270] that.
[00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.850] So
[00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:41.130] check
[00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:41.290]-in
[00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:41.530] two.
[00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:41.790] If
[00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.010] M
[00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:42.250] has
[00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:42.570] n
[00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:42.970] states,
[00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.450] how
[00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:43.630] many
[00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:43.910] states
[00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:44.030] does
[00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:44.230] M
[00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.470] prime
[00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.830] have
[00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:45.150] by
[00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:45.370] this
[00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:45.810] construction?
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:47.520] So
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:47.740] let's
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.000] launch
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:48.180] the
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:48.400] next
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:48.860] poll.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:33:59.560] OK,
[00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:00.390] five
[00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:00.750] seconds.
[00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:01.830] I
[00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.930] think
[00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:02.030] we're
[00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:02.230] almost
[00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.470] done
[00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.690] here.
[00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:06.690] All
[00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:06.930] right,
[00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.330] share
[00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:07.830] results.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.220] I
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:10.320] don't
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:10.400] know
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:10.440] if
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:10.680] sharing
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.020] results
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:11.180] is
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:11.260] a
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:11.340] good
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:11.480] thing.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:11.640] I'm
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:11.820] not
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.040] trying
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:12.140] to
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:12.320] make
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:12.600] you,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.080] if
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:13.180] you
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:13.280] didn't
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:13.440] get
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:13.580] the
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:13.740] right
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:14.080] answer,
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.340] because
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:15.580] most
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:15.680] of
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:15.740] the
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:15.900] people
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.080] did
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.220] get
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:16.340] the
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:16.480] right
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:16.680] answer.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:16.780] If
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:16.800] you
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:16.940] didn't
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:17.080] get
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.200] the
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:17.340] right
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:17.480] answer,
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:17.520] I'm
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:17.660] trying
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:17.740] to
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:17.880] make
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:17.960] you
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.160] feel
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:18.440] bad.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:18.660] But
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:18.820] I
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:18.980] do
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.240] think
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:19.400] you
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:19.640] should,
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:20.240] it's
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:20.340] a
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:20.500] little
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:20.680] bit
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:20.820] of
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:20.900] a
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.260] suggestion
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:21.900] that
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.080] you
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.460] need
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:22.600] to
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:22.880] review
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.100] some
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:23.360] basic
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:23.740] concepts.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:24.620] So
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:24.760] the
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:24.980] basic
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.360] concept
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:25.740] here
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:25.960] is,
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:26.120] if
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:26.200] you
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:26.380] have
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:26.520] a
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:26.900] collection,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.300] if
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.300] you
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.420] have
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:27.540] a
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:27.660] set
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:27.840] of
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.160] states,
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:28.840] how
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.020] many
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:29.560] subsets
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.480] are
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:30.740] there?
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:31.380] And
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:31.500] the
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:31.660] number
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:31.820] of
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.160] subsets
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:32.380] is
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:32.520] going
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:32.580] to
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:32.700] be
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.060] exponential.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.100] So
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:34.220] if
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:34.320] you
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:34.540] have
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.140] a
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:35.440] collection
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:35.660] of
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:35.920] n
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.360] elements,
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:36.940] the
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:37.120] number
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:37.280] of
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.680] subsets
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:37.880] of
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.040] those
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:38.180] n
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:38.540] elements
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:38.800] is
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:38.980] 2
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:39.100] to
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.220] the
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:39.340] n.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:40.780] That's
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:40.900] the
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.080] fact
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.220] we're
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.460] using
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:41.760] here.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.260] And
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:42.520] that's
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:42.900] why
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.960] M
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.300] prime
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:44.580] has
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:44.780] 2
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:44.920] to
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.020] the
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:45.160] n
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:45.520] states,
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:45.800] if
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:45.980] M
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.140] had
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:46.380] n
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:46.720] states.
[00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.110] And
[00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:49.450] that's,
[00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.830] you
[00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:50.010] should
[00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:50.310] make
[00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.510] sure
[00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.690] you
[00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:51.370] understand
[00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:51.990] why
[00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.190] that
[00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.410] is.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:53.760] All
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:53.920] right,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:54.760] so
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.700] with
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.080] that,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.640] as
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.100] requested,
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:34:59.360] we're
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:34:59.420] going
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:34:59.460] to
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:34:59.580] have
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:34:59.660] a
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:34:59.780] little
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.180] break.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:01.980] And
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:02.200] that
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:02.400] break
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:02.540] is
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:02.660] going
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:02.780] to
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.040] last
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:03.500] us
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.380] exactly
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.620] five
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:07.800] minutes.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.160] So
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:15.680] we
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:15.860] will
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.300] return
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:16.800] in
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.080] five
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:17.360] minutes.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.380] I'm
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:18.500] going
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:18.540] to
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:18.700] be
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.260] prompt.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:19.780] I
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:19.980] gave
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.060] you
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:20.160] a
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.280] little
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:20.560] timer
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:20.840] here.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.140] So
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.940] please,
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:25.540] I'm
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:25.640] going
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:25.960] to
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.140] begin
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.420] it
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:27.700] right
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:28.480] when
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:28.680] this
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:28.780] is
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:28.960] over.
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:35.620] OK,
[00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.850] almost
[00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:38.610] ready.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.000] I
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.140] hope
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:53.300] you're
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:53.460] all
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:53.940] refreshed
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.920] and
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.160] ready
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:55.340] for
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:55.500] the
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:55.700] second
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.040] half.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:57.900] So
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.140] now
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:58.580] that
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:58.720] we
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:58.860] have
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.620] nondeterminism,
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:00.960] we're
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.040] going
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:01.120] to
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:01.440] use
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.460] that
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:02.660] as
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:02.820] a
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.060] tool
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:03.300] to
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:03.700] prove
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.300] the
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:04.900] closure
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.380] properties
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:05.960] that
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.100] we
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.300] were
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:06.480] aiming
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.300] for
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.580] starting
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:08.800] from
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.040] last
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.400] lecture.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:10.540] OK,
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.060] so
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:12.460] remember,
[00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.410] let's
[00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:15.590] look
[00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:15.710] at
[00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.990] closure
[00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.250] under
[00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.390] a
[00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.610] union.
[00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:17.410] Now,
[00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:17.490] we
[00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:17.650] already
[00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:17.870] did
[00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:18.230] that.
[00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.950] But
[00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:19.230] I'm
[00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.310] going
[00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.330] to
[00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:19.450] do
[00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:19.550] it
[00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.850] again,
[00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:20.590] but
[00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:20.850] this
[00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:21.050] time
[00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.330] using
[00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.130] nondeterminism.
[00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:22.550] And
[00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.890] you'll
[00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:23.350] see
[00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:23.770] how
[00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:24.330] powerful
[00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.770] nondeterminism
[00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:28.010] is
[00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.610] because
[00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:29.450] it's
[00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.630] going
[00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.810] to
[00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:30.070] allow
[00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:30.370] us
[00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:30.530] to
[00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.690] do
[00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:31.050] it
[00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:31.370] kind
[00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.710] of
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.080] almost
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:33.860] with
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.080] no
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:34.340] effort.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.040] We'll
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:37.300] start
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:37.440] off
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:37.560] the
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:37.660] way
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:37.800] we
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:37.920] did
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.300] before.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:39.780] I'm
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:39.840] going
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:39.920] to
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.120] start
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:40.240] off
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:40.360] with
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.680] two
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.780] DFAs.
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:44.520] But
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:44.800] actually,
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.040] these
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.300] could
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.400] be
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:46.960] NFAs
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.260] even.
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:48.740] But
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:49.020] let's
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:49.160] say
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:49.340] we
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:49.640] start
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:49.740] off
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:49.860] with
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.040] the
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:50.260] two
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:50.840] DFAs
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.040] for
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.180] the
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:51.480] two
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.040] languages,
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:52.360] A1
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:52.480] and
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:52.820] A2.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:53.360] And
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:53.520] we're
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:53.620] going
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:53.720] to
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.180] construct
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.360] the
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:54.780] NFA.
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.620] Now
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:55.780] we're
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:55.860] going
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:55.940] to
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.200] construct
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:56.420] an
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.080] NFA
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.720] recognizing
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.020] the
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:36:59.260] union.
[00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:00.440] And
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.180] that's
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:01.340] good
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:01.620] enough
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:01.920] because
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.140] we
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:02.320] already
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:02.600] know
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:02.780] that
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:02.920] we
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.120] can
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.500] convert
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:03.920] NFAs
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.100] to
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:04.560] DFAs.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:05.320] And
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:05.580] therefore,
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:05.900] they
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.540] do
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:06.860] regular
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.520] languages
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:07.840] too.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.020] OK,
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:11.640] so
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.140] now
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:12.380] here
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:12.480] are
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:12.600] the
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:12.940] two
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.100] DFAs
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.600] that
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:14.760] do
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:14.920] the
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.300] languages
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:15.800] A1
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:15.960] and
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.360] A2.
[00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:17.670] And
[00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.830] what
[00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:17.970] I'm
[00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:18.050] going
[00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.150] to
[00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.450] do
[00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:18.790] is
[00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:19.030] I'm
[00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.110] going
[00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:19.270] to
[00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.930] put
[00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:20.090] them
[00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:20.530] together
[00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:21.230] into
[00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.450] a
[00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:21.790] bag
[00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:22.430] of
[00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.830] states,
[00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:24.210] which
[00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:24.330] is
[00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:24.430] going
[00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:24.490] to
[00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:24.630] be
[00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.950] M,
[00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:26.330] the
[00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:27.910] NFA
[00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:28.770] that's
[00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:28.930] going
[00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:29.030] to
[00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.290] do
[00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:29.490] the
[00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:29.810] union
[00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:30.330] language.
[00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:31.050] So
[00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:31.350] remember,
[00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:32.390] what
[00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.630] is
[00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.350] M
[00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:33.670] supposed
[00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.890] to
[00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:34.110] do?
[00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.470] M
[00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.610] is
[00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:34.850] supposed
[00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:35.070] to
[00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:35.610] accept
[00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.290] its
[00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.750] input
[00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:37.190] if
[00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.510] either
[00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.970] M1
[00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:38.370] or
[00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:38.750] M2
[00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:39.130] accept.
[00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:39.970] So
[00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:40.110] how
[00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:40.230] is
[00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.290] it
[00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:40.390] going
[00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.450] to
[00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:40.590] do
[00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:40.850] that?
[00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.530] What
[00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:41.650] it's
[00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:41.770] going
[00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:41.850] to
[00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:42.050] do,
[00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:42.290] we're
[00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.390] going
[00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.470] to
[00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.650] add
[00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.810] a

[00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.450] state
[00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:44.170] to
[00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:44.450] M,
[00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:45.470] which
[00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.610] is
[00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:45.770] going
[00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:45.970] to
[00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:46.310] branch
[00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.590] under
[00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.070] epsilon
[00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:47.670] transitions.
[00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:47.950] And
[00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:48.090] now
[00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:48.170] you
[00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.290] can
[00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.510] start
[00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.670] to
[00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.870] see
[00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:49.110] how
[00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:49.490] useful
[00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.770] these
[00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:50.090] epsilon
[00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:50.630] transitions
[00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.990] are
[00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.070] going
[00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:51.130] to
[00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:51.250] be
[00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:51.410] for
[00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.650] us.
[00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.210] Going
[00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:52.330] to
[00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:52.590] branch
[00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:52.870] under
[00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:53.330] epsilon
[00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.050] transitions
[00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:54.830] to
[00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:54.970] the
[00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:55.150] two
[00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.730] original
[00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.110] start
[00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:56.430] states
[00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.590] of
[00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:56.830] M1
[00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:56.950] and
[00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:57.270] M2.
[00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.970] And
[00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:58.190] we're
[00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.430] done.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:37:59.740] Why?
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:01.920] Well,
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:02.320] now,
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:02.880] non

[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.020] as
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:04.180] we
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:04.380] get
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:04.520] an
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:04.920] input,
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:05.700] w
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.160] coming
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:06.520] in

[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:09.520] at

[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:10.840] just
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:11.140] right
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.340] after
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:11.560] it
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:11.740] gets
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.100] going,
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:12.340] the

[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:12.780] first
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:12.920] thing
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.060] that
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:13.440] happens
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:13.980] is
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.160] it's
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:14.260] going
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:14.380] to

[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:15.500] and
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:15.860] also

[00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:49.300] And
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:49.440] so
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:49.700] M
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.020] is
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:50.120] going

[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.420] And

[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:01.920] state,
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:03.400] then
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.880] M
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.600] is
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:06.800] going
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:06.960] to
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.380] accept
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:07.800] as

[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.520] automaton,
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:09.840] because
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.180] that's
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:10.320] how
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:10.540] non
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:10.980]-determinism
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.380] works.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:11.780] You
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:12.240] accept
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:12.420] if
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.640] any

[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:13.980] of

[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:14.800] ended
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:14.960] up
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.320] accepting,
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:15.680] which
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:15.800] is
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:15.980] just
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:16.140] what
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:16.260] you
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:16.600] need
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:16.760] for
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.100] union.
[00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.690] So
[00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:19.970] we're
[00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:20.150] doing
[00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.370] union.
[00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.550] We
[00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.630] want
[00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.930] either
[00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:21.150] one
[00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.270] of

[00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:21.590] to
[00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:21.870] be
[00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:22.350] accepting.
[00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:22.570] And
[00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:23.550] the
[00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.750] non
[00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:24.310]-determinism
[00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.730] just
[00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:24.950] is
[00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:25.750] built
[00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:26.630] conveniently
[00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.050] to
[00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.290] allow
[00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.490] us
[00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:27.590] to
[00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:27.690] do
[00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:27.850] the

[00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.690] almost

[00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:30.270] free.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:32.760] So
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:32.960] you
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.120] can,
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:33.380] again,
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.040] thinking
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.340] about

[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:38.560] you
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:38.680] could
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:38.880] think
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.020] of

[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.220] And

[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.200] Or
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:50.700] you
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:50.840] can
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.040] think
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:51.320] about

[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:11.540]-determinism
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:11.840] is
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.180] that
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:12.320] it
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.760] always
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.140] guesses
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:13.540] right.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:14.340] So
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:14.540] that
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:14.920] input
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.320] happens
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:15.480] to
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:15.620] be
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.240] an
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.480] input
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:16.780] that's
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:16.900] going
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:16.960] to
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.100] be
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:18.400] accepted
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:18.760] by
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.200] M2.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:20.060] M
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:20.440] is
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:20.580] going
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:20.680] to
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:20.980] guess
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.380] that
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.600] M2
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:22.780] is
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:22.900] the
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.040] right
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.160] way
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:23.300] to
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:23.560] follow,
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:23.780] and
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:23.940] it's
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:24.040] going
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.120] to
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:24.280] go
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:24.760] in
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:24.880] the
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.120] M2
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:25.540] direction.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.280] Because
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:27.760] non
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.360]-determinism,
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:28.940] the
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:29.200] magic
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:29.580] is,
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:29.920] you
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.140] always
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:30.340] guess
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:30.600] right.
[00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.910] Wish
[00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:32.030] that
[00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.170] was
[00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:32.350] true
[00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:32.490] in
[00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:32.670] real
[00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.910] life.
[00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:34.690] Would
[00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:34.870] make
[00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:35.170] exams
[00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:35.330] a
[00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:35.450] lot
[00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.730] easier.
[00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:37.530] Anyway,
[00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:38.270] so
[00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:39.150] now
[00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:39.410] let's
[00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.530] see
[00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.670] how
[00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.790] we
[00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:39.930] can
[00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:40.190] use
[00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.350] that
[00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:40.490] to
[00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:40.630] do
[00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.930] closure
[00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:41.190] under
[00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.970] concatenation.
[00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.710] So
[00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:45.090] now
[00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:45.990] we're
[00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.070] going
[00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:46.210] to
[00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:46.590] actually
[00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:46.850] have
[00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:46.970] a
[00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:47.210] picture
[00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.590] very
[00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:47.930] similar
[00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:48.150] to
[00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.310] the
[00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:48.470] one
[00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.610] we
[00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:48.750] had
[00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:49.130] originally.
[00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:49.450] But
[00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:49.970] now
[00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:50.250] using
[00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:50.470] non
[00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.990]-determinism,
[00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.170] we
[00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.290] can
[00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.470] make
[00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.550] it
[00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.810] work.
[00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:53.230] So
[00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.450] here
[00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.590] we
[00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:53.830] have
[00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:54.010] the
[00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:54.290] two
[00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.830] machines
[00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:55.150] doing
[00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.350] the
[00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:55.730] two
[00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:56.570] languages,
[00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:57.070] A1
[00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:57.210] and
[00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:57.630] A2.
[00:40:58.850 --> 00:40:59.410] And
[00:40:59.410 --> 00:40:59.830] we're
[00:40:59.830 --> 00:40:59.930] going
[00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:00.030] to
[00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.350] combine
[00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:00.550] them
[00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.730] into
[00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:01.150] one
[00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.630] bigger
[00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.030] machine,
[00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.430] M,
[00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:03.970] as
[00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:04.210] shown.
[00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:06.350] Remember,
[00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:06.790] what
[00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.990] M
[00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.090] is
[00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:07.310] supposed
[00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.570] to
[00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:07.870] do
[00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:08.150] is
[00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.470] accept
[00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.670] its
[00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:09.130] input
[00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:09.670] if
[00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.890] there's
[00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:10.070] some
[00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:10.210] way
[00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:10.350] of
[00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:10.670] splitting
[00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.990] that
[00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.330] input
[00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:11.950] such
[00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:12.190] that
[00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.390] the
[00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.650] first
[00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.970] half
[00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:13.150] is
[00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.490] accepted
[00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.710] by
[00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:14.630] M1
[00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.910] and
[00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:15.090] the
[00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:15.330] second
[00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:15.830] part
[00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:16.030] is
[00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.350] accepted
[00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:16.570] by
[00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:16.950] M2.
[00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:19.210] Way
[00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:19.430] we're
[00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.530] going
[00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:19.590] to
[00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:19.750] get
[00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.910] that
[00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:20.390] effect
[00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.170] is
[00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.730] by
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.520] putting
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.860] in
[00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.650] empty
[00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.490] transitions,
[00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.950] epsilon
[00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:32.010] transitions,
[00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.770] going
[00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:33.030] from
[00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.230] the
[00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.430] accept
[00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.890] states
[00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:35.050] of
[00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:35.350] M1
[00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:35.650] to
[00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:35.830] the
[00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:36.030] start
[00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.290] state
[00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:36.410] of
[00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.930] M2,
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:38.900] just
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:39.040] as
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.200] I've
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:39.360] shown
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:39.520] here
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:39.600] in
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:39.740] this
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.040] diagram.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:40.600] So
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:40.820] these
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:40.960] were
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.120] the
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:41.720] original
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.640] accepting
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.020] states
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:43.160] of
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:43.540] M1.
[00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:44.610] And
[00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:45.030] now
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.920] they're
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.000] going
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.080] to
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:47.240] be
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.060] declassified
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:48.300] as
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:48.680] accepting
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.160] states.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.640] But
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.360] they're
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:50.520] going
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:50.680] to
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.060] have
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:51.560] new
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.220] transitions,
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:52.840] empty
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:53.600] transitions,
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.460] attached
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:55.620] to
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:55.840] them,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:56.220] which
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:56.500] allow
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:56.720] them
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:56.940] to
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:57.420] branch
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.120] to
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:58.920] M2
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.460] without
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:41:59.780] reading
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.020] any
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:00.280] input.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:03.580] And
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:03.740] so
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.200] intuitively
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:04.700] speaking,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.000] this
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.180] is
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:05.340] going
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:05.440] to
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:05.580] do
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:05.740] the
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:05.900] right
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.280] thing.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.660] Because
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:08.320] once
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:08.840] M1
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.180] has
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:09.740] accepted
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.360] some
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.160] part
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:12.380] of
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:12.780] W,
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:13.900] then
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.020] you
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:14.800] can
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.680] non
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.480]-deterministically
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:18.820] branch
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.500] to
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.600] M2,
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:22.700] and
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.080] you're
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:25.380] going
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:25.460] to
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:25.760] start
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.220] processing
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:26.760] inside
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.240] M2.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:28.740] And
[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.300] the
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:29.900] point
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.160] is,
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:30.320] as

[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:32.200] of
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:32.580] myself,
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:33.500] is
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:33.760] that
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.280] the
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:34.500] reason
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:34.820] why
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:34.980] it
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:35.200] fixes
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:35.400] the
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:35.600] problem
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:35.720] we
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:35.900] had
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.340] before
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.300] is
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:37.640] that
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.040] the
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.440] epsilon
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.140] transitions,
[00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:40.630] the
[00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:41.070] machine
[00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:41.310] does
[00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:41.570] not
[00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:41.790] have
[00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:41.910] to
[00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:42.130] take
[00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:42.330] them.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:43.550] It
[00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:44.070] can
[00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.410] stay
[00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.930] where
[00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:46.050] it
[00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:46.410] is
[00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:47.470] as
[00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.710] one
[00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.930] non
[00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:48.390]-deterministic
[00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.810] option,
[00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:49.450] or
[00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:49.670] it
[00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.810] can
[00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:49.990] move
[00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.230] along
[00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.410] the
[00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:50.690] epsilon
[00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:51.230] transition
[00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.550] without
[00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:51.890] reading
[00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:52.110] any
[00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:52.450] input
[00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:52.910] as

[00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:54.470] option.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:56.700] So
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:56.840] it's
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.060] using
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:57.240] this
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:57.460] non
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.000]-determinism
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.240] now
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:58.420] to
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.080] both
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:42:59.840] stay
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.020] in
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:00.480] M1
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.180] to
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:01.580] continue
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.020] reading
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:02.420] more
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:02.540] of
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:02.640] the
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:02.940] input
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:03.640] and
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.180] to
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:04.420] jump
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:04.660] into
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:05.280] M2
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:05.960] to
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.200] start
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:06.700] processing
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.380] what
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:07.720] might
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.020] be
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:08.440] the
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:08.700] second
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:09.200] half
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:09.640] or
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:09.800] the
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.020] second
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.480] part
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.000] of
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.140] the
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:11.420] input
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:11.880] which
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.220] M2
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:12.640] accepts.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.340] And
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.220] you
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:14.360] can
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:14.600] think
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:14.700] of
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:14.840] it
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.040] in
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.240] terms
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:15.380] of
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:15.520] the
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:15.840] guessing
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.420] is
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:16.580] that
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:16.720] the
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.020] machine
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:17.280] is
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:17.720] guessing
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.080] where
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.240] to
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:18.420] make
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:18.660] that
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.020] split.
[00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:21.630] Once
[00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.770] it
[00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:22.210] found
[00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:22.790] an
[00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:23.050] initial
[00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:23.550] part
[00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.030] that's
[00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.330] accepted
[00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:24.610] by
[00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:25.050] M1,
[00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.470] it
[00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.790] guesses
[00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:26.310] that
[00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:26.510] this
[00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:26.610] is
[00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:26.730] the
[00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:26.930] right
[00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:27.210] split
[00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:27.610] point,
[00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:28.130] and
[00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.330] that
[00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:28.690] passes
[00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:28.870] to
[00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:29.290] M2.
[00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.830] But
[00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:29.990] there
[00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.130] might
[00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:30.290] be
[00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.550] other
[00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.910] guesses
[00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:31.730] that
[00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:31.830] it
[00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:31.950] could
[00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:32.450] make
[00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:33.810] corresponding
[00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:34.130] to
[00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.370] other
[00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:35.070] possibilities.
[00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:37.270] And
[00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.610] so
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.560] with
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:39.760] non
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.280]-determinism,
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:40.480] it
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:40.800] always
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.120] guesses
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.440] right.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:41.760] If
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.120] there
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:42.320] is
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:42.660] some
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:42.960] way
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.400] to
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:43.680] split
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:43.880] the
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.220] string
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:44.500] into
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:44.720] two
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.180] parts
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:46.620] accepted
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:46.860] by
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.080] M1
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:47.200] and
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:47.560] M2,
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:48.220] the
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:48.580] machine
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.100] will
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:49.400] make
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:49.660] that
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:49.920] good
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.320] guess.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.300] And
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.080] then
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.580] M1
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:53.780] will
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.080] accept
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:54.260] the
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:54.460] first
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:54.820] part,
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:55.300] and
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:55.560] M2
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:55.720] will
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.020] accept
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:56.200] the
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:56.880] second
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.280] part.
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:57.700] And
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:57.860] we'll
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.100] get
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:58.360] M
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:58.800] accepting
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.160] that
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:43:59.540] whole
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.320] string
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.160] altogether.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:01.920] And
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.040] so
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:02.300] that
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:02.960] is
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.500] the
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.140] solution
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.200] to
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:05.700] our
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.600] puzzle
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:06.880] for
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.060] how
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:07.160] do
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:07.260] we
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:07.500] do
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.080] closure
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:08.480] under
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.220] concatenation.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:09.980] I
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:10.860] hope
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:11.080] that
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:11.400] came
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:11.580] through,
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:11.860] because
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.120] this
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.940] is
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.300] just
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:15.820] getting
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:16.080] going
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:16.260] with
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:16.440] non
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:16.920]-determinism.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:17.180] We're
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:17.280] going
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:17.320] to
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:17.420] be
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:17.660] using
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:17.880] non
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.400]-determinism
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:18.800] a
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.080] lot.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:19.280] And
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:19.700] you're
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:19.780] going
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:20.720] to
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:20.880] need
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.000] to
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:21.180] get
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:21.860] very
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.180] comfortable
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:22.440] with
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:22.760] it.
[00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:26.290] Now,
[00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:26.530] let's
[00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:26.730] do
[00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:27.010] closure
[00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:27.230] under
[00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.530] star.
[00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:29.770] And
[00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:30.030] closure
[00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.250] under
[00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:30.710] star
[00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:31.810] works
[00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:32.630] very
[00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:33.070] similarly.
[00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:34.250] But
[00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.410] now
[00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:34.550] we're
[00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.670] just
[00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.810] going
[00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:34.890] to
[00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:35.170] have
[00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:35.470] a
[00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.710] single
[00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:36.030] language.
[00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.290] If
[00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:36.450] A
[00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:36.630] is
[00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.950] regular,
[00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:37.270] so
[00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.450] is
[00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:37.610] A
[00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:37.850] star.
[00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:38.170] So
[00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:38.350] they're
[00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:38.530] not
[00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:38.670] a
[00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.830] pair
[00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:38.990] of
[00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.290] languages
[00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.550] because
[00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:40.210] star
[00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:40.570] is
[00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:41.310] a
[00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:41.670] unary
[00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:42.490] operation
[00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:43.750] applying
[00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.930] to
[00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:44.110] just
[00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:44.290] a
[00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:44.690] single
[00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.410] language.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:47.800] So
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:47.900] if
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:48.000] we
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:48.160] have
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:48.400] a
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:48.760] DFA
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.420] recognizing
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:49.840] A,
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.420] in
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:50.580] order
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:50.820] to
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.180] show
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:51.820] that
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:52.180] A
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:52.420] star
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:52.660] is
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.020] regular,
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:53.580] we
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:53.740] have
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:53.880] to
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:54.360] construct
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:54.960] a
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.320] machine
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:55.560] that
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.040] recognizes
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:56.300] A
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:56.600] star.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.000] And
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.340] the
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:57.540] machine
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:57.680] we're
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:57.780] going
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:57.840] to
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.220] construct
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:58.520] is,
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:58.640] as
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.060] before,
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:44:59.880] an
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:00.520] NFA.
[00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:03.030] So
[00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.770] here
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:05.860] is
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.300] M,
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:07.780] the
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:08.180] DFA
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:08.440] for
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:08.820] A.
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:09.840] And
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:09.980] we're
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:10.020] going
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:10.180] to
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:10.640] build
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.140] an

[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:11.960] M
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.420] prime,
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:13.220] that
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:13.740] recognizes
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:14.080] A
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:14.280] star.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:15.940] And
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:16.240] let's
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:16.520] think
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:16.820] now,
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:17.280] what
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:17.420] does
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:17.580] it
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.020] mean
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:18.460] to
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:18.920] recognize
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.520] A
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:19.860] star?
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:21.680] So
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:21.900] when
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:22.100] should
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:22.380] M
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:22.500] prime?
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:22.920] If
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.080] I'm
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:23.180] going
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:23.280] to
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:23.460] give
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:23.580] you
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:23.720] an
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.020] input,
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:24.860] when
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:25.020] is

[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.280] language?
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:26.880] What
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.060] does
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:27.360] M
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:27.720] prime
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.040] have

[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:28.400] do?
[00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:30.390] So
[00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.670] M
[00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.890] prime,
[00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.250] remember
[00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.490] what
[00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.770] star
[00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.030] is.
[00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.530] Star
[00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:32.930] means
[00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:33.310] you
[00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:33.430] can
[00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.650] take

[00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.230] in

[00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:38.190] language.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:38.860] So
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.100] to
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:39.660] determine
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:40.180] if

[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:41.860] you
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.060] have

[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:42.520] see,
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:43.020] can

[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.560] So
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:53.300] you
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:53.620] want
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:53.740] to

[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:56.700] and
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:57.020] cut
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:57.160] it
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:57.340] up
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:57.560] into
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:57.740] a
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:57.900] bunch
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:58.040] of
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:58.340] pieces,
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:58.780] four
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:45:59.000] in
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:45:59.180] this
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:45:59.520] case,
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:00.880] where
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.140] each
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:01.240] of
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:01.460] those
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:01.860] pieces
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:02.380] are
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:02.920] members
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.300] of
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:03.680] A.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.160] They're
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:04.420] members
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:04.620] of
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:04.760] the
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.100] original
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:05.540] language.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:06.080] So
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:06.780] that's
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:06.880] what
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.080] M
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:07.480] prime's
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:07.780] job
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.140] is.
[00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.850] It
[00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:10.310] has
[00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:10.510] its
[00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.910] input
[00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:11.450] and
[00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.690] wants
[00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.810] to
[00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:12.010] know,
[00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:12.430] can
[00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.570] I
[00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:12.830] cut
[00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:12.990] that
[00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.310] input
[00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:13.630] up
[00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.810] into
[00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:14.230] pieces,
[00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.810] each
[00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:14.990] of
[00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.170] which
[00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.370] are
[00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:15.890] accepted
[00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:16.130] by
[00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.330] the
[00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:16.670] original
[00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:17.050] machine?
[00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:19.430] That's
[00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.550] what
[00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.690] M
[00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:19.830] prime
[00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:20.130] does.
[00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.650] And
[00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:21.810] if
[00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:21.910] you
[00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:22.130] think
[00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.410] about
[00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:23.110] it
[00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:24.150] a
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.060] little
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:26.340] bit,
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:27.180] really
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:27.500] what's
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:27.820] happening
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:28.080] is
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.260] that
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:28.500] as
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:28.900] soon
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:29.320] as
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.400] M,
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:31.180] so
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:31.760] M
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.060] prime
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:32.260] is
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:32.360] going
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:32.400] to
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:32.540] be
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:33.080] simulating
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:33.300] M.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:33.520] That's
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:33.600] why
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:33.680] I
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:33.820] like
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:33.940] to
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.080] think
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:34.320] about
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:34.540] this
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:34.700] as
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:34.940] having
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:35.140] M
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:35.480] inside.
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:36.240] So
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.200] if
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:37.380] you
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:37.520] were
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:37.700] going
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:37.800] to
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:37.940] be
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.120] doing
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:38.300] this
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:38.660] yourself,
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:39.280] you're
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:39.380] going
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:39.580] to
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:40.040] take
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:40.360] w,
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:40.740] you're
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:40.800] going
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:40.860] to
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.160] run
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:41.260] it
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:41.400] for
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:41.500] a
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:41.660] while,
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:41.900] you'll
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:42.120] see,
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:42.440] oh,
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:42.680] M
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:42.820] is
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:43.220] accepted.
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:44.220] Now
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:44.320] I
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:44.440] have
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:44.540] to
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:44.820] start
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:44.980] M
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:45.280] over
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:45.640] again
[00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:47.070] to
[00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:47.190] see
[00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.290] if
[00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:47.370] it
[00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:47.750] accepts
[00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.030] the
[00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.270] next
[00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.550] segment.
[00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:50.890] So
[00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:51.190] every
[00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.570] time
[00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:51.770] M
[00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:52.350] accepts,
[00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:53.130] you're
[00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:53.150] going
[00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.270] to
[00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.690] restart
[00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:54.050] M
[00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.550] to
[00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.690] see
[00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:54.810] if
[00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:54.910] it
[00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:55.170] accepts
[00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:55.750] another
[00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:56.230] segment.
[00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.530] And
[00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:56.710] so
[00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.990] by
[00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.310] doing
[00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:57.510] that,
[00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.690] you're
[00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:57.770] going
[00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:57.850] to
[00:46:57.850 --> 00:46:58.030] be
[00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.290] cutting
[00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:58.670] w
[00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.970] up
[00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:59.230] into
[00:46:59.230 --> 00:46:59.550] different
[00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.030] segments,
[00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:01.230] each
[00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.390] of
[00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.530] which
[00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:01.690] is
[00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:02.010] accepted
[00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:02.270] by
[00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.490] M.
[00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.350] Of
[00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:03.610] course,
[00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:04.570] it's
[00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:04.830] never
[00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:05.450] totally
[00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:06.010] clear
[00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:06.830] whether
[00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:07.090] you
[00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:07.490] should,
[00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.550] for
[00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.730] any
[00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:08.970] given
[00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:09.390] segment,
[00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.650] you
[00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.850] should
[00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:10.090] cut
[00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:10.210] it
[00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:10.510] there
[00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.630] or
[00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.790] you
[00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.930] should
[00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:11.150] wait
[00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.290] a
[00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:11.430] little
[00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.810] longer
[00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:12.090] and
[00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:12.290] find
[00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.430] a
[00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:13.450] later
[00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:13.750] place
[00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.930] to
[00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:14.150] cut.
[00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.650] But
[00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:14.910] that's
[00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:15.230] exactly
[00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.470] the
[00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.650] same
[00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:16.010] problem
[00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.210] that
[00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:16.330] we
[00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:16.550] had
[00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.970] before
[00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:17.490] with
[00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.230] concatenation.
[00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:19.850] And
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.400] we
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:20.640] solved
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:20.760] it
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.000] using
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.700] nondeterminism,
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:21.940] and
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:22.100] we're
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:22.180] going
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:22.260] to
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:22.440] solve
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:22.560] it
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:22.760] again
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.020] using
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:23.660] nondeterminism.
[00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:25.490] So
[00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:26.030] the
[00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.150] way
[00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.290] we're
[00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:26.390] going
[00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.450] to
[00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.590] get
[00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:26.750] that
[00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:27.170] effect
[00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.950] of
[00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:28.370] starting
[00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.570] the
[00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:28.850] machine
[00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:29.230] over
[00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.590] again
[00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:30.210] once
[00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:30.830] it's
[00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:31.230] accepted
[00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:32.090] is
[00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:32.530] by
[00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:33.310] adding
[00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:33.830] in
[00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:36.130] epsilon
[00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:36.750] transitions
[00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:37.170] that
[00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:37.310] go
[00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:37.490] from
[00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.670] the
[00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.910] start
[00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:38.350] states
[00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:38.930] back
[00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:39.090] to
[00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:39.230] the,
[00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:39.950] from
[00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:40.350] the
[00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:40.610] accept
[00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:40.870] state
[00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.990] back
[00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.190] to
[00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.330] the
[00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:41.530] start
[00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:41.770] state.
[00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:47.890] So
[00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:48.070] now
[00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:48.370] every
[00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:48.950] time
[00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:49.790] M
[00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:50.230] has
[00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.690] accepted,
[00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:51.210] it
[00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:51.390] has
[00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:51.550] an
[00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:51.910] option,
[00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:52.230] not
[00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.630] a
[00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:53.030] requirement,
[00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:53.370] but
[00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:53.430] it
[00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.570] has
[00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:53.710] an
[00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:54.050] option.
[00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:54.530] It
[00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.650] can
[00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:54.830] either
[00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:55.290] stay
[00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:55.790] continuing
[00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:56.030] to
[00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.410] process
[00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.470] or
[00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.670] it
[00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.790] could
[00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:58.350] restart
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:47:59.940] making
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:00.140] a
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:00.360] cut
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:00.520] at
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:00.700] that
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:01.080] point
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:02.840] and
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.320] trying
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:03.760] to
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.820] see
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:04.960] if
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:05.200] there's
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:05.520] yet
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:05.780] a
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:05.980] different,
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:06.260] a
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:06.460] second,
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:06.860] another
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:07.280] segment
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:07.840] of
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:07.960] the
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:08.200] input
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:08.440] that's
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:08.600] going
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:08.740] to
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:08.840] be,
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:09.360] that
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:09.640] it's
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:09.780] going
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:09.940] to
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.260] accept.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:11.800] And
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.020] this
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:12.160] is
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.500] basically
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:12.740] the
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:12.920] whole
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:13.280] thing.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:13.580] With
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:13.900] one
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:14.460] little
[00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.210] problem
[00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:18.570] that
[00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:18.950] we
[00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:19.530] need
[00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:19.670] to
[00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.830] deal
[00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:20.110] with,
[00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:20.870] and
[00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:21.170] that
[00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.790] is
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.360] we
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:24.680] need
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:25.060] to
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:25.460] make
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:25.980] sure
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.620] that
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:27.860] M
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:28.400] prime
[00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.310] accepts
[00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:30.550] the
[00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:30.730] empty
[00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:31.070] string.
[00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:31.650] Because
[00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:32.150] remember,
[00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:32.610] the
[00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:33.430] empty
[00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.750] string
[00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.990] is
[00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.490] always
[00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:35.050] a
[00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:35.250] member
[00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:35.890] of
[00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:36.530] the
[00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:37.330] starred
[00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:38.230] language.
[00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:40.370] And
[00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.610] as
[00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:41.930] it's
[00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:42.690] written
[00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:43.190] right
[00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.570] now,
[00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:44.810] we're
[00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:45.070] going
[00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:45.330] to
[00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:45.610] be
[00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:46.250] requiring
[00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:46.510] there
[00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.670] to
[00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.810] be
[00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:46.950] at
[00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:47.270] least
[00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.670] one
[00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:48.150] copy
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.880] of,
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:50.520] at
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:50.720] least
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:50.960] one
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.300] segment.
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:51.620] We're
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:51.780] not
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:52.040] taking
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:52.340] into
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:52.660] account
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:52.840] the
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.260] possibility
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:53.500] of
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:53.800] no
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:54.260] segments,
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:54.740] which
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:54.820] is
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:54.960] the
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.160] empty
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:55.480] string.
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:56.700] And
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:56.800] the
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:56.900] way
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:57.020] we're
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:57.120] going
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:57.200] to
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:57.340] get
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:57.780] that
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:58.640] is,
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:58.900] well,
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:48:59.140] I
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:48:59.320] mean,
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.100] one
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:00.440] thing,
[00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:02.470] one
[00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.630] way
[00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.790] to
[00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.990] get
[00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.310] to
[00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:03.630] add,
[00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:04.390] so
[00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.850] we're
[00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:05.070] missing
[00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:05.270] the
[00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.470] empty
[00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.690] string
[00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.930] right
[00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:06.150] now.
[00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:06.710] So
[00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.870] how
[00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.950] do
[00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:07.090] we
[00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:07.310] fix
[00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:07.470] it?
[00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:07.970] Basically,
[00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:08.390] we're
[00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.530] just
[00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:08.670] going
[00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:08.750] to
[00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.930] take
[00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:09.070] the
[00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:09.430] construction
[00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.670] we
[00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.950] have
[00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.910] on
[00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:12.350] the
[00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:12.650] screen,
[00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:13.290] and
[00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:13.430] we're
[00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.510] going
[00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:14.090] to
[00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:15.230] adjust
[00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.390] it
[00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:15.530] to
[00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:16.330] add
[00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:16.610] in
[00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:16.770] the
[00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:16.950] empty
[00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:17.350] string,
[00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.630] because
[00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.850] it's
[00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:18.310] possibly
[00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:18.690] missing.
[00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:19.770] One
[00:49:19.770 --> 00:49:19.930] way
[00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:20.090] to
[00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:20.250] do
[00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:20.630] that,
[00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.610] which
[00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:21.770] is
[00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:22.110] tempting
[00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:22.610] but
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.160] wrong,
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:25.700] is
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:26.120] to
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.180] make
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:28.420] the
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:28.720] start
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.060] state
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:29.260] of
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:29.580] M
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.360] an
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:30.820] accepting
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.360] state
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:31.820] for
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:32.020] M
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:32.260] prime.
[00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:33.190] So
[00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.350] we
[00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:33.470] could
[00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.210] have
[00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:34.370] made
[00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.570] this
[00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:35.390] an
[00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.750] accepting
[00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:36.070] state
[00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:36.290] too.
[00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:37.190] And
[00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.510] now
[00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.830] M
[00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:38.010] prime
[00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:38.210] is
[00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.450] also
[00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.690] going
[00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:38.850] to
[00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:39.130] accept
[00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:39.290] the
[00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.470] empty
[00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.810] string.
[00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:40.450] That's
[00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:40.570] the
[00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:40.730] good
[00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.970] news.
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:42.300] The
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:42.640] problem
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:42.980] is
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:43.620] that
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.560] the
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:47.820] start
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.220] state
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:48.640] might
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:48.920] be
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:49.260] playing
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:49.560] some
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:49.940] other
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:50.480] role
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.120] in
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:51.440] M
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:51.940] besides
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:52.380] just
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:52.600] being
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:52.780] the
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:53.000] start.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:53.220] There
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:53.380] might
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:53.540] be
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:53.800] times
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.040] when
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:54.280] M
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:54.540] comes
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:54.880] back
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:55.040] to
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:55.200] the
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:55.420] start
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:55.820] state
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:57.540] later
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.000] on.
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:49:58.860] And
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:49:58.960] if
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:59.060] we
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:49:59.260] make
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:49:59.400] the
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:49:59.600] start
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:49:59.860] state
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:00.880] an
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.120] accept
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:01.440] state,
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:01.880] it's
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.020] going
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:02.160] to
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:02.980] suddenly
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:03.300] start
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:03.620] accepting
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:03.800] a
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:03.940] bunch
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:04.060] of
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:04.320] other
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:04.580] things
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:04.880] too,
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:05.460] which
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:05.680] might
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:05.840] not
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:06.020] be
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:06.360] intended.
[00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.610] So
[00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:07.770] it's
[00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:07.870] a
[00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:08.050] bad
[00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:08.430] idea
[00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.710] to
[00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.890] make
[00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:09.070] the
[00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:09.350] start
[00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:09.630] state
[00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.810] an
[00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:10.050] accept
[00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:10.330] state.
[00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:11.530] Instead,
[00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.410] we'll
[00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.550] take
[00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:12.730] the
[00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:13.030] simple
[00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.010] alternative
[00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:15.410] of
[00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:16.270] adding
[00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.570] a
[00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:16.870] new
[00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:17.170] start
[00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:17.530] state,
[00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:18.370] which
[00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:18.510] will
[00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:18.950] never
[00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:19.350] be
[00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:19.870] returned
[00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:20.190] to
[00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:20.670] under
[00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:21.090] any
[00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:21.750] circumstances,
[00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:22.390] and
[00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.590] make
[00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:23.110] that
[00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:23.650] a
[00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:23.890] new
[00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:24.550] start
[00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:25.290] and
[00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:25.550] accept
[00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:25.830] state
[00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:26.010] as
[00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:26.190] well.
[00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.770] So
[00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:26.970] here,
[00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.170] we'll
[00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.290] have
[00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:27.370] to
[00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:27.490] make
[00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:27.650] this
[00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.990] additional
[00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.670] modification.
[00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:29.610] So
[00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:29.790] as
[00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:29.950] I'm
[00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:30.230] saying,
[00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.430] this
[00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:30.530] is
[00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.670] what
[00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.770] we
[00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.910] need
[00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:31.050] to
[00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:31.330] do.
[00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:31.810] And
[00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:31.890] the
[00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:31.950] way
[00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:32.110] we'll
[00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:32.270] do
[00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.590] that
[00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:33.250] is
[00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:33.430] by
[00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.670] adding
[00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.830] a
[00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:33.970] new
[00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:34.210] start
[00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:34.510] state,
[00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:34.690] which
[00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:34.830] is
[00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:35.030] also
[00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.190] an
[00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.430] accept
[00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.710] state
[00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.870] to
[00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.990] make
[00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.210] sure
[00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:36.350] it
[00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:36.570] accepts
[00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:36.770] the
[00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.970] empty
[00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:37.310] string.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:38.280] And
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:38.540] then
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:38.900] that
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.280] also
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:39.560] can
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.060] branch
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.200] to
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:42.560] start
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:42.840] off
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.220] M
[00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:44.630] as
[00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:45.130] before
[00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.470] if
[00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.610] the
[00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:46.910] string
[00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:47.170] that's
[00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:47.450] input
[00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:47.670] is
[00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.870] not
[00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:48.010] the
[00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:48.190] empty
[00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.550] string.
[00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.930] And
[00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:49.110] so
[00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:49.310] then
[00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:50.470] M
[00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.870] prime
[00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.990] is
[00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.190] actually
[00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.350] going
[00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:51.410] to
[00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:51.510] have
[00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.610] to
[00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:51.730] do
[00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:51.930] some
[00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:52.230] work
[00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.550] to
[00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:52.670] see
[00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.810] if
[00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:53.010] it
[00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:53.150] can
[00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.310] be
[00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:53.470] cut
[00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.650] up
[00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:53.830] as
[00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:53.950] it
[00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:54.190] was
[00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:55.010] doing
[00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.330] before.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:57.900] So
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:58.380] that's
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.120] the
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:50:59.460] proof
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:50:59.720] of
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.020] closure
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.240] under
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:00.480] star.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:00.640] I'm
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:00.820] not
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:00.920] going
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:01.020] to
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:01.140] do
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:01.240] it
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:01.580] anything
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.000] beyond
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:02.240] what
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:02.400] I've
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:02.540] just
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:02.960] described.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:03.240] These
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:03.540] proofs
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:03.660] by
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:03.940] picture
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:04.240] are
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:04.580] convincing
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:05.000] enough,
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:05.380] I
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:05.700] hope.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.040] And
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.480] if
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:07.740] not,
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:08.160] they
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:08.940] are
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:09.360] explained
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:09.580] in
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:09.820] somewhat
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:10.120] more
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:10.580] detail,
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:10.900] somewhat
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:11.140] more
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:11.380] formally
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:11.580] in
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:11.700] the
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:12.000] textbook.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:12.820] But
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:13.400] for
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:13.540] the
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:13.740] lecture,
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:13.980] this
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:14.100] is
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:14.280] where
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:14.420] I'm
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:14.520] going
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:14.600] to
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:14.880] stop
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.120] with
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:15.540] these
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.100] two
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:16.460] arguments.
[00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.990] And
[00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.170] so
[00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.570] now,
[00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:19.350] oh,
[00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.490] yeah,
[00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:19.790] one
[00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:20.510] quick
[00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.790] check
[00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.890]-in
[00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:21.070] on
[00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:21.370] this.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:24.180] So
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:24.320] if
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:24.540] M
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:24.760] has
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.100] n
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:25.680] states,
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:26.520] how
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:26.700] many
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:27.020] states
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.200] does
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:27.420] M
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:27.660] prime
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:27.960] have
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:28.140] by
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:28.360] this
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:28.800] construction?
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.140] So
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:31.460] let's
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:31.780] do,
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:32.520] really,
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.160] these
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:33.380] are,
[00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:34.430] I'm
[00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.590] not
[00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:34.910] intending
[00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:35.230] these
[00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.370] to
[00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:35.510] be
[00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.750] very
[00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:36.110] hard.
[00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:36.350] More
[00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:37.090] just
[00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:37.250] to
[00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:37.450] keep
[00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:37.630] you
[00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:38.090] awake.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.080] So
[00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:42.590] how
[00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:42.930] many
[00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:43.730] states
[00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:44.250] does
[00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:45.350] M
[00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:45.710] prime
[00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:46.450] have?
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:48.720] OK,
[00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:50.850] maybe
[00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:51.010] a
[00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:51.110] little
[00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:51.290] too
[00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:51.550] easy
[00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:51.750] even
[00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.930] for
[00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:52.070] a
[00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:52.250] check
[00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.350]-in.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:55.320] Yeah,
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:55.860] everybody's
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:56.040] getting
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:56.260] this
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:56.500] one.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:57.960] Because
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.120] all
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:58.260] you
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:51:58.420] did
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:58.660] was
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:51:59.100] we
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:51:59.340] added
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:51:59.600] one
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:51:59.820] new
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.080] state.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:01.320] So
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:01.560] the
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:01.860] answer
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:02.100] is,
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:02.340] as
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:02.580] you
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:03.040] have,
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.260] I
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:04.380] think,
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:04.580] should
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:04.800] pretty
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:04.980] much
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:05.300] everybody
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:05.740] is
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:06.660] observing
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.020] that
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:07.260] it's
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:07.620] just
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:08.160] the,
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.480] it's
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:09.660] number
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:09.860] b.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.080] So
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:11.340] I'm
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:11.420] going
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:11.560] to
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:11.800] end
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:11.960] the
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:12.240] polling.
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.220] I'm
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:13.300] going
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:13.380] to
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:13.540] share
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:13.680] the
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.120] results.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:15.580] And
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:16.100] everybody
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:16.360] got
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:16.580] that
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:16.820] one.
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:17.160] And
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:17.300] so
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:17.580] let's
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:17.940] continue
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:18.380] on.
[00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.990] And
[00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.550] so
[00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:25.070] the
[00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:25.270] very
[00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.630] last
[00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:25.790] thing
[00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.950] we're
[00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:26.050] going
[00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:26.130] to
[00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:26.490] do
[00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:27.090] today
[00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:27.730] is
[00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:28.070] show
[00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:28.270] you
[00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.470] how
[00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.610] to
[00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:29.110] convert
[00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:29.910] regular
[00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:30.490] expressions
[00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:31.650] to
[00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:32.690] NFAs,
[00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:35.130] thereby
[00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:35.610] showing
[00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:35.870] that
[00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:36.290] every
[00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:36.770] language
[00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:37.050] that
[00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:37.190] you
[00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.350] can
[00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:37.790] describe
[00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.950] with
[00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:38.070] a
[00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:38.350] regular
[00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:38.870] expression
[00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:39.090] is
[00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:39.290] a
[00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.570] regular
[00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:40.010] language.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:42.380] On
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:42.700] Tuesday,
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.040] we'll
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:43.200] show
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:43.320] how
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:43.420] to
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:43.520] do
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:43.680] the
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.060] conversion
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:44.260] in
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:44.360] the
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:44.480] other
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.140] direction,
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:46.080] thereby
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:46.580] showing
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:46.840] that
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.120] these
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.040] two
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.280] methods
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:49.500] of
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:49.920] describing
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:50.580] languages
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:50.920] are
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:51.220] equivalent
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:51.420] to
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:51.540] one
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:51.780] another.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:52.580] So
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:52.760] here
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:52.860] is
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:53.060] our
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:53.360] theorem.
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:53.840] If
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.080] R
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.020] is
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:55.200] a
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:55.520] regular
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.100] expression
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:56.740] and
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:56.960] A
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.120] is
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:57.240] the
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:57.640] language,
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:58.080] is
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:58.280] a
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:58.400] set
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:58.520] of
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:58.880] strings
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.120] that
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:52:59.760] regular
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.240] expression
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:00.860] describes,
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:01.560] then
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:01.720] A
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:01.860] is
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:02.100] regular.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.080] So
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:07.680] we're
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:07.900] going
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:08.040] to
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:08.280] show
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:08.460] how
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:08.600] to
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.160] convert.
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:11.840] The
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:12.240] strategy
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:12.480] is
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:12.660] to
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.040] convert
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:13.340] R
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:13.580] to
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:13.720] an
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.280] equivalent
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.180] NFAM.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:17.740] And
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:18.380] so
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:18.540] we
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:18.720] have
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:18.840] to
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:19.020] think
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:19.260] about,
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:19.660] remember,
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:20.020] these
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:20.380] regular
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:20.880] expressions
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.900] that
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:22.040] we
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:22.420] introduced
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:22.740] last
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:23.040] time.
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:23.560] These
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:23.660] are
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:23.860] these
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:24.340] expressions
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:24.660] that
[00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:24.900] look
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.100] like
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.320] AB
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:28.000] union
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:28.460] B
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:28.920] star,
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:29.560] something
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:29.820] like
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:30.100] that.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:31.100] So
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:31.400] built
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:31.560] up
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:31.660] out
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:31.720] of
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:31.840] the
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.080] regular
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:32.660] operations
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:33.400] from
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.800] the
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.200] primitive
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.120] regular
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:37.600] expressions
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:37.860] that
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:38.060] don't
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:38.240] have
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:38.380] any
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:38.880] operations,
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:39.240] that
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:39.560] we're
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:39.800] calling
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.240] atomic.
[00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:41.190] So
[00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.330] if
[00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:41.470] R
[00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.590] is
[00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:41.730] an
[00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:42.030] atomic
[00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.410] regular
[00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:42.850] expression,
[00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:43.030] it
[00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.210] just
[00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:43.430] looks
[00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:44.150] like
[00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.710] either
[00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.970] just
[00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:45.110] a
[00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:45.310] single
[00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:45.750] symbol,
[00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.270] or
[00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.390] an
[00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.630] empty
[00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.970] string
[00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:47.430] symbol,
[00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:48.170] or
[00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:49.190] an
[00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.430] empty
[00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:50.010] language
[00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:50.630] symbol.
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:54.620] Or
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.300] R
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:55.720] can
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.300] be
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:56.960] a
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.420] composite
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:57.960] regular
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:58.460] expression.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:01.280] Whoops,
[00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:02.730] we're
[00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:02.970] having
[00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:03.150] a
[00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.330] little.
[00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:06.270] Yeah,
[00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.570] so
[00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:07.550] we
[00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:07.690] have
[00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:07.870] two
[00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:08.410] possibilities
[00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:08.850] here.
[00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:09.710] R
[00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.850] is
[00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:10.030] either
[00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.370] atomic
[00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.590] or
[00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:11.030] composite.
[00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.910] And
[00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:12.190] so
[00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.830] let's
[00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:13.010] look
[00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.110] at
[00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:13.230] what
[00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.410] the
[00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:13.930] equivalent
[00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:14.970] expression
[00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:15.450] is
[00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:16.470] in
[00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.610] each
[00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:16.950] case.
[00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:18.050] So
[00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:18.210] if
[00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:18.490] R
[00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:18.730] is
[00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:19.370] just
[00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:19.910] the
[00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:20.410] single
[00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:20.790] letter
[00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:21.210] regular
[00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:21.770] expression,
[00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:22.070] that's
[00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:22.130] a
[00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:22.650] totally
[00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:23.390] legitimate
[00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.730] regular
[00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:24.130] expression,
[00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.450] just
[00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:24.570] a
[00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:24.790] regular
[00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:25.230] expression
[00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:26.250] 1.
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:27.240] So
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:27.400] that
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:27.580] just
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:28.060] describes
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:28.300] the
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:28.640] language
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:29.580] of
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:29.820] the
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.120] string
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:30.520] 1.
[00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:31.390] So
[00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.730] we
[00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.930] have
[00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:32.050] to
[00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:32.310] make
[00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.110] an
[00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:33.750] NFA
[00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:34.430] which
[00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.930] accepts,
[00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.410] which
[00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:35.990] recognizes
[00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.350] just
[00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:36.550] that
[00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:36.870] language.
[00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:37.050] It
[00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:37.290] accepts
[00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:37.630] only
[00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:37.830] the
[00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:38.010] string
[00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:38.270] 1.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:39.920] So
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:40.280] it's
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:40.360] a
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:40.480] very
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:40.820] simple
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:41.340] NFA.
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:42.040] It
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:42.240] just
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:42.640] starts
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:43.200] in
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:43.340] the
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:43.560] start
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:43.900] state.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:44.600] And
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:44.900] on
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:45.140] that
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:45.700] single
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.140] symbol,
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:46.640] it
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.020] branches
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:47.820] to
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:48.400] an
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:48.660] accept
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.060] state.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:49.720] And
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:49.840] there
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:49.940] were
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:50.080] no
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:50.280] other
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:50.740] transitions
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:51.120] allowed.
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:51.960] So
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.100] if
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:52.160] you
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:52.320] get
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:52.660] anything
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:52.960] else
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:53.220] coming
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:53.580] in
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:54.120] besides
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:54.480] that
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.960] string,
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:56.300] which
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:56.460] is
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:56.660] just
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:56.860] that
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:57.100] one
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:57.460] symbol,
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:58.300] the
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:58.800] NFA
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:54:58.980] is
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:54:59.140] going
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:54:59.300] to
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:54:59.580] reject
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:54:59.800] it.
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:00.680] Like
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:00.800] if
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:00.880] it
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:01.100] goes,
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:01.360] if
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:01.500] it's
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:01.660] too
[00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:01.880] long,
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:02.580] if
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.200] it
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:03.500] gets
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:03.920] AA
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:04.440] coming
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:04.740] in,
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:05.100] well,
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:05.280] there's
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:05.480] nowhere
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:05.700] to
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:06.480] go
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.140] from
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:07.540] this
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.960] accepting
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.280] state
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:09.480] on
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:09.620] an

[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:10.160] so
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:10.300] the
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:10.480] machine
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:10.620] is
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:10.760] just
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:10.920] going
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.060] to
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:11.280] die.
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.080] It
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:12.240] has
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:12.340] to
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:12.460] be
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:12.560] in
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:12.680] an

[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:13.360] at
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:13.520] the

[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:13.840] of
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:13.940] the

[00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.730] How
[00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:17.910] about,
[00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:18.470] why
[00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.570] don't
[00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:18.610] you
[00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:18.830] think
[00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:18.950] for
[00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:19.210] yourself
[00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:19.410] for
[00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:19.550] a
[00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:19.670] minute,
[00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.930] how
[00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:20.010] do
[00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:20.150] we
[00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.470] make
[00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.990] an
[00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.550] NFA
[00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:22.010] which
[00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:23.330] accepts
[00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:23.830] only
[00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:24.090] the
[00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:24.290] empty
[00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:24.690] string
[00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:24.850] and
[00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:24.990] no
[00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:25.170] other
[00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:25.510] strings?
[00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:26.450] You
[00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:26.550] can
[00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:26.630] do
[00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.750] that
[00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.890] with
[00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:27.030] just
[00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.210] one
[00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:27.550] state
[00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:27.830] with
[00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:27.950] an
[00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:28.410] NFA,
[00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:29.430] just
[00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.610] this
[00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:29.770] one
[00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:29.950] here.
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:31.980] The
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:32.260] machine
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:32.400] is
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:32.500] going
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:32.600] to
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:32.860] start
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:32.960] off
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.060] in
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:33.180] the
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:33.400] start
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:33.620] state,
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:33.820] which
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:33.940] is
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:34.160] also
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:34.560] immediately
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:34.760] an
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:34.960] accept
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.280] state,
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:35.460] so
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:35.560] it
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:35.840] accepts
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.000] the
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:36.160] empty
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:36.500] string.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:37.520] But
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:37.660] if
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:38.100] anything
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:38.340] else
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:38.540] comes
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:38.720] in,
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:38.900] there's
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:39.080] nowhere
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:39.260] to
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:39.420] go
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:39.520] when
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:39.640] the
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:39.820] machine
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:40.080] dies.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:41.980] So
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:42.200] this
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:42.520] machine
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:42.940] accepts
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:43.740] just
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:43.900] the
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:44.080] empty
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:44.420] string,
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:44.820] or
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.040] its
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:45.640] language
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:45.880] is
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.040] the
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:46.320] language
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:46.540] with
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:46.780] one
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:47.060] element,
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:47.300] the
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:47.480] empty
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:47.740] string.
[00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:49.270] How
[00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.410] about
[00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:49.570] the
[00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:49.790] empty
[00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:50.170] language?
[00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.370] Well,
[00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:52.170] here's
[00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:52.390] an
[00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.830] NFA
[00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:53.290] which
[00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:54.110] has
[00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:54.310] no
[00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:54.710] accepting
[00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:55.010] state,
[00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:55.170] so
[00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:55.270] it
[00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.430] can't
[00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.530] be
[00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:55.830] accepting
[00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:56.170] anything.
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:55:59.100] Now,
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:55:59.400] if
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:55:59.600] we
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:55:59.740] have
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:55:59.880] a
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.460] composite
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:01.220] regular
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:01.760] expression,
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:03.690] we're
[00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:03.870] already
[00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:04.290] finished,
[00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:05.050] because
[00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:05.250] we
[00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:05.710] showed
[00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:05.970] how
[00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:06.170] to
[00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.550] build
[00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:07.030] up.
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:07.960] We
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.260] showed
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:09.320] constructions
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.000] which
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.020] give
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:11.220] us
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:11.680] closure
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:12.040] under
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:12.520] union,
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.180] concatenation,
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:14.340] and
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:14.620] star.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.280] And
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:15.660] those
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:16.460] constructions
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:16.600] are
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:16.760] going
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:16.960] to
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.260] enable
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:17.620] us
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:18.020] to
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:18.300] build
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:18.820] up
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:19.780] the
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.540] NFAs
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.500] that
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:22.960] do
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.220] the
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:24.680] language
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:25.000] of
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:25.160] these
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:25.400] more
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.120] complex
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.100] regular
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:28.700] expressions
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:29.260] built
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:29.820] up
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:30.540] out
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:30.940] of
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:32.240] the
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:32.700] NFAs
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:33.020] that
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:33.180] do
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:33.360] the
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:33.760] individual
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.260] parts.
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.080] So
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:36.180] if
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:36.260] we
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:36.500] already
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:37.080] have
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.000] NFAs
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:38.200] that
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:38.420] do
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:38.760] R1
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:38.920] and
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:39.360] R2,
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.440] then
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.000] the
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:42.380] closure
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:42.780] under
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:43.380] union
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.060] construction
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:44.720] gives
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:44.920] us
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.100] an
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:45.720] NFA
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:46.180] that
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:46.640] does
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.560] R1
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:47.780] union
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:48.720] R2
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:50.060] as
[00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:50.160] a
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:50.480] language.
[00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:51.390] So
[00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:51.630] I'm
[00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:51.710] going
[00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.850] to
[00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:51.990] do
[00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.150] the
[00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.690] I
[00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:52.830] hope
[00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:53.090] that's
[00:56:53.090 --> 00:56:53.350] clear,
[00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:53.590] but
[00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:54.170] I'm
[00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:54.290] going
[00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.430] to
[00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.670] do
[00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:54.850] an
[00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:55.210] example,
[00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.470] which
[00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.630] I'll
[00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:56.290] hopefully
[00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:56.910] illustrate
[00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:57.230] it.
[00:56:57.330 --> 00:56:57.410] And
[00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.570] it's
[00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:57.670] going
[00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.770] to
[00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.990] show
[00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.290] you,
[00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:59.690] basically
[00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:00.070] what
[00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:00.230] I'm
[00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.450] giving
[00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:00.570] you
[00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:00.650] is
[00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.910] an
[00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:01.370] automatic
[00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.950] procedure
[00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:02.770] for
[00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:03.230] converting
[00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.570] a
[00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:03.830] regular
[00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:04.350] expression
[00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:04.950] into
[00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:05.130] an
[00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:05.550] equivalent
[00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:06.130] NFA.
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:07.320] So
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:07.500] let's
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:07.600] just
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:07.780] see
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:09.440] that
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.580] procedure
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:10.900] in
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:11.860] action,
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:12.660] which
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:12.780] is
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:12.940] really
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:13.180] just
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:13.600] following
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:14.540] this
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:15.420] recipe
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:15.700] that
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:15.820] I
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:16.160] described
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:16.320] for
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:16.440] you.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:17.120] So
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:17.360] here
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:17.480] is
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:17.580] a
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:17.800] regular
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:18.340] expression,
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:18.660] A
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:18.900] union
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.260] AB,
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:21.680] star.
[00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:23.510] So
[00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.670] this
[00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.750] is
[00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.870] a
[00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:24.070] regular
[00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:24.570] expression.
[00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:25.630] It's
[00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.850] some
[00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:26.230] language,
[00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:26.510] whatever
[00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.750] it
[00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.870] is,
[00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.970] I
[00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:27.070] don't
[00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:27.290] care.
[00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.970] But
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:28.440] I
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:28.540] want
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:28.640] to
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:28.860] make
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:29.020] an
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:29.480] NFA
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.160] which
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.220] recognizes
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:31.600] that
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:31.940] same
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.360] language.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.160] And
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:33.260] the
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:33.360] way
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:33.520] I'm
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:33.560] going
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:33.660] to
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:33.840] do
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.180] that
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:34.700] is
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.080] first
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:35.540] build
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:36.400] NFA
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:36.920] for
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.780] the
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:38.980] components,
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:41.520] the
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:41.820] sub
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:42.460]-expressions
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:42.740] of
[00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:42.940] this
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:43.260] regular
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:43.800] expression,
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:44.680] and
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:44.980] then
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:45.760] combine
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.160] them
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:46.740] using
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.040] our
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:47.400] closure
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.260] constructions
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:48.980] to
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:49.760] be
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.200] NFAs
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:52.460] for
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:52.920] larger
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:53.100] and
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:53.360] larger
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:53.700] sub
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.260]-expressions
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:54.680] until
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:54.880] I
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:54.980] get
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:55.120] the
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:55.580] NFA
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:56.120] that's
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:56.400] the
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.180] equivalent
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:57.600] of
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:57.740] the
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:58.180] entire
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.000] expression.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:57:59.820] So
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:00.060] let's
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:00.160] just
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:00.280] see
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:00.400] how
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:00.540] that
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:00.800] goes.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:01.360] So
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:01.740] the
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:01.980] very
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.600] most
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:02.960] primitive
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:03.400] parts,
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:03.580] some
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:03.680] of
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.240] the
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:04.640] smallest
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.340] sub
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:05.780]-expressions
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:06.060] here
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:06.240] are
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:06.460] just
[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:06.720] the
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.180] sub
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:07.620]-expressions
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:07.820] for
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:08.100] A
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:08.580] and
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:08.720] for
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:08.920] B.
[00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:09.990] So
[00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.390] here's
[00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.550] the
[00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:10.710] one
[00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:11.390] just
[00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:12.430] for
[00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.730] A.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:13.980] So
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:14.180] this
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:14.280] is
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:14.420] the
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:14.760] NFA
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.060] which
[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:17.180] recognizes
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:18.420] the
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:18.800] language
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.160] which
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:19.300] is
[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:19.520] just
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:19.700] the
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:19.900] one
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:20.280] string,
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:20.580] A.
[00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:21.990] Here's
[00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.110] the
[00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:22.670] NFA
[00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:23.090] whose
[00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:23.970] language
[00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:24.110] is
[00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:24.250] just
[00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:24.350] the
[00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:24.530] one
[00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.770] string,
[00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:25.050] B.
[00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:26.050] And
[00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:27.490] now
[00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:28.590] I
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:28.840] want
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:28.980] an
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:29.520] NFA
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.540] which
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:31.940] accepts
[00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:32.420] only
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:32.680] the
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:33.000] string
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:33.360] AB.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:34.420] Now,
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:34.500] of
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:34.620] course,
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:34.760] you
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:34.880] could
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:35.060] just
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:35.200] do
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:35.440] that
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.040] by
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:36.560] hand
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:37.780] yourself.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:38.000] It's
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:38.260] simple
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:38.620] enough.
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:39.120] But
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:39.360] what
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:39.880] I'm
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.280] arguing
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:40.620] is
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:40.840] that
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:41.040] we
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.240] can
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:41.420] do
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:41.660] this
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:42.360] automatically
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:43.440] using
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:43.680] the
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.020] closure
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:44.640] construction
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.060] for
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:45.820] concatenation,
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:46.060] because
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:46.460] really,
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.660] there's
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:47.760] a
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.000] hidden
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.460] concatenation
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:49.800] symbol.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:50.300] This
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:50.480] is
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:50.960] the
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.620] A
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:52.380] concatenate
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:52.580] B.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.000] So
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:54.240] now
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:54.480] for
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:54.800] AB,
[00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:56.630] I'm
[00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.730] going
[00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:56.850] to
[00:58:56.850 --> 00:58:57.230] take
[00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:58.950] the
[00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:59.230] thing
[00:58:59.230 --> 00:58:59.510] from
[00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.810] A
[00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:00.750] and
[00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.890] the
[00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:01.070] part
[00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:01.270] from
[00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.630] B,
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:02.640] so
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:02.860] these
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:03.400] two
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:03.660] things
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:03.780] that
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:03.880] I
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:04.040] had
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:04.200] from
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:04.700] before,
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:05.700] and
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:05.960] use
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:06.220] the
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.040] concatenation
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:07.780] construction
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:08.440] to
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:08.820] combine
[00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:09.060] them.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:11.620] You
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:11.760] see
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.000] that?
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:12.420] So
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:12.620] now
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:12.760] I
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:12.920] have
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:13.460] automatically
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.520] an
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.040] NFA
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:15.300] which
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:15.680] does
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:15.940] the
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:16.340] language
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:16.720] whose
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:17.060] string
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:17.300] is
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:17.640] just
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:18.020] AB,
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:19.560] just
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:19.720] the
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:19.920] AB
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.240] string.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:21.760] And
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:22.320] it's
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:22.460] not
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:22.660] the
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:23.000] simplest
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:23.500] NFA.
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:23.660] You
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:23.800] can
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:23.960] make
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.100] a
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:24.340] simpler
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:24.700] one.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.080] But
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:25.320] the
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:25.540] virtue
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:25.740] of
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:25.900] this
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.080] one
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:26.240] is
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:26.420] that
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:26.580] I
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:26.800] got
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:26.920] it
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.420] automatically
[00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:29.350] just
[00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:29.550] by
[00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:29.970] following
[00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:30.490] the
[00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:30.750] closure
[00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:31.250] construction.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:32.220] So
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:32.440] now
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:32.620] I'm
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:32.680] going
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:32.760] to
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:32.900] do
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:33.040] a
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:33.220] more
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:33.700] complex
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:34.060] one,
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.360] just
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:34.520] the
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:34.940] inside
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:35.120] here,
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:35.440] A
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:35.740] union
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:36.020] AB.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.000] So
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:40.180] the
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:40.360] way
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:40.520] I'm
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:40.620] going
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:40.700] to
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:40.880] build
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.160] that
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:41.380] is
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:41.560] from
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:41.680] the
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:41.840] two
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:42.200] parts,
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:42.480] the
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:42.720] A
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:43.020] part
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:43.280] and
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:43.420] the
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:43.640] AB
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:44.000] part,
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:45.040] the
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:45.260] A
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:45.520] part
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:45.660] and
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:45.780] the
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:45.980] AB
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:46.300] part.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.120] So
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:47.320] here
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:47.460] is
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:47.600] the
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:47.780] A
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.040] part.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.100] Here's
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:49.240] the
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:49.520] AB
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.440] part.
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:50.740] I've
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:50.900] already
[00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:51.180] got
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:51.360] those
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:51.480] from
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:51.820] before.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.120] It's
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:52.300] really
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:52.480] kind
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:52.540] of
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:52.640] a
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:52.780] proof
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:52.940] by
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:53.240] induction
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:53.600] here.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:54.120] But
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:54.780] I
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:54.960] think
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.560] it's
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:55.940] simple
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:56.220] enough.
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:56.380] We
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:56.520] don't
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:56.680] have
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:56.800] to
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.000] use
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:57.180] that
[00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:57.560] language.
[00:59:58.780 --> 00:59:59.140] So
[00:59:59.140 --> 00:59:59.340] we
[00:59:59.340 --> 00:59:59.720] have
[01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:02.530] the
[01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:02.730] A
[01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:02.970] part,
[01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:03.170] the
[01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.410] AB
[01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.870] part.
[01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.270] And
[01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:04.430] now
[01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.590] we
[01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:04.710] are
[01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.810] going
[01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:04.890] to
[01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:05.250] apply
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.840] the
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.300] closure
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:09.680] under
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.120] union
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:10.720] construction
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.080] to
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:11.500] combine
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:11.760] those
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:11.960] into
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.180] one
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:12.500] machine.
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:12.860] And
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:13.140] remember
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:13.320] how
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:13.520] that
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:13.840] worked.
[01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.730] We
[01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:15.870] had
[01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:15.990] a
[01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.190] new
[01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.510] symbol
[01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.910] here,
[01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:17.310] which
[01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:17.690] branches
[01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.970] under
[01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:18.230] empty

[01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.690] to
[01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:18.830] the
[01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:19.250] previous.
[01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:21.070] We're
[01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:21.230] adding
[01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.350] a
[01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:21.470] new
[01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.730] start
[01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:21.970] state,
[01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:22.190] which
[01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.510] branches
[01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.690] to
[01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:22.810] the
[01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:23.050] original
[01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:23.370] start
[01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:23.670] states
[01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.930] under
[01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:24.170] empty
[01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:25.130] transition.
[01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.550] And
[01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:26.070] now
[01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:26.530] this
[01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:26.950] is
[01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:28.330] an
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:28.800] NFA
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.040] for
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:29.240] this

[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:29.860] A
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:30.060] union
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:30.340] AB.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:31.920] And
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.260] lastly,
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:32.620] now
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:32.740] we're
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:32.960] one
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.160] step
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:33.420] away
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:33.660] from
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:34.000] getting
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.200] the

[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:35.680] of
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:35.980] this.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:36.700] And
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:36.860] how
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:36.920] are
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:36.960] we
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.060] going
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:37.120] to
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:37.240] do
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:37.500] that?
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:38.520] We're
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:38.600] going
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:38.700] to
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.300] take
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:39.680] this
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:39.980] thing
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.360] here
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.020] and
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:41.360] apply
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:41.600] the

[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:42.360] for
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:42.540] the
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:42.920] star
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.800] closure.
[01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:45.070] And
[01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:45.330] that's
[01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:45.450] going
[01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:45.530] to
[01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:45.790] be
[01:00:45.790 --> 01:00:46.050] an
[01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:46.550] NFA
[01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:47.030] which
[01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.330] does
[01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:47.630] A
[01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.850] union
[01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:48.130] AB
[01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:48.490] star,
[01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:48.750] which
[01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:48.870] is
[01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:49.030] what
[01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:49.170] we
[01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:49.410] wanted
[01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:49.610] in
[01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:49.710] the
[01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.870] first
[01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:50.190] place.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:51.280] So
[01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:52.870] first,
[01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:53.010] we're
[01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:53.110] going
[01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:53.810] to
[01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.280] bring
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:55.460] that
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:55.580] one
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:55.800] down,
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.100] because
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:56.340] we've
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:56.500] already
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:56.780] built
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:56.960] that
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.200] one.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:57.660] And
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:57.840] now
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.180] remember
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:58.360] how
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:58.500] we
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:58.760] built
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.660] the
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.140] closure
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:01.360] under
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:01.720] star.
[01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:03.270] We
[01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.470] made
[01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:04.050] the
[01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:04.470] accepting
[01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.850] states
[01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:05.170] return
[01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:05.470] back
[01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.630] to
[01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:06.490] the
[01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:06.770] start
[01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:07.110] state,
[01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:07.770] and
[01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:07.930] we
[01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:08.170] added
[01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:08.350] a
[01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:08.490] new
[01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:08.730] start
[01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:09.050] state
[01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:09.450] to
[01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:09.590] make
[01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:09.730] sure
[01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:09.850] we
[01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:09.970] got
[01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:10.090] the
[01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:10.270] empty
[01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.530] string
[01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:10.690] in
[01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:10.970] there
[01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:11.930] that
[01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:12.330] transitioned
[01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:12.530] to
[01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:12.650] the
[01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.890] original
[01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:13.130] start
[01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.370] state
[01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.650] under
[01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:14.010] epsilon.
[01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:15.830] So
[01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:16.090] that's
[01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:16.430] all
[01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:17.530] I
[01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:17.790] wanted
[01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:17.970] to
[01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:18.230] say
[01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.690] for
[01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:19.010] today's
[01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.370] lecture.
[01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:19.950] That's
[01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:20.050] a
[01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:20.290] quick
[01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:20.730] review.
[01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:22.690] We
[01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:23.290] have
[01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:23.470] a
[01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:23.730] very
[01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:24.110] important
[01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:24.650] concept,
[01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.750] nondeterminism
[01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:26.270] and
[01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:27.230] nondeterministic
[01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.490] finite
[01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:28.010] automata.
[01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.510] We
[01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.850] proved
[01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:29.030] they're
[01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.350] equivalent
[01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:29.630] in
[01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:30.050] power,
[01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:32.150] showed
[01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.310] the
[01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:32.550] class
[01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:32.670] of
[01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.870] regular
[01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:33.230] languages
[01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.650] closed
[01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:34.090] under
[01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:34.870] concatenation
[01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:35.070] and
[01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:35.470] star.
[01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:36.110] We
[01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:36.270] showed
[01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.430] how
[01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.530] to
[01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:36.630] do
[01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:37.070] conversion
[01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:37.230] of
[01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.410] regular
[01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:37.930] expressions
[01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:38.130] to
[01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:38.650] NFAs.
[01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:40.430] So
[01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.030] I
[01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.230] think
[01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.530] that
[01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:41.970] is
[01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:42.550] it
[01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:43.110] for
[01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:44.450] today's
[01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:45.110] lecture.
[01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.810] And
[01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:47.090] thank
[01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:47.930] you
[01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:48.050] all
[01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:48.170] for
[01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.310] being
[01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:48.510] here.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:50.540] I'll
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:50.720] try
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:50.840] to
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.040] answer
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:51.200] a
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:51.300] few
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:51.440] of
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:51.660] these.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:56.920] Why
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:57.120] does
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:57.800] concatenation
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.060] have
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:58.400] order?
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:01:58.820] Well,
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:01:59.060] because
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:01:59.300] it's
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:01:59.400] an
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:01:59.700] ordered
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.460] construction.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:02.580] Is
[01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:03.090] there
[01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:03.230] a
[01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.450] simple
[01:02:03.450 --> 01:02:03.870] way
[01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:04.130] to
[01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.410] prove
[01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:04.750] closure
[01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:04.990] under
[01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.590] concatenation
[01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:05.890] without
[01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:06.230] using
[01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:07.050] nondeterminism?
[01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.510] No.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:10.600] Why
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:10.760] are
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:10.880] the
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.080] empty
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:11.420] strings
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:11.720] at
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:11.860] the
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.140] accept
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:12.460] state?
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.000] Can't
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.080] they
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:13.220] be
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:13.460] at
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:13.760] any
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.060] state?
[01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.910] Doesn't
[01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:17.150] star
[01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.330] make
[01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:17.670] copies
[01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.850] of
[01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:18.030] any
[01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:18.250] part
[01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:18.350] of
[01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:18.450] the
[01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:18.690] input?
[01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:19.550] No,
[01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:19.730] it's
[01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:20.030] only
[01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.350] you
[01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:20.470] have
[01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.590] to
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.320] think
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:22.440] about
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:22.620] what's
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:22.840] going
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.260] on.
[01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:25.250] You
[01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.550] don't
[01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:25.690] want
[01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:25.790] to,
[01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:26.090] you
[01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:26.290] have
[01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:26.530] to
[01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:27.090] branch
[01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:27.290] back
[01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:27.430] to
[01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.550] the
[01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:27.750] beginning
[01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:28.150] only
[01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.430] on
[01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.550] an
[01:02:28.550 --> 01:02:28.990] accept,
[01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:29.630] because
[01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.830] that
[01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:30.010] means
[01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:30.250] you've
[01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:30.470] found
[01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.630] a
[01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.870] piece
[01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:31.130] that's
[01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.230] in
[01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.350] the
[01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:31.630] original
[01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:32.110] language.
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:34.820] Is
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:34.940] there
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:35.120] an
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:35.460] automaton
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:35.720] that
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:35.900] can
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.140] add
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:36.540] some
[01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:37.850] sum
[01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:37.950] or
[01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:38.470] subtract?
[01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:39.590] Memory
[01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:40.070] automata.
[01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:41.730] Well,
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:42.560] depends
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:42.680] what
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:42.840] you
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:42.980] mean
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.120] by
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:43.320] all
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:43.560] that.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:44.400] But
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.440] certainly,
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:46.640] there
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:46.720] are
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:46.880] more
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.200] powerful
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:47.580] machines
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:47.740] that
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:47.840] we're
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:47.940] going
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.020] to
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:48.260] study
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:48.420] than
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:48.700] finite
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:49.520] automata.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:50.320] So
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:53.020] yes,
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:55.320] there
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:55.760] is.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:56.580] And
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:56.880] even
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.300] finite
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:57.780] automata
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.240] can
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:58.420] add
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:58.540] and
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:58.840] subtract
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.480] if
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:02:59.600] you
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:02:59.860] present
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.020] the
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:00.220] input
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:00.360] in
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:00.460] the
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:00.580] right
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:00.820] way.
[01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:02.450] I
[01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.890] refer
[01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:03.190] you
[01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.410] to
[01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.550] the
[01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:03.730] first
[01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:04.070] problem
[01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:04.190] on
[01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.270] the
[01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:04.470] homework.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:06.660] So
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:06.880] I
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.000] think
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:07.180] I'm
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:07.300] going
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:07.580] to
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.720] check
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:08.940] out
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.240] then.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.040] Take
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:12.220] care,
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:12.520] everybody.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:12.880] Bye
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:13.020] bye.
