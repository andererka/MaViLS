[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.880] Hi,
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.240] everyone,
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.600] and

[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.260] MIT
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.200] class
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.380] in
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.620] Urban
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.980] Energy
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.520] Systems.
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.220] Wherever
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.480] you're
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.700] seeing
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.860] this
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.280] lecture,
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.220] please
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.680] subscribe.
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.260] You
[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.400] can
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.680] either
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.100] find
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.260] it
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.460] on
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.640] the
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.840] web
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.140] page
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.280] where
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.400] you
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.580] found
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.760] this
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.260] video
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.120] or
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.620] ask
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.100] the
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.600] instructor.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.880] So
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.180] let's
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.340] get
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.640] back
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.180] to
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.740] the
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.100] topic
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.640] for
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.060] today,
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.660] which
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.900] is
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.080] going
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.300] to
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.640] be
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.460] cities
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.740] and
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.520] decarbonization.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.140] What
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.400] is
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.540] the
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.740] role
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.900] of
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.200] cities?
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.360] Again,
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.220] I'm
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.440] David
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.820] Hsu.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.340] And
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.580] if
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.800] you're
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.420] thinking
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.020] about
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.760] how
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.060] cities
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.200] can
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.460] take
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.980] action
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.500] or
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.700] what
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.880] their
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.120] roles
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.260] in
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.960] decarbonization,
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.500] you
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.680] have
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.020] found
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.160] the
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.340] right
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.740] place
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.040] and
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.220] your
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.560] people.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.460] So
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.940] I
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.060] want
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.160] to
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.400] cover
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.660] just
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.120] briefly
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.520] how
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.720] you're
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.760] going
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.760] to
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.020] prepare
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.220] for
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.680] class
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.860] this
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.060] week.
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.240] This
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.340] is
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.480] our
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.780] second
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.260] class.
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.360] I
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.440] want
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.500] to
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.660] make
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.840] sure
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.160] that
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.940] everyone's
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.260] caught
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.540] up.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.680] First,
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.980] the
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.300] introductory
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.640] reading
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.840] from
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.040] last
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.400] week.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.000] It's
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.260] fairly
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.700] short
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.900] and
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.300] skimmable,
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.680] so
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.840] it's
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.060] easy
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.220] to
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.460] catch
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.780] up,
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.260] but
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.420] you
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.700] should
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.000] catch
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.280] up.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.840] And
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.940] it's
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.260] particularly
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.860] important
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.260] to
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.420] look
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.560] at
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.100] Mackay
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.660] chapter
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.280] two.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.340] Again,
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.520] it's
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.980] Mackay
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.400] chapter
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.860] two.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.560] There's
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.700] an
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.960] initial
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.480] problem
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.800] set
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.120] due
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.580] Monday
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.840] night.
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.420] You
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.720] can
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.060] just
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.480] access
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.840] the
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.220] problem
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.400] set
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.560] by
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.860] going
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.200] directly
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.380] to
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.600] this
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.840] Google
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.340] form,
[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.780] the
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.020] link
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.160] on
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.300] the
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.640] screen.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.160] You
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.320] should
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.480] do
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.620] the
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.820] reading
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.980] for
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.160] this
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.460] week.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.860] That's
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.980] on
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.120] the
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.400] syllabus.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.120] I'll
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.440] also
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.700] show
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.860] the
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.100] reading
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.260] for
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.440] this
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.660] week
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.940] on
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:25.060] the
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.260] next
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.780] page.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.540] And
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.680] then
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.780] you
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.960] should
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.600] watch
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.780] the
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.940] rest
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.060] of
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.180] this
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.360] video
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.720] lecture.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.620] And
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.980] during
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.160] the
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.460] reading
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.960] and
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.260] while
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.540] watching
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.660] the
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.840] video
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.160] lecture,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.640] it's
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.980] important
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.180] for
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.260] you
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.380] to
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.560] write
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.740] down
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.880] the
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.220] questions
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.420] that
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.500] you
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.820] have
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.960] for
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.480] discussion.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.140] And
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.320] then
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.400] I
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.500] want
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.580] you
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.720] to
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.940] feel
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.160] free
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.360] to
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.540] share
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.660] them
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.840] on
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.260] Slack,
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.860] whenever,
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.660] asynchronously,
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.440] or
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.680] in
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.820] our
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.160] class
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.440] meeting
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.760] on
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.100] Tuesday.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.460] So
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.600] the
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.880] materials
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.060] for
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.320] today,
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.820] again,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.940] I
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.100] won't
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.280] go
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.440] over
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.640] them.
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.940] These
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.040] are
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.200] all
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.300] in
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.420] your
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.740] syllabus,
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.200] but
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.360] these
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.460] will
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.700] also
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.840] be
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.920] in
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.000] the
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.340] slides
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.600] so
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.740] you
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.920] can
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.180] follow
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.380] the
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.660] links.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.380] The
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.660] first
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.900] four
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.260] readings
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.540] are
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.720] the
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.240] required
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.680] readings,
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.460] a
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.020] kind
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.160] of
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.640] gathering
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.020] of
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.480] very
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.840] different
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.220] readings.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.920] And
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.040] then
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.160] the
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.460] last
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.620] two
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.900] readings
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.120] are
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.520] optional
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.860] readings
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.240] that
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.680] give
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.300] additional
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.080] information
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.840] to
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.280] the
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.840] articles
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.160] above.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.760] So
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.940] what
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.000] I
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.120] want
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.220] to
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.420] start
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.600] with
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.920] is
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.300] Mackay
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.700] chapter
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.100] two,
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.620] what
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.900] he
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.160] calls
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.320] the
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.620] balance
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.960] sheet.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.500] And
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.640] it's
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.800] an
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.240] important
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.620] set
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.740] of
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.300] concepts,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.800] simply
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.000] so
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.140] we
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.260] can
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.620] think
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.020] about
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.260] the
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.500] energy
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.920] system.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.880] And
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.320] very
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.760] simply,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.200] what
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.560] Mackay
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.700] is
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.860] trying
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.960] to
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.040] do
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.120] in
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.260] his
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.560] book
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.120] is
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.580] contrast
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.040] these
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.480] red
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.840] and
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.200] green
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.600] bars.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.740] Energy
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.340] consumption
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.700] is
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.820] on
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.940] the
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.220] left
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.420] in
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.700] red
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.480] and
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.780] energy
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.240] production
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.620] is
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.780] on
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.900] the
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.200] right
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.400] in
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.640] green.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.300] And
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.460] so
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.620] when
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.980] Mackay
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.720] titles
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.920] his
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.180] book,
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.980] Sustainable
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.340] Energy
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.640] Without
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.860] the
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.060] Hot
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.280] Air,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.860] what
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.980] we're
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.220] trying
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.340] to
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.440] do
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.540] is
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.980] replace
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.540] our
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.180] current
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.600] level
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.800] of
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.180] consumption
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.280] with
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.840] entirely
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.340] renewable
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.900] resources.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.300] And
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.520] that's
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.640] how
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.760] we're
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.900] going
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.040] to
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.420] achieve
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.600] a
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.940] sustainable
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.260] energy
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.680] system.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.560] And
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.900] so
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.440] a
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.220] sustainable
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.560] energy
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.080] system
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.800] would
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.060] be
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.380] if
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.700] our
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.080] total
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.620] conceivable
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.080] sustainable

[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.180] sources
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.580] on
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.700] the
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.980] right
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.420] are
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.740] greater
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.980] than
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.140] our
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.360] total
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.900] consumption.
[00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.950] And
[00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.110] an
[00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.710] unsustainable
[00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.990] energy
[00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.530] system
[00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.050] would
[00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.190] be
[00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.350] where
[00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.510] our
[00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.810] total
[00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.330] consumption
[00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.690] of
[00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.050] energy
[00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.670] is
[00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.010] larger
[00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.230] than
[00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.390] our
[00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.690] total
[00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.290] conceivable
[00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.850] sustainable
[00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.310] production.
[00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.810] And
[00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.970] of
[00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.190] course,
[00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.530] these
[00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.790] two
[00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.070] bars
[00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.430] will
[00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.790] change
[00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.950] over
[00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.410] time
[00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.970] as
[00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.110] our
[00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.850] expectations
[00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.250] around
[00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.810] consumption
[00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.970] change
[00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.170] and
[00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.330] our
[00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.050] technologies
[00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.570] and
[00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.070] our
[00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.430] institutions
[00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.670] and
[00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.830] our
[00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.190] markets
[00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.390] for
[00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.710] sustainable
[00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.130] production
[00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.650] change.
[00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.110] But
[00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.450] that's
[00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.590] the
[00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.970] challenge.
[00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.270] The
[00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.590] challenge
[00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.750] is
[00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.870] to

[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.200] that
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.320] might

[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.020] like
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.340] is

[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.560] It's
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.660] the

[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.140] And
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.260] the

[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.840] one,

[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.000] It's
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.160] the

[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.860] What
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.940] are
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:07.100] our

[00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.730] Energy
[00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.130] can
[00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.310] be

[00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.290] Energy
[00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.790] equals

[00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.570] This

[00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.810] a

[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.840] but
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.920] we
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.060] have

[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.760] That's
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.900] because
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.220] that's
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.380] how

[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.700] But
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.020] again,
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.320] the

[00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.150] So
[00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.350] just
[00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.450] to
[00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:39.570] give
[00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.650] you
[00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.730] a

[00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.010] foolishly
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.600] counting

[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.140] realizing
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.320] you
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.680] worked
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:49.840] out
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.000] for
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.160] an

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.920] it
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:51.920] was
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.120] only
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.460] equivalent

[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:54.580] You
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:54.800] can
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.040] also
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.340] look

[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.400] gallons
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:10.660] of
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:10.880] oil,
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:11.800] 7
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.400].89
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:12.780] pounds
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:12.940] of
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.180] coal,
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:13.780] and
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.520] 252

[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:16.840] day.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:17.580] Now
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:17.820] it's
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:17.940] just
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:18.160] worth
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.540] pointing

[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.080] that

[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.620] household
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.080] is

[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:22.640] kilowatt
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.040] hours,
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.340] but
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:23.540] only
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:23.840] counts
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:23.980] for
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.520] electricity.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.680] That's
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:25.760] for
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:25.860] the
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.060] whole
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.560] household
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:26.900] per
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.200] year.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:27.940] The
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.340] second
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:28.860] sentence
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.420] measures

[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.380] basis,
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.320] but
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.520] then
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:32.960] breaks
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.320] the

[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:36.860] because
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.120] of

[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.340] of
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:38.680] energy.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.340] And
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:39.520] this
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:39.640] is
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:39.800] to
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.000] say
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.220] that
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:40.400] when
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:40.540] we
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:40.720] do
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:40.940] these
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.460] comparisons,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.140] we
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.300] wanna
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.500] be
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:42.820] careful
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.140] about
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.320] the

[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:43.740] we
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.040] use,
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:44.580] the
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:44.940] averaging
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.320] over
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.800] time,
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.240] and

[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:47.920] because
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.280] the
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.600] original
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.060] source
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:49.180] of
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:49.560] energy
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:49.980] may
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.140] not
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.440] actually
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:50.620] be
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:50.760] how
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:50.920] much
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.380] energy
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:51.680] we
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:51.920] use
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.040] in
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.140] the
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:52.420] end.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:52.760] And
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:52.840] we'll
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.100] talk
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.260] about
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.440] that
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:53.740] more
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.240] in
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.360] a
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:54.600] few
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.040] slides.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:56.940] Another
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.260] key
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:57.500] physical
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:57.960] concept
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.400] we
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:58.520] have
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:58.620] to
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:58.880] talk
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.200] about
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.420] or
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.060] will
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.180] be
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.360] very
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:00.680] useful
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.300] is
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:01.760] power.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.380] And
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:02.520] that's
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:02.660] the
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.120] quantitative
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.720] rate
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:03.980] of
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.280] doing
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:04.660] work.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:05.480] That
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:05.780] is,
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:06.740] power
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.020] is
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:07.720] energy
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.120] per
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.640] time.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:09.840] It's
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:09.960] a
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.160] rate.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.100] The
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.400] units
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:11.580] we
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:11.880] use
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.100] of
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.320] that
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.680] are
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.360] watts
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.980] or
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.540] equal
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:14.820] to
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.120] joules
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.360] per
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:15.800] second.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:16.800] Other
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.320] forms
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:18.660] of
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:18.980] power
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.120] that
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.200] you
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.300] might
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:19.440] be
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:19.740] familiar
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.040] with
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.320] are
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:20.820] ergs,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.260] amperes
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:22.500] in
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:22.680] terms
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:22.800] of
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:22.960] electric
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.480] current,
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.420] horsepower
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.000] in

[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:25.500] of
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:25.640] the
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.000] engine
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.200] in
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.340] your
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:26.720] car
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.180] or
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:27.500] other
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.020] motors,
[00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:29.410] and
[00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:29.850] lumens
[00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.330] are
[00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:30.670] the
[00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.570] amount
[00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:31.990] of
[00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.390] energy
[00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.090] cast
[00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.490] off
[00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.250] per
[00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.770] second
[00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:35.610] from
[00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:35.810] an
[00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.030] LED
[00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.390] light
[00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:36.610] bulb,
[00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:37.190] but
[00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.570] measured
[00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:37.930] over
[00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:38.150] a
[00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.450] sphere
[00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:38.730] around
[00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:38.830] a
[00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:38.970] light
[00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.170] bulb.
[00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.370] So
[00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:39.450] it's
[00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:39.710] actually
[00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.990] weighted
[00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.210] by
[00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:40.410] the
[00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:40.750] area
[00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.130] around
[00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:41.230] the
[00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.390] light
[00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:41.590] bulb
[00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.930] or
[00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:42.130] what
[00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:42.790] degree
[00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.110] of
[00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.510] area
[00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.590] is
[00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.570] putting
[00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:46.770] off
[00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:46.970] how
[00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:47.170] much

[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.360] In

[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:26.880] You
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.040] can
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.360] measure
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:27.780] greenhouse
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.200] gases
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.520] per

[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:31.940] People
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.160] use
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:32.380] lots

[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:33.900] And
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:33.980] the

[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.260] why
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:34.320] I
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:34.420] wanna

[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.360] emissions,
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:13.940] and
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:14.240] frankly,
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:14.480] the
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:14.940] actions
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.120] that
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.200] they're
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.520] taking
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:15.740] to
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.040] reduce
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.160] their
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.440] greenhouse
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:16.980] gases,
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:17.500] they
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:17.680] have
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:17.840] to
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.120] measure
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.380] or
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:18.860] report
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.120] their
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.380] greenhouse
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:19.820] gases
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.200] in
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.420] terms
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:20.580] of
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:20.700] a
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.060] specific
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.500] inventory
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:21.980] format.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:22.640] So
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:22.840] I've
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.000] linked
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.100] to
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.320] that
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:23.640] here.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.160] You
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.340] can
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.560] click
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:24.740] on
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:24.860] it
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.040] and
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.140] you
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.280] can
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.640] see
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.160] how
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.720] countries
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.520] report
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.060] different
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.340] kinds
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:28.440] of
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:28.640] greenhouse
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.260] gases.
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:29.940] It's
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.360] because
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.220] countries
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:31.400] can
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:31.700] only
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:31.920] see
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.160] the
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.600] source
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.200] of
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.320] the
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.040] activities
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.560] that
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:34.900] create
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.160] greenhouse
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:35.560] gases.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.200] So
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.360] it's
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:36.660] easier
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:36.880] for
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:36.980] us
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:37.100] to
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:37.360] measure
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:37.960] how
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.120] many
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.380] barrels
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:38.560] of
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:38.840] oil
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.140] we
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:39.480] burned,
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:40.020] or
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:40.180] how
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.380] many
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:40.740] short
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.060] tons
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:41.280] of
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:41.460] coal
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:41.600] we
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:41.920] burned,
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.660] or
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:42.960] let's
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.180] say
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.360] how
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:43.540] much
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:43.840] land
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.000] use
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.500] conversion
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:44.720] has
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:44.860] led
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.020] to
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:45.320] how
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.540] much
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:45.980] methane
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.140] or
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.260] how

[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:46.920] dioxide.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.060] We
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.220] can
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:48.600] also
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.180] measure,
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:49.660] let's
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:49.920] say,
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:50.440] our
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:50.700] greenhouse
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.560] gas
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:51.940] emissions
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.500] per
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:52.880] unit
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:53.060] of
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.460] electricity
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:54.620] because
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.140] electricity
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.540] comes
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:55.760] from
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:55.900] a
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.180] grid.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:56.760] The
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.000] grid
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.160] is
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:57.260] a
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:57.620] technology
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:57.860] we'll
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.120] talk
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:58.320] about
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:58.440] a
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:58.580] lot
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:58.680] in
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:58.800] this
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.060] class
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:12:59.260] that
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:12:59.600] mixes
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.280] different
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:00.800] sources
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.200] of
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:01.520] energy
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:01.960] together.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:02.600] So
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:02.740] we
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:02.880] try
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.000] to
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.200] get
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.420] an
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:03.880] average
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.780] intensity
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.480] of
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:05.840] greenhouse
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.180] gas
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:06.600] emissions
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.200] per
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.500] unit
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:07.960] electricity
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.400] in
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:08.620] different
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.100] regions.
[00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.330] Another
[00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:10.650] emissions
[00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.250] intensity
[00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:11.890] factor
[00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:12.110] that
[00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.310] people
[00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.550] look
[00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.670] at
[00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.870] quite
[00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.110] often
[00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.250] is
[00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.470] air
[00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.830] quality.
[00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:14.410] You
[00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:14.530] can
[00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:14.710] look
[00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.890] at
[00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.210] how
[00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:15.390] many
[00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:15.710] greenhouse
[00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:16.250] gases
[00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.890] or
[00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.070] how
[00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:17.230] much
[00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.670] particulate
[00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.030] matter
[00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.690] is
[00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.570] produced
[00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.130] by
[00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.450] certain
[00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:20.930] activities,
[00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:21.430] like
[00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.870] vehicle
[00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.270] miles
[00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:22.730] traveled
[00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:23.330] or
[00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:23.550] number
[00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.710] of
[00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:24.050] cars
[00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.210] on
[00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:24.270] the
[00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:24.450] road.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.280] So
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.440] just
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:26.540] to
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:26.680] give
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:26.740] you
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:26.860] an
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.180] example
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:27.480] of

[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:28.580] intensity
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:28.900] looks
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.160] like,
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:29.920] this
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.060] is
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.240] the

[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:34.280] and
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:34.540] this
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:34.660] is

[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:36.440] And
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:36.660] you
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:36.780] can
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:36.980] see,
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:37.340] actually,
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:37.860] it's
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.080] measured

[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.640] And
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:52.720] you
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:52.840] can

[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:03.780] if
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.020] only
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.380] because
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:04.540] they
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:04.740] don't

[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:09.900] Now,
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:10.440] like
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:10.580] we
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:10.940] talked

[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:16.400] Well,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:16.540] there's
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:16.640] a

[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:19.780] distorts

[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:22.960] Small
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.320] places
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:23.600] don't

[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.180] places,
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:26.760] even
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:26.900] though
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.000] that
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.140] really
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:27.260] has
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:27.440] nothing
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:27.580] to
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:27.660] do
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:27.760] with
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:27.840] the
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.280] average.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.100] But
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.220] the
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:29.380] more
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:29.760] important
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.180] point
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:30.580] from
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:30.720] a
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:30.920] map
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.100] like
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:31.500] this
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:31.920] is
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.080] that
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.280] it
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:32.620] hides
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:32.820] the
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.120] fact
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.380] that
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:33.580] the
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:33.780] rich
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.200] countries,
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.140] like
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:35.980] Australia,
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:36.960] Europe,

[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.020] America,
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:39.740] simply
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.100] have
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:40.380] much
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:40.760] larger
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.420] GDPs.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.000] So
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.200] it
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:42.380] looks
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:42.620] like
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:42.820] the
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.100] carbon
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:43.500] dioxide

[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.300] is
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:46.620] low.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:47.520] But
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:47.600] if
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:47.680] we
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:47.940] look
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.020] at
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.160] the
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.380] per
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:48.680] capita

[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:49.620] emissions,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.180] like
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:50.340] the
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:50.580] point
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:50.740] in
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:50.840] our
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.080] last
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.400] class,
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:51.900] you
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:52.020] can
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:52.200] see
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:52.340] that
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:52.480] for
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:52.580] a
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:52.820] relatively
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.180] small

[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:53.920] in
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.120] those
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.480] rich
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:54.860] developed
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.360] countries,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.780] they
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:55.920] have
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.160] very

[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:58.900] And
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.060] so
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:14:59.300] your
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:14:59.820] map
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.200] basically
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:00.800] changes
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.400] diametrically.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:01.940] And
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.040] you
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.180] can
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:02.440] see
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:02.640] the
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:02.900] difference
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.160] between

[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:04.160] and

[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:04.840] countries.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.260] And
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:05.980] overwhelmingly,
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:06.500] the
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:06.660] richer
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.140] countries
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.420] are
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:07.600] more
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.180] responsible
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:08.600] for
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:08.780] carbon
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.080] dioxide
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.560] emissions.
[00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:11.910] If
[00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:12.010] we
[00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:12.330] look
[00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:12.430] at
[00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.670] this
[00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.330] similarly
[00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:13.710] in
[00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.030] kind
[00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.090] of
[00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.250] a

[00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:15.530] you
[00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.670] can
[00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.990] again
[00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.370] see
[00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.650] that
[00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.010] it
[00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:17.330] looks
[00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:17.530] like
[00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:17.650] on
[00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:17.810] an

[00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:21.230] different.
[00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:21.850] Of
[00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.030] course,
[00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:22.210] the

[00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:24.030] of

[00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.510] of
[00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:24.630] the

[00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:25.350] on
[00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.510] a

[00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.990] capita
[00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.550] basis,
[00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:27.250] the

[00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:28.910] States
[00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.890] produces
[00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:30.270] much
[00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:30.610] more
[00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:30.910] and
[00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.290] inevitably
[00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:31.890] consumes
[00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:32.150] much
[00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.450] more
[00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:32.810] than
[00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.950] your

[00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.250] So
[00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:35.530] even
[00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:35.870] though
[00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:36.790] we
[00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.170] have

[00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:42.150] more
[00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.390] in

[00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.010] And
[00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:44.230] I
[00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.410] make

[00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:59.050] at
[00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.090] least
[00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.250] a
[00:15:59.250 --> 00:15:59.650] comparable
[00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.130] carbon
[00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:00.330] emission
[00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:00.790] intensity
[00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:01.910] to
[00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:02.310] some
[00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.770] developing
[00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.230] countries.
[00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.510] Of
[00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:03.730] course,
[00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.350] this
[00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.010] hid
[00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:05.190] the
[00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:05.590] fact
[00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.050] that
[00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.130] the
[00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:06.270] United
[00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:06.650] States
[00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.890] is
[00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:07.170] both
[00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:07.990] richer
[00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.790] and
[00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:09.150] consumes
[00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.410] much
[00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.690] more
[00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:09.970] and
[00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:10.250] produces
[00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.530] much
[00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:10.990] more.
[00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.670] So
[00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.190] that's
[00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:12.350] just
[00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.510] a
[00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:12.710] way
[00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.070] to
[00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.390] talk
[00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:13.650] about
[00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:13.910] what
[00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.370] intensities
[00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:14.630] may
[00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:14.990] tell
[00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.210] us
[00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:15.470] and
[00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.610] what
[00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:15.730] they
[00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:15.890] may
[00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:16.290] hide
[00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:16.630] also.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.320] Now
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.440] I'm
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:18.500] gonna
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:18.600] get
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:18.720] to
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:18.840] a

[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:20.340] I
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:20.640] rather
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.120] love

[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.100] So
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:22.280] I'll
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:22.540] start

[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:28.660] energy
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.140] services.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:29.620] So
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:29.760] to
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:29.880] give
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:29.940] you
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.060] an
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.380] example,
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.240] you
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:31.400] can
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:31.640] see
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:31.920] how
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.460] I've
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:32.600] said
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.000] before,
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:33.280] the
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:33.520] electric
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:33.840] grid
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.340] mixes
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:34.760] many
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.140] different
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.780] types
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.220] of
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:36.660] energy
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.120] sources,
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.080] solar,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:38.680] nuclear,
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.180] hydro,
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:39.460] wind,
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:39.820] all
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:40.120] these
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:40.580] natural
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.000] gas
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.740] and
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.200] coal
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.760] all
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.000] feed
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.180] into
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.300] the
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:43.540] electric
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:43.860] grid.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.780] But
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.000] when
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.160] we
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:45.500] feed
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:45.660] that
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:45.940] energy
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.140] into
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:46.260] the
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:46.400] electric
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:46.760] grid,
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.040] into
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.340] power
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:47.800] plants,
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:48.380] we
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:48.740] basically
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.000] only
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.280] take
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:49.440] a
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:49.780] fraction
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:49.960] of
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.040] it.
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.100] It
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.260] looks
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:50.540] like
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:50.760] about
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.100] one
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.440] third
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:51.660] of
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:51.740] the
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.180] electricity,
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:52.960] one
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.140] third
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:53.240] of
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.360] the
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:53.780] energy
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.000] in
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.140] those
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.340] energy
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:54.720] sources
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.160] actually
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.500] goes
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.040] to
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:56.740] things
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:56.940] like
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.260] residential,
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:57.700] commercial,
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.200] industrial,
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.020] but
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:17:59.280] about
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:17:59.480] two
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:17:59.680] thirds
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:17:59.940] of
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.020] it
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:00.220] gets
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:00.700] rejected,
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.040] which
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.260] means
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:01.420] that
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:01.640] it's
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:01.940] heat
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.360] energy
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.120] going
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.480] out
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:03.680] of
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:03.860] the
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.180] chimney
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:04.420] of
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:04.560] a

[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.340] or
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:06.440] it
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:06.500] might
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:06.640] be
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:06.940] energy
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.360] lost
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:07.520] in
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:07.560] the
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:07.800] electric
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.120] grid
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:08.680] that's
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:08.880] simply
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.320] lost
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:09.660] because
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:09.800] of
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:09.860] the
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.260] resistance
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:10.720] of

[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.700] wires.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:12.700] And
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:12.940] so
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:13.660] this
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:13.840] kind
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.000] of

[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:14.740] actually
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:14.980] find
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:15.360] tremendously
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:15.800] useful
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.260] to
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:16.900] summarize
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.520] what
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:17.680] the

[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.120] of

[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:22.980] and
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.160] also
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.360] some

[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:24.800] where
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.100] we
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:25.260] might
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:25.360] be
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:25.440] able
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:25.560] to
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.040] capture
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.400] some

[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:38.840] To

[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:25.660] is
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:25.820] being
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.260] achieved
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:26.780] in

[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:27.980] This
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.120] is
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.520] essentially
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:28.780] an

[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:30.220] but
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:30.320] if
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:30.380] you

[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.040] it
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.240] gives
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:35.340] you
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:35.440] a
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:35.580] really
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:35.760] good
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.060] picture
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.300] of
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:36.420] where
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:36.520] the
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:36.720] energy
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:36.860] is
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.060] coming
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:37.500] from,
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:37.900] and
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.000] where
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.100] the

[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:38.420] is

[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:38.880] to.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.380] So
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:40.660] we
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:40.760] wanna
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.000] use

[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:47.300] I've
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:47.440] said

[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:49.760] it
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:49.900] is

[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:54.920] which
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.060] is
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:55.220] what

[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.840] says

[00:21:59.120 --> 00:21:59.320] And
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:21:59.560] so
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:21:59.880] the
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.100] key
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:00.340] thing

[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:08.940] recently,
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:09.900] is

[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:10.880] plans
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.260] agree
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:11.420] on

[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:12.720] are.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:13.340] So
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:13.520] we
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:13.680] should
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.220] focus
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:14.820] as
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.780] urban

[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:18.600] planners,
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:18.980] and
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.180] people
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:19.300] who
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:19.460] work
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:19.600] in

[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.420] on

[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:21.840] We
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:21.940] should
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.280] focus
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:22.480] on
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.020] geography.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:23.440] We
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:23.540] should
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:23.780] focus
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:23.920] on

[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:24.660] of
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:24.840] it.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:25.420] And
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:25.760] frankly,
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.080] as
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.460] planners,
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:26.700] we
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:26.840] should
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.180] look
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:27.440] at
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:27.600] the
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:27.940] land
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.140] use
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:28.340] and
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:28.480] built

[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.600] implications
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.140] of

[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.920] decarbonization.
[00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.670] So
[00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:33.870] look
[00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:33.950] at
[00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:34.050] the

[00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:37.190] They
[00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.430] look
[00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.650] at
[00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:37.890] the

[00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:43.730] And
[00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.830] this
[00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.910] is

[00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:45.110] I
[00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.270] think

[00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.370] You
[00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:49.510] can

[00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:55.610] we
[00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:55.790] will
[00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:56.090] get

[00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:58.030] we
[00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:58.190] get

[00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.670] You
[00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:05.790] can

[00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:06.390] renewables
[00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.750] here
[00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:07.290] are
[00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:07.610] relatively

[00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.090] hydro.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:11.140] And
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:11.400] all
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:11.600] the
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:11.860] energy
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.200] goes
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:12.380] through
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:12.620] these
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.000] intermediate

[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:19.440] It
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:19.620] gets

[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:21.560] And
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:21.680] it
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:21.960] ultimately
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.360] goes

[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.200] together.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:25.840] It

[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:29.560] as

[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:29.820] do
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:30.160] now,
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:30.800] and
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.020] so
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:31.300] this
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:31.420] is
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:31.560] one
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:31.940] important
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:32.240] point
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:32.340] I
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:32.420] want

[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.140] If
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:34.240] you
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:34.360] look
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:34.440] at
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:34.560] the
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:34.880] total

[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:36.880] it
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.100] actually
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:37.320] has
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:37.420] to
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:37.580] go
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:37.960] down
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.140] by

[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:39.580] and
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:39.740] this
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:39.920] is
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.040] the

[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:40.400] I
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:40.600] think

[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:40.860] made
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:40.940] in
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:41.020] the

[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.620] class,
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:41.860] which
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.180] is
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.080] if
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:43.220] you
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:43.400] look
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:43.660] back
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.040] here,

[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:46.400] looks
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:46.700] like,
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:46.800] I
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:46.960] think,

[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:47.620] 100

[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:49.660] think
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:49.780] is
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:49.900] how
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:50.060] this
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:50.280] paper
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:50.600] measures
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:50.800] it,
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.580] and
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:51.700] if
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:51.800] you
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:51.960] look
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.060] at
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:52.160] the

[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:53.200] you

[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:53.540] see

[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:55.400] have
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:55.620] gone
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:55.880] down
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.080] quite
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:56.200] a
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.480] bit,
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.180] which
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:57.340] is
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:57.500] to
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.160] make
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:58.360] the
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:58.620] point
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:58.780] that
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:58.900] I
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:26:59.040] think
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.140] I
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:26:59.300] said
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:26:59.420] to
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:26:59.520] you
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:26:59.720] last
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:26:59.960] week,
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:00.460] which
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:00.580] is
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:00.760] that
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.060] not
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.340] only
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:01.520] do
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:01.660] our
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:02.080] uses
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.440] have
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:02.560] to
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:02.840] become
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.040] more
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:03.380] efficient,
[00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.490] we
[00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.730] also
[00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:05.130] have
[00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:05.310] to
[00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.710] simply
[00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:06.910] reduce
[00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:07.250] the

[00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.870] we're
[00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:08.210] using,
[00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.770] and
[00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:08.870] the

[00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.130] has
[00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.250] to
[00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.450] become
[00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:10.750] renewable,
[00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:10.990] so
[00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.090] we
[00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.250] actually
[00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:11.550] need
[00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:11.730] a
[00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.050] complete

[00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.830] If
[00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.990] you
[00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.330] look
[00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.010] at

[00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.330] want

[00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.350] we
[00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.550] actually
[00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:04.950] need
[00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:05.270] to

[00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.530] we
[00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:10.650] may
[00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:10.790] have
[00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:10.890] to
[00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:11.310] hire
[00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.590] some
[00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.730] of

[00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.650] This
[00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.010] is
[00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:17.670] part
[00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:17.770] of
[00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:17.950] the

[00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:18.710] This
[00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.830] is
[00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.010] why
[00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.150] you
[00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:19.370] have
[00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.890] activists
[00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:20.210] trying

[00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:23.770] and
[00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:24.070] avoid
[00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.370] building
[00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:24.570] new
[00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:25.090] pipelines

[00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:26.270] plants
[00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:27.130] or
[00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:27.450] having
[00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:27.690] to
[00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:27.850] pass
[00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:27.950] on,
[00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:28.110] let's
[00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.310] say,
[00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:28.970] gas
[00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:29.330] bans
[00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:29.510] for
[00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.670] new
[00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.190] appliances
[00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:30.990] in
[00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.270] parts
[00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:31.370] of
[00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.910] Massachusetts

[00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:33.630] states.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:34.640] So
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:34.820] just
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:34.960] to
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.180] show
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:35.300] you
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:35.420] what
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:35.560] this
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:35.760] looks
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.040] like,
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:36.500] all

[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.220] have

[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:53.560] And
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:53.620] you
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:53.720] can
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:53.840] see

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.360] overwhelmingly
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:56.880] dominated

[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:01.720] buildings
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:01.840] are
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.060] actually
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:02.260] relatively
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:02.780] small.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:03.660] And
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:03.860] those
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.000] are
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.220] all
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:04.460] things
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:04.600] that
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:04.680] are
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:04.740] going
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:04.860] to
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.160] phase
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.360] out
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:05.860] naturally
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.120] over
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:06.540] time
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.180] because
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:07.600] infrastructure
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.080] gets
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:08.400] old.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:08.680] If
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:08.800] you
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.020] don't
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:09.280] maintain
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:09.620] it
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:09.820] and
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:09.960] you
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.100] don't

[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:10.740] it,
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:11.580] then
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.160] it
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:12.380] wears
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:12.700] out
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:12.960] and

[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:13.840] anymore.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:14.280] We

[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.300] Do

[00:33:59.640 --> 00:33:59.880] actually
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.320] changes
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:00.520] how
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:00.780] people
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.460] subsequently

[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:03.180] And
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:03.340] there's
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:03.580] this

[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:03.860] of
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.140] fundamental

[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:08.860] I
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:09.120] suspect
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:09.760] if
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:09.880] we
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.120] measured
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:10.480] these

[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.320] ways,
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:11.680] you'd
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.040] find
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:12.500] different
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:12.880] places
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.000] are
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.500] responsible
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.240] for
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:14.580] different

[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.100] and

[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:21.700] how
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.300] intensity
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:22.700] may
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:22.920] show

[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:06.540] And

[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.300] we
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:07.640] think
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:07.980] back

[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:11.280] I

[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:16.860] that
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:16.960] we
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.080] should
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:17.240] not
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:17.400] be
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:17.980] complacent
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:18.320] about
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:18.560] the
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:18.820] fact
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.080] that
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:19.260] we
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:19.560] think
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.180] we
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:20.740] have
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.180] relatively
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:21.560] low
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:21.860] per
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.040] capita

[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:22.700] in
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.040] cities.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.560] We
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:23.800] have
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:23.880] to
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:23.980] be
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:24.500] responsible
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:24.880] for
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.020] the
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:25.280] fact
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:25.680] that
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.040] energy
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.200] is
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:26.380] being
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:26.620] used
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.020] elsewhere
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:27.540] that
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:27.660] we
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.120] consume
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:28.420] in
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:28.600] the
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:28.900] form
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.300] of
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:29.860] fuels,
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:30.640] goods
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:30.800] and
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.240] services,
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.160] food,
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:32.620] and
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:32.740] we
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:33.160] export
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:33.340] our
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:33.540] waste
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.000] also.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:34.380] So
[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:34.580] that
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:34.760] is
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:34.900] the
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.220] place
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:35.700] where
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.040] cities
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:36.380] can
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:36.560] have
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:36.680] a
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:36.820] big
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:37.260] impact
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:37.520] on
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:37.760] greenhouse
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.040] gas
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.440] emissions.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.020] But
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:39.160] it
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:39.340] may
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:39.620] be
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:39.780] a
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:39.960] different
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.160] kind
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:40.240] of
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:40.620] efficiency.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:40.860] We
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.000] might
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:41.120] have
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:41.240] to
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:41.480] think
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:41.820] about
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.280] how
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:42.560] much
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:42.720] we
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.180] consume,
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.040] why
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:44.220] we
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:44.540] consume
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:44.980] energy,
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:45.600] and
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:45.700] how
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:45.800] do
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:45.900] we
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.040] do
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:46.160] it
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:46.320] more
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:46.700] efficiently
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.360] and
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:47.700] hopefully
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.100] ultimately
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:48.540] reduce
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:48.700] our
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.120] consumption
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:49.740] to
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:49.940] meet
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.100] our
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:50.740] decarbonization
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.160] goals.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:52.960] Finally,
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:53.180] I'll
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:53.380] just

[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:54.780] quickly
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:54.980] because
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.100] we'll
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:55.380] talk
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:55.560] about

[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:26.440] just
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:26.560] to

[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:27.420] there's

[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:34.540] may
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:34.700] be

[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:37.780] And
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:37.980] so,
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:38.160] you
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:38.280] know,
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:38.480] this
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:38.560] is

[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:38.940] question,
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:39.100] are
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:39.180] we
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:39.280] going
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:39.380] to
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:39.600] double
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:39.960] count?
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:40.620] In
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:40.900] some
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.360] cases,
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:41.840] cities
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.160] are,
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:42.620] actually
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:42.900] most
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.340] cases,
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:43.940] cities
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:44.280] are
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:44.900] more
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:45.240] ambitious
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:45.640] than
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:45.820] their
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.220] states.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.000] Cities
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.180] are
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:47.400] often
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:47.740] more
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.060] ambitious
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:48.680] than
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.100] national
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.580] governments.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.220] We
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:50.380] want
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:50.460] to
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:50.940] avoid
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.500] double
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:51.840] counting.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:52.440] We
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:52.580] want
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:52.660] to
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.060] assume,
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:53.600] we
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:53.800] want
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.220] to
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:54.600] count
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.320] cities
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:56.960] considering
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.400] how
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:57.540] we're
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:57.640] going
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:57.740] to,
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:58.360] those
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:58.560] cities
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:58.720] are
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:58.880] going
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.020] to
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:36:59.280] act
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:36:59.540] relative
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:36:59.700] to
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:36:59.920] cities
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.080] without
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.580] targets.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:01.480] So
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:01.900] this
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:02.280] paper,
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:02.660] we'll
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:02.800] get
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:02.920] at
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.140] that.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:03.380] We'll
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:03.540] just
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:03.760] talk
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:03.960] about
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.160] more
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:04.260] in
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:04.660] class.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:05.480] And
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:05.620] this
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:05.840] brings
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.020] me
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.200] to
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:06.500] this
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.080] optional
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:07.560] reading
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:08.280] by
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.840] Markhoff

[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:09.300] al,
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:09.840] which
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.020] is
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:10.460] pledges
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:10.640] and
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.180] progress.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.120] This
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:12.260] is
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:12.420] a

[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.060] Institution
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:13.600] report.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.020] It
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:14.160] looks
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:14.300] at
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:14.400] the
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:14.620] 100

[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:15.580] across
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:15.680] the
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:15.840] United
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.220] States.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.180] They
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:17.740] find
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.260] that
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:18.840] number
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.040] of
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.340] cities,
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:19.720] these
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:19.920] 100
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.340] cities
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:20.620] have
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:20.940] all
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.360] set
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:21.820] fairly
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:22.180] ambitious
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:22.720] goals.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:23.740] Everything
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.260] on
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:24.560] the
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.120] blue
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:25.500] here,
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.140] on
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:26.280] the
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:26.560] right,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.100] the
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:27.440] parentheses
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:27.820] shows
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.100] you
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.440] when
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:28.620] they
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:28.820] set
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:28.980] the
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:29.240] goal.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:29.920] And
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.060] you
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.160] can
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:30.520] see
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.080] Boston
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:31.380] where
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:31.580] we
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:31.820] are.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:32.760] Actually,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.340] Cambridge
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:33.520] is
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:33.680] also
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:33.840] in
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:33.900] the
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.120] graph
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:34.560] somewhere,
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:35.360] but
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:35.760] Boston,
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.140] Massachusetts
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:36.400] in
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.040] 2005,
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:37.300] so
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:37.480] they're
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:37.580] going
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:37.640] to
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:37.800] have
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:37.940] an

[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:40.680] as
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:41.360] all
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:41.560] of
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:41.840] these
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.280] cities
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:42.620] did,
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:43.380] also
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:43.860] meeting
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.200] the

[00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:49.330] It's
[00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:49.730] commensurate
[00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.910] with
[00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:50.030] the

[00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:51.750] You
[00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.870] can
[00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:52.030] see
[00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.150] a

[00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.370] of

[00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:54.150] set
[00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.470] less

[00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:56.730] reduction,
[00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.330] let's
[00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:57.430] say
[00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.750] 40
[00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.970]%
[00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:58.430] reduction,
[00:37:58.930 --> 00:37:59.130] but
[00:37:59.130 --> 00:37:59.270] they
[00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.470] may
[00:37:59.470 --> 00:37:59.810] have

[00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:02.190] So
[00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.330] this
[00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:02.510] might
[00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.630] be

[00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:04.370] to

[00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.910] But

[00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:08.890] home
[00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:09.090] from

[00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:10.550] and

[00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:11.830] your
[00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:12.050] leisure,
[00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.270] because
[00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.390] I
[00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.530] think
[00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.710] some
[00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.790] of
[00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.850] you
[00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:13.270] will
[00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.390] be
[00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.650] quite
[00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:14.010] interested
[00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:14.290] in
[00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:14.610] particular
[00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:15.030] cities.
[00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.690] You
[00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:15.830] can
[00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:16.090] see
[00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:16.290] what
[00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:16.410] the
[00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:16.650] difference
[00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:16.850] is

[00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:17.290] their

[00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:20.330] And
[00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:20.470] you
[00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.610] can
[00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:20.810] see
[00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.930] in
[00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:21.030] the
[00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.310] case
[00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:21.550] of
[00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:22.010] Chicago,
[00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:22.530] Illinois,
[00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.450] they

[00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:28.210] They
[00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:28.310] had
[00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.410] a
[00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:28.730] target
[00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:29.110] emission
[00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:29.290] in

[00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:30.850] And
[00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:30.950] it
[00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:31.050] looks
[00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:31.250] like
[00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.790] Chicago's

[00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:35.270] 2015.
[00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.370] I
[00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:36.530] actually
[00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.750] find
[00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.870] this
[00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:37.230] report
[00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.550] quite
[00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.950] hopeful
[00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:38.610] because
[00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:38.770] it
[00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:39.090] takes
[00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:39.390] a
[00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.730] serious
[00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:39.950] look
[00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:40.050] at
[00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:40.190] all

[00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.610] cities
[00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:40.750] and
[00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:41.050] says,
[00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.370] well,
[00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:41.890] we
[00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:42.090] should
[00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:42.430] take
[00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:42.750] cities
[00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:43.230] seriously
[00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.670] in
[00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.910] terms
[00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:44.150] of
[00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.390] the

[00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:45.670] setting,
[00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:46.210] but
[00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:46.450] in
[00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:46.690] order
[00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:46.910] to
[00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:47.070] take
[00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:47.190] them
[00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.530] seriously,
[00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:47.770] we
[00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:47.990] also
[00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.230] have
[00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.390] to
[00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.710] hold
[00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.950] them
[00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:49.530] according
[00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:49.830] to

[00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:50.530] they're
[00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:50.810] setting.
[00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.530] So
[00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.790] it
[00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.930] looks
[00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:52.190] like
[00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.610] Boston
[00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:53.350] is
[00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:53.790] closer

[00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:02.810] us,
[00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:02.930] or
[00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:03.130] that

[00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:04.430] difference
[00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:05.090] gives
[00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:05.230] us
[00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.350] a
[00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:05.490] good

[00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.290] let's
[00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:08.430] say
[00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.650] Los
[00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:08.990] Angeles,
[00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.230] looks
[00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.390] like
[00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.510] it's
[00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.710] actually
[00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:10.030] ahead
[00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.130] of
[00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.250] its
[00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.510] goals.
[00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.690] It's
[00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:10.970] actually
[00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:11.650] 10

[00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:16.390] So
[00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:17.270] cities
[00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:18.050] looks

[00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:21.590] but
[00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:21.770] all
[00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:22.030] these
[00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.670] fairly
[00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:23.230] temperate

[00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.830] cities
[00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:24.030] are
[00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.250] doing
[00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:24.610] better
[00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:24.750] than
[00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.890] they
[00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:25.210] expected.
[00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:26.210] Some

[00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:27.450] here,
[00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.950] I
[00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:28.070] guess
[00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:28.510] Chicago
[00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.990] is
[00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.330] a
[00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:29.570] cold

[00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:30.150] city

[00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.650] Tucson
[00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:31.010] is
[00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:31.170] the
[00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:31.450] opposite,
[00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.190] but
[00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.350] for
[00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:32.630] different

[00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.490] Tucson
[00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:33.670] and
[00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:34.070] Chicago
[00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:34.730] are
