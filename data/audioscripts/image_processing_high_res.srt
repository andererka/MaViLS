[00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:03.650] Welcome
[00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.070] back
[00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.410] to
[00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.010] medical
[00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.570] engineering
[00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.370] and
[00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.730] today
[00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.970] we
[00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.170] want
[00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.310] to
[00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:07.690] continue
[00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.270] our
[00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.770] little
[00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.430] excursion
[00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.770] through
[00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.970] the
[00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.350] theory
[00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.010] but
[00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.290] you'll
[00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.530] see
[00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.810] that
[00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.070] we'll
[00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.250] get
[00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.530] much
[00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.730] more
[00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.210] applied
[00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.550] in
[00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:13.670] the
[00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.850] next
[00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.090] couple
[00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.250] of
[00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.570] videos
[00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.310] because
[00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.030] in
[00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.150] the
[00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.350] next
[00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.570] two
[00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.990] videos
[00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.250] we
[00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.490] want
[00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.630] to
[00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.930] talk
[00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.450] about
[00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.530] actual
[00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.810] 2d
[00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.950] signal
[00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.630] processing
[00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.410] and
[00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.590] the
[00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.830] first
[00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.090] thing
[00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.330] that
[00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.470] we
[00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.670] want
[00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.810] to
[00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.010] look
[00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.230] at
[00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.630] is
[00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.090] an
[00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.550] introduction
[00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.930] into
[00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:27.330] 2d
[00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.610] image
[00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.130] processing
[00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.050] and
[00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.290] we'll
[00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.670] start
[00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.270] with
[00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.610] simple
[00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.290] operations
[00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.870] and
[00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.290] expand
[00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.610] them
[00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:32.990] to
[00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.570] linear
[00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.090] systems
[00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.550] theory
[00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.090] and
[00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.490] filters
[00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.410] and
[00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.710] then
[00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.130] in
[00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.470] a
[00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.750] second
[00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.290] step
[00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.730] we
[00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.890] will
[00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.130] look
[00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.370] into
[00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.790] non
[00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.070]-linear
[00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.610] systems.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.640] So
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.900] I
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.160] hope
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.300] you
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.800] enjoy
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.400] the
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.800] 2d
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.200] image
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.700] processing
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.020] with
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.240] me.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.580] So
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.880] here
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.040] we
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.180] are
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.420] with
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.660] the
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.020] medical
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.580] engineering
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.220] systems
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.760] and
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.200] today
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.700] the
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.160] topic
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.400] will
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.640] be
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.080] image
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.680] processing.
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.840] So
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.160] let's
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.340] have
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.460] a
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.660] look
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.860] at
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.160] the
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.640] basics
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.860] of
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.120] image
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.680] processing.
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.100] Now
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.140] an
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.760] image
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.340] is
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.980] essentially
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.640] a
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.280] 2d
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.820] function
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.440] and
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.580] you
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.780] can
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.060] think
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.360] of
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.760] the
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.240] image
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.540] as
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.700] a
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.060] function
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.400] that
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.940] essentially
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.780] is
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.040] on
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.180] a
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.460] grid
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.000] space
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.560] where
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.700] you
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.900] could
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.160] say
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.580] essentially
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.020] every
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.480] column
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.860] and
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.180] every
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.540] row
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.020] is
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.400] a
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.780] function
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.180] or
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.440] a
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.720] signal
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.480] as
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.800] we've
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.240] discussed
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.700] earlier
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.340] and
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.500] now
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.660] we
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.860] have
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.020] to
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.500] expand
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.740] this
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.160] space
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.660] and
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.760] to
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.960] be
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.300] able
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.760] to
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.040] work
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.260] with
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.520] these
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.180] 2d
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.760] signals.
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.620] Here
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.720] on
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.840] the
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.020] right
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.200] hand
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.420] side
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.600] you
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.820] see
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.960] a
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.500] visualization
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.500] and
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.660] you
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.860] can
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.120] see
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.480] here
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.780] that
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.000] we
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.380] have
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.000] the
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.240] red
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.780] function
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.540] which
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.760] is
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.320] essentially
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.920] one
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.340] column
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.020] and
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.400] this
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.560] is
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.740] a
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.040] sequence
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.380] of
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.880] values
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.260] that
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.400] you
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.600] can
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.860] see
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.160] here
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.500] plotted
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.620] and
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.900] we
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.180] also
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.360] have
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.500] the
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.700] blue
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.140] function
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.520] which
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.660] is
[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.040] essentially
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.340] one
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.720] row
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.000] and
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.180] it's
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.460] again
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.700] a
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.040] sequence
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.240] of
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.780] values.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.280] Together
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.900] these
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.500] gray
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.920] values
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.140] here
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.240] in
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.400] this
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.840] example
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.680] form
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.080] a
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.380] 2d
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.820] image.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.040] Now
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.260] you
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.540] see
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.840] the
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.160] lady
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.580] here
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.400] that
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.920] is
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.420] actually
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.860] Lena
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.280] and
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.500] this
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.660] is
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.920] one
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.160] of
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.400] the
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.740] first
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.300] images
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.940] that
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.160] was
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.420] used
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.620] for
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.840] image
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.400] processing.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.220] It
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.720] actually
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.820] originates
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.320] from
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.720] a
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.120] magazine
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.960] that
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.200] was
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.600] published
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.000] in
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.800] November
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.220] 1972.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.060] So
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.320] at
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.560] that
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.040] time
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.780] there
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.020] were
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.560] not
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.800] so
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.260] many
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.020] scanners
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.340] and
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.680] digital
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.140] images
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.700] available.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.380] It
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.860] happened
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.300] that
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.680] one
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.980] of
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.520] those
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.180] images
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.800] were
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.340] scanned
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.600] so
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.840] they
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.100] took
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.400] a
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.080] subsection
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.300] of
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.460] one
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.580] of
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.720] the
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.140] largest
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.640] images
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.020] that
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.220] they
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.420] could
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.800] find
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.980] in
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.100] the
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.560] magazine.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.240] They
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.700] scanned
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.980] it
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.780] and
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.360] actually
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.300] this
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.640] image
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.160] became
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.540] kind
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.720] of
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.140] iconic
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.460] and
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.680] has
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.900] been
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.320] used
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.600] in
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.900] image
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.440] processing
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.940] over
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.200] and
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.440] over
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.860] again.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.840] So
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.380] Lena
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.820] became
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.340] extremely
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.820] popular
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.540] and
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.820] she
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.120] has
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.440] also
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.700] been
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.260] invited
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.300] although
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.720] she
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.060] didn't
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.360] know
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.860] about
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.200] her
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.720] fans
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.900] in
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.000] the
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.220] image
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.700] processing
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.400] community.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.060] So
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.420] she
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.560] has
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.700] been
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.100] invited
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.480] actually
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.800] to
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.100] a
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.320] couple
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.500] of
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.100] conferences
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.040] and
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.460] she
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.980] is
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.480] still
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.240] being
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.800] welcomed
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.380] warm
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.880]-heartedly
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.600] on
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.160] various
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.840] conferences
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.940] and
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.620] today
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.180] people
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.640] still
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.140] use
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.500] this
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.880] image
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.520] in
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.820] order
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.260] to
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.560] test
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.760] their
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.220] algorithms.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.020] Well
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.400] actually
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.960] there's
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.560] many
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.980] other
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.320] image
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.640] sets
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.880] that
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.140] people
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.620] experiment
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.000] with
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.360] now
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.780] but
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.900] sometimes
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.480] for
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.080] nostalgic
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.640] reasons
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.340] this
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.620] image
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.760] is
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.000] still
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.220] being
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.640] used.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.540] Note
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.820] that
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.260] only
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.760] this
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.620] subsection
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.940] that
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.080] we
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.200] are
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.500] showing
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.880] here
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.100] is
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.380] being
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.760] used
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.180] and
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.480] the
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.780] full
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.180] image
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.140] is
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.120] not
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.720] being
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.200] commonly
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.720] used
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.380] in
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.700] the
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.920] image
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.400] processing
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.360] community.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.160] So
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.640] just
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.840] that
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.960] you
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.280] don't
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.560] get
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.060] the
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.300] wrong
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.800] impression
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.340] it
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.540] was
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.860] just
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.120] one
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.260] of
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.400] the
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.680] images
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.100] that
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.340] was
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.620] lying
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.960] around
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.380] and
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.840] that
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.000] they
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.180] had
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.540] access
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.840] to
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.480] and
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.680] they
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.120] decided
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.380] to
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.600] use
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.820] this
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.300] subsection
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.500] of
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.660] the
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.920] image.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.260] What's
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.640] the
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.960] digital
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.400] image?
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.660] So
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.940] let's
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:05.100] go
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.400] back
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.580] and
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.800] think
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.940] of
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.140] our
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.520] function
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.980] space
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.200] and
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.400] what
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.540] you
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.740] can
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.020] see
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.380] here
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.960] is
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.900] a
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.980] highly
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.060] magnified
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.560] image.
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.820] So
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.100] this
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.440] is
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.120] just
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.480] showing
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.660] a
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.880] couple
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.380] of
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.960] black
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.380] and
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.660] gray
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.060] dots
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.980] and
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.440] what
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.580] you
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.960] see
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.380] here
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.800] is
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.160] that
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.820] essentially
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.340] every
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.800] color,
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.620] every
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.200] shade
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.440] of
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.800] gray
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.240] is
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.880] associated
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.300] to
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.460] a
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.820] value.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.560] So
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.740] the
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.100] gray
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.340] that
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.500] you
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.700] can
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.980] see
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.340] here
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.580] it's
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.700] a
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.940] light
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.220] gray
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.460] so
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.660] it's
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.120] associated
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.440] to
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.580] the
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.800] value
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.280] 200
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.080] and
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.320] the
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.900] dark
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.300] color
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.500] the
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.860] black
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.100] is
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.640] associated
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.080] in
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.300] this
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.680] example
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.940] to
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.120] the
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.380] color
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.280] 35.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.780] So
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.620] essentially
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.280] every
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.620] shade
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.800] of
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.120] gray
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.460] is
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.920] associated
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.400] to
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.580] a
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.940] number
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.720] and
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.040] this
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.540] number
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.520] originated
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.300] from
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.760] a
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.100] sampling
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.560] process
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.260] as
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.400] we
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.880] discussed
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.320] in
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.420] the
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.640] last
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.920] video.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.160] Obviously
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.900] these
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.060] are
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.200] the
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.500] images
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.120] that
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.960] are
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.420] used
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.640] to
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.040] introduce
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.500] image
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.040] processing.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.540] What
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.740] we
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.960] will
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.280] work
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.560] with
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.000] much
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.220] more
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.720] frequently
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.400] are
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.580] of
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.780] course
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.320] medical
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.840] images
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.940] and
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.460] one
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.820] thing
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.080] that
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.240] is
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.620] very
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.420] peculiar
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.400] about
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.080] medical
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.520] images
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.060] is
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.640] that
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.860] they
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.340] often
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.660] have
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.080] more
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.440] gray
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.920] values,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.280] more
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.540] shades
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.720] of
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.940] gray,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.480] that
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.640] you
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.840] can
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.280] actually
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.780] show
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.080] at
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.280] the
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.500] same
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.880] time
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.140] on
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.320] your
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.720] monitor
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.500] and
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.940] actually
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.520] more
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.820] than
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.980] you
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.240] can
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.900] perceive.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.010] So
[00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.650] the
[00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.010] human
[00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.430] visual
[00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.110] system
[00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.690] can
[00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.550] approximately
[00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.610] differentiate
[00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.270] 256
[00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.350] different
[00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.670] shades
[00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.870] of
[00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.110] gray.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.800] You
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.180] cannot
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.780] differentiate
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.400] more
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.700] or
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.960] the
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.320] average
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.620] human
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.900] being
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.200] cannot
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.660] differentiate
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.160] more
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.420] and
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.580] if
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.680] you
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.140] display
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.440] them
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.880] you
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.060] will
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.320] see
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.560] that
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.780] they
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.320] appear
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.220] as
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.600] a
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.180] continuous
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.580] color
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.080] gradient
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.460] or
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.800] gray
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.700] value
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.260] gradient
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.620] on
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.800] your
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.160] screen.
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.760] So
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.100] in
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.440] order
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.700] to
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.900] be
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.200] able

[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.080] that
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.260] is
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.500] in
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.640] the
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.980] medical
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.520] image
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.960] we
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.160] have
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.300] to
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.540] use
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.920] tricks.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.060] One
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.380] trick
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.740] that
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.860] you
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.040] could
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.300] come
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.540] up
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.740] with
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.320] is
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.660] using
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.120] different
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.460] gamma
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.000] values
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.260] and
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.400] you
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.540] see
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.740] them
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.140] here.
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.700] We
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.880] can
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.100] do
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.380] a
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.660] gamma

[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.520] which
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.680] is

[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.700] and
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.100] if
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.340] we
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.560] would
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.800] do
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.120] so
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.640] we
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.920] would
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.120] be

[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.100] or
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.560] on
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.720] the

[00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.430] This
[00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.830] however
[00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.570] is
[00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.910] not

[00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.590] frequently

[00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.890] What
[00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.070] is
[00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.330] much

[00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.890] So
[00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:24.250] here
[00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.470] we
[00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.710] have
[00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.890] an

[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.700] So

[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.100] and
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.220] you
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.400] have
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:50.600] to
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.940] know
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.480] about
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.060] the
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.520] problems
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:52.780] that
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:52.980] can
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:53.440] arise
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.640] in
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:53.780] the
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:54.000] scanning
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.480] process
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.920] in
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.320] order
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.700] not
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:55.940] to
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.580] misread
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.100] the
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.600] information
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.000] here.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:58.680] So
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.000] for
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.300] sure
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.640] there
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:07:59.920] is
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.280] no
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.080] ring
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.560] like
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.080] bone
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.720] structure
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.440] at
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.640] the
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:03.900] bottom
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.360] of
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:04.600] the
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:04.920] scan
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.280] here
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.760] but
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.020] this
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.340] is
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.160] artificially
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.100] created
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.460] by
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:08.620] the
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.040] reconstruction
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.580] method
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.500] and
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.000] if
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.200] you're
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.480] reading
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:11.800] these
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.140] images
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.380] if
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:12.560] you're
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:12.980] interpreting
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.260] these
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:13.540] images
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:13.800] you
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:13.980] have
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.140] to
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.400] know
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:14.740] about
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.120] this.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.260] Obviously
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:16.660] there
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.000] is
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.380] a
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:17.720] wide
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.320] range
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:18.560] of
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.000] variations
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.340] that
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:19.460] you
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:19.620] can
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:19.860] pick
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.260] for
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:20.760] windowing
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:20.920] and
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.560] thresholding
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.480] and
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.060] this
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.280] is
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:23.640] why
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.200] I
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.400] have
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:24.560] a
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:24.840] short
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.260] video
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:25.540] where
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:25.660] we
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:25.780] are
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.140] playing
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:26.560] with
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:26.720] the
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.020] window
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:27.220] and
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:27.640] threshold
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.600] in
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.480] different
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:29.980] settings.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.840] So
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.080] what
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.240] you
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.660] see
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.240] is
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.840] that
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.500] the
[00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:07.530] image
[00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:07.890] is
[00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:08.210] actually
[00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:08.790] composed
[00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.430] of
[00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.050] different
[00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:10.470] gray
[00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.170] values.
[00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:12.170] Now
[00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.370] what
[00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:12.510] I'm
[00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:12.810] showing
[00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.210] here
[00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:13.530] is
[00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:13.950] called
[00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.590] a
[00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.050] histogram
[00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.190] and
[00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.350] a
[00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.710] histogram
[00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.350] is
[00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.310] essentially
[00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.130] a
[00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.370] kind
[00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.490] of
[00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.230] probability
[00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.010] distribution
[00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:21.490] because
[00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:21.870] you
[00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.470] count
[00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.970] the
[00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.530] frequency
[00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.050] the
[00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.730] occurrence
[00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.410] of
[00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:25.830] every
[00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.190] gray
[00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:26.630] value.
[00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:27.830] So
[00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.310] on
[00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.470] the
[00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.690] left
[00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:28.870] hand
[00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.050] side
[00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:29.550] example
[00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.190] we
[00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.430] have
[00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.810] gray
[00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.350] values
[00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.870] from
[00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.330] zero
[00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.110] to
[00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.010] 255
[00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.630] so
[00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.470] 256
[00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.170] different
[00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:37.650] shades
[00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:37.850] of
[00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:38.090] gray
[00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.050] and
[00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.350] you
[00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.590] can
[00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.990] see
[00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.550] on
[00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.150] the
[00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.570] y
[00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.070]-axis
[00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.770] how
[00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:43.350] often
[00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.710] that
[00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.890] how
[00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.690] often
[00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.030] that
[00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.610] respective
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:47.750] color
[00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:48.350] or
[00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.630] gray
[00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.070] value
[00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.210] appeared
[00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.790] in
[00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.030] the
[00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.410] image.
[00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.390] So
[00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:52.650] the
[00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.090] histogram
[00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.070] doesn't
[00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.570] contain
[00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:54.790] the
[00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.130] spatial
[00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.710] information
[00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.190] anymore
[00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.030] but
[00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.290] it
[00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.650] tells
[00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.970] you
[00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:58.810] which
[00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:59.610] gray
[00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:00.030] value
[00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.830] occurs
[00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:01.250] how
[00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.810] frequently.
[00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.410] Now
[00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.610] if
[00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:03.770] we
[00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.230] change
[00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.430] the
[00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.690] window
[00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:04.930] and
[00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:05.270] level
[00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:05.690] what
[00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.930] we're
[00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:06.390] essentially
[00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:06.850] doing
[00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:07.310] is
[00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.990] we're
[00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.610] adjusting
[00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.150] the
[00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.530] histogram
[00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.550] and
[00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.830] here
[00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:12.030] on
[00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.190] the
[00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.430] right
[00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.630] hand
[00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.950] side
[00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:13.250] you
[00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.470] can
[00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.750] see
[00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.090] a
[00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.790] rescaling
[00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:15.170] of
[00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.390] the
[00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:15.750] same
[00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.270] histogram
[00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.150] to
[00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.590] only
[00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.270] 16
[00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:18.810] bins.
[00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.890] So
[00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:20.230] here
[00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.570] we
[00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.990] have
[00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.990] pooled
[00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.970] neighboring
[00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:23.350] gray
[00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.990] values
[00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.630] in
[00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.890] order
[00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.190] to
[00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.630] reduce
[00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.010] the
[00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.290] number
[00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:26.510] of
[00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:26.730] gray
[00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.210] values
[00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:27.610] in
[00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:27.810] that
[00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.270] particular
[00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:28.670] image.
[00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.190] Obviously
[00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.630] this
[00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.830] would
[00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.090] have
[00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:31.250] a
[00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.490] large
[00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.030] impact
[00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.450] on
[00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:32.630] the
[00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.990] displayed
[00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.390] image
[00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:33.870] and
[00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.530] you
[00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:34.850] could
[00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.530] immediately
[00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.110] see
[00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.690] that
[00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:36.950] I
[00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:37.670] adjusted
[00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.950] the
[00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:38.190] number
[00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.390] of
[00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:38.550] gray
[00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.990] values.
[00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.610] So
[00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:39.810] this
[00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:39.950] is
[00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.290] something
[00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.250] that
[00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:41.670] we
[00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.910] won't
[00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.030] do
[00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.150] in
[00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.270] the
[00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:42.510] following.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:43.980] Now
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.260] let's
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:44.380] go
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:44.620] back
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:44.780] to
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.000] our
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.380] example
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:45.780] image.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:46.520] So
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:46.940] here
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.280] you
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.560] see
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:47.900] our
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.320] famous
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:48.720] Lenner
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.660] and
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.080] if
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.200] you
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.440] look
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:50.620] at
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:50.800] the
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.260] associated
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:51.820] histogram
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.140] here
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:52.280] on
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:52.420] the
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:52.640] right
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:52.840] hand
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.140] side
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:53.660] you
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:53.960] see
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.300] that
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:54.920] actually
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.280] not
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.740] all
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:55.960] of
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.120] the
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.020] 256
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.080] gray
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.620] values
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.400] actually
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.040] appear
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.320] in
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:00.440] the
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:00.780] image.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:01.680] So
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:01.920] you
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.160] see
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.400] that
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:02.640] there
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.040] is
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.240] a
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:03.540] short
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:03.960] area
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.680] with
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.060] very
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:05.900] low
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.140] gray
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:06.580] values
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:06.860] and
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.120] very
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:07.540] high
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:07.780] gray
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.220] values
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:08.480] where
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:08.720] the
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.220] frequency
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:09.560] is
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:09.880] zero.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:10.280] So
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:10.480] they
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:10.860] never
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.300] appear
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:11.540] in
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:11.680] the
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.000] image.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.260] And
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:13.620] you
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:13.840] can
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.220] see
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.800] also
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.360] that
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:15.860] our
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.400] Lenner,
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:16.980] well
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.220] the
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:17.520] image
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:17.940] impression
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.420] is
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:18.900] kind
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.040] of
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.400] okay
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.260] but
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.060] she
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.440] could
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:21.820] use
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:21.980] a
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.140] little
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:22.420] bit
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:22.820] more
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.480] contrast
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:23.880] right.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.360] So
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:25.660] this
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.000] is
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.460] where
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.420] histogram
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.420] equalization
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:28.760] comes
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.020] in.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.680] In
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.060] histogram
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:30.920] equalization
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.660] the
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:32.080] idea
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.420] is
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:32.620] that
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:32.780] we
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:33.020] want
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.180] to
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.940] optimally
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:34.600] use
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.420] all
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:35.960] of
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.300] the
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.000] associated
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.340] gray
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:37.920] values.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.140] What
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.240] we
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:39.320] are
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:39.540] doing
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:39.900] here
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.240] is
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.480] we
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:40.580] are
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:40.820] showing
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.100] the
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.540] cumulative
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.520] density
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.020] function
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:43.780] which
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.120] means
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.360] that
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:44.560] we're
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.020] essentially
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.720] computing
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.300] the
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:46.800] integral
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800] over
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.380] the
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:48.800] histogram.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.040] So
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.620] at
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:50.960] every
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.400] point
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:51.620] in
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:51.780] the
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.140] cumulative
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:52.900] density
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.320] function
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.080] I
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.240] am
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.700] showing
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.700] the
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.620] addition
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.260] of
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:57.640] all
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:57.820] the
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.340] values
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.180] from
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:11:59.860] the
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.280] zeroth
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:00.560] bin
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.040] to
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.260] the
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:01.540] current
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:01.820] bin.
[00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:02.890] So
[00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:03.090] this
[00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:03.310] can
[00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.510] be
[00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:03.990] computed
[00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.790] essentially
[00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.290] with
[00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:05.670] a
[00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.970] for
[00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:06.330] loop
[00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:06.890] where
[00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:07.050] you
[00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.390] then
[00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.190] add
[00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.630] up
[00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.150] all
[00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.350] of
[00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.510] the
[00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:09.870] previous
[00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.410] values
[00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:10.810] and
[00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:11.090] write
[00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.310] them
[00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.550] into
[00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:11.750] the
[00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.130] respective
[00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.490] bin.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.300] Now
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:14.740] if
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.120] I
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.160] normalize
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.480] this
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:16.740] with
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:16.940] the
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:17.220] total
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:17.580] number
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:17.780] of
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.300] pixels
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:18.940] in
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.140] the
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.560] image
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.040] you
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.220] will
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:20.460] see
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:20.680] that
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:20.820] we
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.160] get
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.860] values
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.260] between
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:22.720] zero
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.180] and
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:23.480] one.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:24.880] If
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.000] you
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.280] look
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.860] at
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.160] the
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.400] left
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:26.600] hand

[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.240] image
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:27.460] you
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:27.760] see
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.040] the
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.500] cumulative
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.180] density
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.800] function
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.920] of
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.480] our
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.100] original
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.580] image.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:33.760] And
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:33.920] you
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.120] can
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.400] also
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:34.680] see
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:34.920] that
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.600] plateaus
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.060] at
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.200] the
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.420] very
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:36.760] low
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.360] values
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:37.660] and
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:37.860] at
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.000] the
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.200] very
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:38.480] high
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:38.940] values
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:39.300] where
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:39.500] we
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:39.760] don't
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.000] have
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.280] any
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.780] change
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.480] in
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:41.840] gray
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.260] values
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:42.620] anymore
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.060] because
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.720] these
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:43.960] gray
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.300] values
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:44.680] simply
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.020] do
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:45.300] not
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:45.920] occur
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.140] in
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.260] the
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:46.540] image.
[00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.590] Now
[00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.750] the
[00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.030] idea
[00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.230] of
[00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.650] histogram
[00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.550] equalization
[00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.390] is
[00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.030] that
[00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.150] you
[00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.730] transform
[00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.050] this
[00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:52.610] cumulative
[00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.470] density
[00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.010] function
[00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:54.730] on
[00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:54.930] the
[00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:55.250] left
[00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.730] into
[00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.950] the
[00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:56.210] one
[00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.450] on
[00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:56.610] the
[00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:56.990] right.
[00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.470] So
[00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.690] we
[00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:57.950] want
[00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:58.170] to
[00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.530] linearize
[00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.070] the
[00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:00.570] entire
[00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:01.230] cumulative
[00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.870] density
[00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.450] function
[00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:03.190] which
[00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.690] essentially
[00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.350] means
[00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.930] that
[00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:05.130] we
[00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:05.590] try
[00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.950] to
[00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:06.590] achieve
[00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.090] a
[00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.350] more
[00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.590] or
[00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.850] less
[00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:08.930] uniform
[00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:09.930] distribution
[00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.370] of
[00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:10.530] the
[00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:10.710] gray
[00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.210] values.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.660] There
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.020] is
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.920] algorithms
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.400] to
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:14.580] do
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:14.920] so
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.660] and
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.080] in
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.600] particular
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.020] they
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:17.280] then
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:17.940] introduce
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.880] small
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.480] gaps
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:19.800] in
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:19.940] the
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.360] histogram
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.300] such
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:21.920] that
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.660] all
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:22.980] of
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.280] the
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.680] gray
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.160] values
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.540] are
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:24.880] being
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.340] used.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:25.680] So
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:25.880] you
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.060] could
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:26.280] say
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.520] this
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:26.680] is
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:26.880] very
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.340] similar
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:27.920] to
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.160] what
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:28.320] we
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:28.440] are
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:28.900] achieving
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.580] when
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:29.760] we
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.200] apply
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.680] the
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:30.960] window
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.400] leveling.
[00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.090] Now
[00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:33.370] here
[00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:33.590] you
[00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.810] can
[00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:34.250] see
[00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.210] a
[00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.990] histogram
[00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.470] that
[00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.690] has
[00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:36.970] been
[00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:37.790] equalized
[00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.710] and
[00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.010] now
[00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:39.430] the
[00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.030] contrast
[00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.510] of
[00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:40.710] the
[00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.970] image
[00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:41.190] has
[00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:41.370] been
[00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:41.890] improved
[00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:42.250] and
[00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:42.370] you
[00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:42.570] can
[00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:42.850] see
[00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.110] that
[00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.430] our
[00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.970] lowest
[00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:44.270] gray
[00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:44.570] value
[00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:44.830] is
[00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:45.010] now
[00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:45.310] really
[00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.730] zero
[00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:46.430] and
[00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.670] the
[00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.030] highest
[00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.330] gray
[00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:47.670] value
[00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.010] is
[00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:48.350] really
[00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.850] 255.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.220] Let's
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:51.640] compare
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:51.880] the
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.120] two
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.500] images
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.200] and
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.400] here
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.540] you
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:53.740] can
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.100] clearly
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:54.420] see
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:54.660] that
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:54.820] the
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.040] right
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.220] hand
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:55.420] side
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:55.740] image
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.280] has
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:56.440] a
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:56.640] much
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:56.900] better
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.440] contrast
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:57.940] than
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.100] the
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:58.300] left
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:58.500] hand
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:58.680] side
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.080] image.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.200] Good
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:02.600] so
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.000] these
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.200] are
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:03.480] the
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:03.860] very
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.520] basics
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.080] of
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.360] image
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:05.880] processing
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.340] and
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:06.700] now
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.120] we
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:07.380] want
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:07.540] to
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:07.720] go
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.040] ahead
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.520] and
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:08.800] look
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.080] what
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:09.260] we
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:09.480] can
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:09.940] achieve
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.600] with
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.320] linear
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:11.780] systems
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.200] theory
[00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:13.330] and
[00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:13.570] one
[00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:13.890] thing
[00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:14.130] that
[00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.370] can
[00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:14.570] be
[00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:14.890] very
[00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.350] nicely
[00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.970] achieved
[00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:16.690] is
[00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.330] computing
[00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:17.970] derivatives.
[00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.450] Now
[00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:19.890] a
[00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:20.330] derivative
[00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:20.710] of
[00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.910] a
[00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.330] function
[00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:21.830] if
[00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:21.950] you
[00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:22.170] look
[00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:22.350] at
[00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.490] the

[00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:23.590] this
[00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.170] is
[00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.750] essentially
[00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.510] the

[00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.730] of
[00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.270] the

[00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.410] plus
[00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:28.570] a

[00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.170] at
[00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.330] the

[00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.650] x
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.000] and
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.560] then
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:33.760] you
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.060] subtract
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:34.660] the
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.460] original
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:35.940] value
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.180] at
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:36.500] position
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:36.800] x
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:36.980] from
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:37.220] that
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:37.520] and
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:37.940] divide
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.240] by
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:38.420] the
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:38.640] small
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.000] value
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.600] h.
[00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:41.330] If
[00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:41.450] you
[00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:41.770] now
[00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.070] have
[00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:42.290] the
[00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.690] limit
[00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.390] of
[00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:43.990] h
[00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.570] towards
[00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:44.990] zero
[00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.470] you
[00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.830] get
[00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:46.170] the
[00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:46.690] continuous
[00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.230] derivative.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:48.820] Now
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.000] the
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.360] problem
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:49.620] that
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:49.760] we
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.080] have
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.440] is
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:50.700] that
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:50.840] we
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:50.920] are
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.040] in
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.200] a
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.520] discrete
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.220] space.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:52.780] In
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:52.940] a
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.240] discrete
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:53.760] space
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.280] we
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:54.640] cannot
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.260] assign
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:55.800] values
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.060] of
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.440] h
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:56.780] that
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:56.960] are
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.180] lower
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:57.500] than
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:57.880] one
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.580] because
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.100] they
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:14:59.300] would
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:14:59.480] be
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:14:59.760] zero
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.080] and
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:00.340] then
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:00.980] our
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.280] whole
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:01.900] computation
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.280] would
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:02.580] simply
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.060] collapse
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:03.280] to
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:03.560] zero.
[00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.570] So
[00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:04.810] what
[00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:04.950] we
[00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:05.170] do
[00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:05.570] is
[00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:06.190] we
[00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:06.870] then
[00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.730] choose
[00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.150] different
[00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.750] variants
[00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.070] of
[00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:09.510] doing
[00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:09.770] a
[00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:10.130] single
[00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:10.490] a
[00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.730] step
[00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.990] size
[00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.210] of
[00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.490] one
[00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.090] and
[00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:12.250] then
[00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:12.390] you
[00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:12.650] come
[00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.910] up
[00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.290] with
[00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:13.470] the
[00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.870] solution
[00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:14.290] shown
[00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:14.550] here
[00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.730] at
[00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:14.870] the
[00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.130] bottom.
[00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:15.910] So
[00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.210] you
[00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:16.630] can
[00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.310] for
[00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.910] example
[00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.290] take
[00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:20.150] the
[00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.610] value
[00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:20.910] of
[00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:21.250] one
[00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:21.870] for
[00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:22.210] h
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.640] then
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:23.880] you
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.220] add
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:24.560] one
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:24.800] to
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:24.960] the
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.360] function
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:25.640] f
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:25.780] of
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.080] x
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:26.820] and
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.300] subtract
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.240] f
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.380] of
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:28.660] x
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:28.860] from
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.180] that.
[00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:30.230] This
[00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.410] would
[00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.550] be
[00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.750] the
[00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.030] forward
[00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.890] difference.
[00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.070] There
[00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:33.250] is
[00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:33.470] the
[00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.850] backward
[00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:34.510] difference
[00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:34.730] where
[00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.870] you
[00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:35.070] set
[00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:35.350] h
[00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.550] to
[00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:35.970] minus
[00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:36.290] one
[00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.510] so
[00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:36.650] you
[00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.010] subtract
[00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:37.450] one
[00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.230] then
[00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.830] the
[00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:39.150] two
[00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.630] flip
[00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.310] and
[00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.490] you
[00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.750] have
[00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.070] f
[00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:41.310] of
[00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:41.850] x
[00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:42.510] minus
[00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.170] f
[00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:43.410] of
[00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:43.690] x
[00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.030] minus
[00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.390] one.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:45.680] So
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:45.880] the
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.260] problem
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:46.540] with
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:46.800] those
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.000] two
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.440] approaches
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.020] is
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.440] that
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:48.720] you're
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.220] essentially
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:49.800] computing
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.060] the
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:50.520] derivative
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.220] at
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:51.620] the
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:52.140] position
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.260] x
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:53.680] plus
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:53.900] 0
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:54.640].5.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.460] So
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:55.960] you're
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.440] kind
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:56.600] of
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:56.960] shifting
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.220] the
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.580] coordinate
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.100] system
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:58.760] and
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:58.920] you
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.280] wouldn't
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:15:59.460] be
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:15:59.660] in
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:15:59.800] the
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.120] original
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:00.500] coordinate
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:00.940] system
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.360] which
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.680] is
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:01.960] the
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.240] reason
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:02.600] why
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.380] very
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:03.880] frequently
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.360] there's
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:04.620] also
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.180] central
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.780] differences
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:06.780] and
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:06.940] the
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.220] central
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:07.800] difference
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.060] then
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:08.400] simply
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:08.840] takes
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.100] the
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:09.420] pixel
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.300] on
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:10.840] the
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.120] right
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.320] hand
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:11.680] side
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.040] and
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.720] subtracts
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:12.880] the
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.140] pixel
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:13.460] on
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:13.600] the
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:13.780] left
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.000] hand
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.280] side
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:14.660] of
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:14.860] the
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.120] current
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.580] position
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:15.860] of
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.000] the
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.280] image.
[00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:17.870] This
[00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.010] is
[00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:18.410] interesting
[00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.790] because
[00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.070] it
[00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:19.410] allows
[00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:19.730] us
[00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.010] to
[00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:20.570] compute
[00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:21.690] image
[00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.310] derivatives.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:23.680] Now
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.120] why
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:24.400] would
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:24.620] we
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:24.940] be
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.440] interested
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:25.800] in
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.200] image
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:26.740] derivatives?
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:27.820] Well
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.060] let's
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.240] look
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.380] at
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:28.540] an
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:28.960] example
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.680] and
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:29.920] here
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.080] you
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.260] can
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:30.440] see
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:30.640] the
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.080] derivatives
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:31.780] in
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.200] x
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:32.740] and
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.000] y
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.500] direction
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.700] and
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:34.880] what
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.020] you
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:35.360] see
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:35.680] very
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.100] nicely
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.440] here
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:36.780] is
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.540] that
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.020] the
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:38.320] edges
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:38.620] pop
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.080] up.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:39.680] So
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.700] edges
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.620] in
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.240] our
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:42.800] image
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.440] are
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:43.980] locations
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.320] of
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:44.600] very
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:44.860] high
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.520] gradients.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.080] So
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.360] here
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:46.560] you
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:46.880] have
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.300] either
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:47.740] in
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.040] x
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:48.200] or
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:48.440] y
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.040] directions
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:49.660] very
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:49.900] high
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.380] derivatives.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.220] So
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:52.760] one
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.240] idea
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:53.480] for
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:53.880] example
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.140] to
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:54.720] detect
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.240] edges
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.040] is
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:56.260] to
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:56.640] compute
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:56.960] the
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.420] derivative
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:57.920] in
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.500] x
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:58.920] and
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.180] y
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:16:59.680] direction
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:00.860] and
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.080] then
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:01.660] compute
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.180] the
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:02.680] magnitude
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.060] of
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.200] the
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:03.420] two.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.080] So
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:04.500] because
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:04.740] you
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:04.860] have
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.020] a
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:05.240] two
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:05.680]-dimensional
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.180] function
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:06.980] you
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.200] will
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:07.740] be
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.100] introducing
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.540] a
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:09.980] gradient
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.600] that
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:10.740] is
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:10.980] also
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.260] two
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:11.640]-dimensional
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.000] because
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.280] you
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:12.580] compute
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:12.760] the
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.260] derivatives
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:13.640] in
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:13.880] x
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.000] and
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.220] y
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.660] direction
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.060] and
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.260] then
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:15.420] you
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:15.720] take
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.280] the
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:16.760] norm
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.080] for
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:17.580] example
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.480] the
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.000] L2
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.460] norm
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:19.780] of
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.000] this
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.380] gradient
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.120] and
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.380] this
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:21.640] way
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.120] you
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:22.360] can
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:22.760] determine
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.040] the
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.400] magnitude
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.280] and
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:24.660] detect
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.160] edges.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.200] Also
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:26.620] interesting
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.100] is
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:27.640] that
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:27.780] you
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.000] can
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.260] also
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:28.760] compute
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.360] the
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:29.900] direction
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.660] and
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:30.980] then
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.440] you
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:31.720] could
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.260] compute
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:32.580] the
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.140] angle
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.120] of
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.680] the
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.120] edges
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.620] which
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:35.860] then
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.240] allows
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:36.380] you
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:36.720] also
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:36.960] to
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.400] detect
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.340] edges
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:38.660] of
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:38.820] a
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.140] certain
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.840] orientation.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:41.560] So
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.420] this
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:42.580] is
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:42.800] a
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.180] very
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.440] very
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:43.860] common
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.560] application
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.300] for
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:45.740] linear
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.460] systems
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.520] and
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.160] a
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.380] good
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:48.760] way
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.200] of
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.380] how
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:49.580] we
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:49.780] can
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.300] actually
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.540] compute
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.540] edges
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:52.860] in
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.060] an
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.380] image.
[00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:55.670] This
[00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:55.990] brings
[00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.210] us
[00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.530] back
[00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:56.810] to
[00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:57.110] image
[00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.530] filtering
[00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:57.830] and
[00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:58.090] linear
[00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:58.530] systems
[00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:58.990] theory.
[00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.750] So
[00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:00.030] you
[00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:00.470] remember
[00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.910] that
[00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:01.210] a
[00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:01.530] filter
[00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.110] can
[00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.410] be
[00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:02.950] applied
[00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:03.310] to
[00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.490] an
[00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:03.810] image
[00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.930] and
[00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:05.370] this
[00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:05.830] filter
[00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:06.710] has
[00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:07.030] very
[00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:07.530] similar
[00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:08.130] properties
[00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:08.690] as
[00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.890] we
[00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:09.330] already
[00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:09.970] have
[00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:10.490] discussed
[00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.710] in
[00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.850] the
[00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:11.130] 1D
[00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:11.650] case.
[00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.250] So
[00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:12.490] the
[00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:12.850] filters
[00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:13.490] are
[00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.210] linear
[00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.970] and
[00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.150] they
[00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:15.310] are
[00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.650] shift
[00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:16.490] invariant.
[00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.610] So
[00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.550] this
[00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.710] is
[00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.050] a
[00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:20.250] linear
[00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:20.490] shift
[00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:20.990] invariant
[00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.470] system
[00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.050] which
[00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.790] means
[00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.230] that
[00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.370] it
[00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:23.570] can
[00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:23.750] be
[00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.330] entirely
[00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.050] described
[00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.890] by
[00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.850] convolution.
[00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:28.070] And
[00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.530] therefore
[00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:28.890] we
[00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:29.070] will
[00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.450] need
[00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.030] a
[00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:30.550] 2D
[00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.090] convolution
[00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.290] and
[00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:32.710] now
[00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.910] you
[00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.130] can
[00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:33.430] see
[00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.830] here
[00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:34.310] that
[00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.490] we
[00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.830] have
[00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.210] some
[00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:35.690] function
[00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:36.170] k
[00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.170] which
[00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:37.410] is
[00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:37.670] a
[00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:37.850] filter
[00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:38.470] kernel
[00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.530] and
[00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:39.770] the
[00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.030] filter
[00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:40.430] kernel
[00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.890] now
[00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.390] takes
[00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.810] the
[00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:42.710] role
[00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:43.070] of
[00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.370] the
[00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:43.890] impulse
[00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.530] response
[00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.110] that
[00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.270] we
[00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.570] talked
[00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:45.930] about
[00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:46.870] earlier
[00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.050] in
[00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:48.770] our
[00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.250] systems
[00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.750] theory.
[00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.590] So
[00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.890] now
[00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:51.130] we
[00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:51.390] have
[00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.750] suddenly
[00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.410] 2D
[00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:52.850] impulse
[00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:53.510] responses
[00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.330] and
[00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:54.830] these
[00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:55.350] can
[00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.690] be
[00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:56.190] written
[00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.490] up
[00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:56.750] in
[00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.910] a
[00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.350] discrete
[00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.790] fashion
[00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:58.110] and
[00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.270] then
[00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.470] we
[00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.730] end
[00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:59.030] up
[00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.430] with
[00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.690] filter
[00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.350] kernels.
[00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.890] For
[00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:02.190] some
[00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.710] functions
[00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:03.130] they
[00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:03.390] can
[00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.590] be
[00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:04.030] described
[00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:04.270] in
[00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:04.390] a
[00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.610] very
[00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.070] compact
[00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.450] way
[00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.190] such
[00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.850] as
[00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:07.090] for
[00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:07.310] the
[00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.830] derivative
[00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:08.650] we've
[00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:08.990] seen
[00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.270] that
[00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.610] every
[00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:10.350] point
[00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.550] of
[00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:10.730] the
[00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:11.090] image
[00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.310] we
[00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.670] essentially
[00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:11.910] have
[00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:12.070] to
[00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.310] take
[00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.730] the
[00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:12.970] left
[00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:13.310] neighbor
[00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.850] and
[00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.010] the
[00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.230] right
[00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.570] neighbor
[00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.250] subtract
[00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:15.610] the
[00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:15.790] two
[00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.030] from
[00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:16.210] each
[00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:16.450] other
[00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.230] and
[00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.530] then
[00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.030] we
[00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.330] get
[00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.230] exactly
[00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.070] the
[00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.630] derivative
[00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.390] in
[00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.590] that
[00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.970] particular
[00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:22.510] direction.
[00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.630] So
[00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.910] that's
[00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:24.370] interesting
[00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.450] because
[00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.230] we've
[00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.550] just
[00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.030] seen
[00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:27.550] that
[00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.030] computing
[00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:28.310] a
[00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.950] derivative
[00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:30.190] can
[00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.390] be
[00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.890] performed
[00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:31.430] by
[00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:32.030] convolution
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.400] and
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:33.900] for
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.260] a
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:34.700] derivative
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.420] we
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:35.700] can
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.240] determine
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:36.780] a
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.080] kernel
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.540] that
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:37.700] is
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:38.160] performing
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:38.860] the
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.300] derivative.
[00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.830] So
[00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.130] this
[00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.650] means
[00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:42.290] that
[00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:42.750] computing
[00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.330] derivatives
[00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.550] is
[00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.170] something
[00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:45.870] that
[00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:46.150] can
[00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.370] be
[00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.030] explained
[00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.790] by
[00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:48.330] a
[00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:48.690] linear
[00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:49.170] shift
[00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:49.830] invariant
[00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.290] system.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.260] So
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:51.620] that's
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:51.860] actually
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.180] pretty
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:52.540] useful
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:52.840] and
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:52.960] you
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.120] will
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.340] see
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:53.640] that
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.260] throughout
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:54.500] your
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:54.820] studies
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.120] this
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:55.300] will
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:55.520] have
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:55.860] many
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.160] many
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.760] applications
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.360] and
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:57.560] it's
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:57.800] also
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.060] very
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:58.400] useful
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:58.760] for
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.140] example
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:19:59.440] for
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:19:59.820] solving
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.480] partial

[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.720] equations.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.120] So
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.760] you
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:03.940] will
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.220] see
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:04.540] this
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:04.820] will
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.320] come
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:05.660] up
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.340] over
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:06.700] and
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:06.920] over
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.360] again
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:07.740] in
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:07.900] your
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.320] studies.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.280] Here
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:09.520] we
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:09.700] will
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.020] now
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:10.500] only
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:10.980] stick
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:11.420] to
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:11.600] the
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.000] discrete
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.440] version
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:12.960] and
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.160] the
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:13.360] nice
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:13.620] thing
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:13.780] with
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:13.940] the
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.300] discrete
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:14.640] version
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.000] is
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.780] that
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.180] we
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:16.400] can
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.680] write
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:16.940] these
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.160] up
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:17.480] as
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:17.680] these
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.020] filter
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.580] kernels
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.140] and
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:19.280] you
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:19.420] will
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:19.640] see
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:19.880] that
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.120] this
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.440] then
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:20.800] takes
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.000] the
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.240] form
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:21.720] of

[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:23.620] for
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.060] several

[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:24.980] such
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.240] as
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:25.460] the
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:25.820] derivative
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.360] filter.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.180] A

[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.480] apply
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.100] which
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:36.700] means
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.520] that
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.240] if
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:38.620] you
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.260] have
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:39.500] a
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:39.780] filter
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.240] kernel
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:40.940] and
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.200] you
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.020] convert
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:42.280] it
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:42.680] into
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.180] Fourier
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.600] domain
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.540] and
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:44.660] you
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:44.800] have
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:44.960] the
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.260] image
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:45.440] and
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:45.580] you
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:45.920] convert
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.120] it
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:46.260] to

[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.620] domain
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.220] then
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:48.400] you
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:48.700] just
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:48.880] have
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.060] to
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.640] multiply
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:49.980] the
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.360] two
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.740] pointwise
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.260] and
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:52.660] convert
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.100] back
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:53.460] and
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:53.600] you
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:53.860] do
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.500] exactly
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:54.840] a
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.260] convolution.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:56.380] Now
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:56.560] for
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:56.760] the
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.080] simple
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:57.620] filters
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:57.960] that
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.100] we
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:58.360] have
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:58.740] here
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.120] in
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:20:59.380] this
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:20:59.580] set
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:20:59.720] of
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.160] slides
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.120] this
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.320] would
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:01.760] be
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.320] rather
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:02.780] excessive
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.280] because
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:03.820] typically
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.360] the
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:04.720] kernels
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:04.860] are
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.100] very
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.460] small
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:05.740] they
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:05.920] are
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.240] like
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.100] one
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:07.280] by
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:07.680] three
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.020] or
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:08.200] three
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:08.380] by
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:08.640] three
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:08.820] or
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.020] five
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.180] by
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:09.540] five.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.120] These
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:10.340] are
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.080] really
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:11.920] compact
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.320] kernels
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:12.500] and
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:12.700] there
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:12.840] it
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.080] doesn't
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.260] make
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:13.560] sense
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.060] to
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:14.480] compute
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:14.700] the
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.060] complete
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:15.340] Fourier
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:15.780] transform
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.440] but
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:16.840] sometimes
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.060] you
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:17.240] have
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:17.660] kernels
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:17.940] with
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.440] very
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:18.860] large
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.340] extent
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:19.820] in
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.540] spatial
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:20.960] domain
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.640] and
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:21.960] there
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.280] it
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:22.560] makes
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:22.860] sense
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.080] to
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.380] make
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:23.720] use
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:23.940] of
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.140] the
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:24.500] Fourier
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.080] properties
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.440] here.
[00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:27.170] Also
[00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:27.350] you
[00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.510] will
[00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.730] see
[00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:27.970] that
[00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.150] the
[00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:28.450] 2d
[00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:28.770] Fourier
[00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:29.150] space
[00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:29.670] is
[00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.050] something
[00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:30.670] that
[00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:30.990] comes
[00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.250] up
[00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.590] in
[00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.770] this
[00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:32.150] class
[00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:32.590] again
[00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.890] and
[00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:33.110] again.
[00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:34.950] Now
[00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:35.330] what's
[00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:35.710] actually
[00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.970] a
[00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:36.370] 2d
[00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:36.790] Fourier
[00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.310] space?
[00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.530] You
[00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.030] remember
[00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:39.510] that
[00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.690] when
[00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:39.850] we
[00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.010] are
[00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.430] computing
[00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.790] the
[00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.410] 1d
[00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:42.170] Fourier
[00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:42.810] transform
[00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:43.410] we
[00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:43.870] essentially
[00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:44.570] take
[00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.910] a
[00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:45.250] signal
[00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.030] of
[00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:46.430] a
[00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.710] fixed
[00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:47.250] frequency
[00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:48.310] and
[00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.670] then
[00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:49.150] we
[00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:49.830] multiply
[00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.330] it
[00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.770] pointwise
[00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:52.390] with
[00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.770] the
[00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:53.070] signal
[00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.330] that
[00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.470] we
[00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.630] want
[00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.790] to
[00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.370] process,
[00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.510] sum
[00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.890] everything
[00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:56.250] up
[00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:56.650] and
[00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:56.830] we
[00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.030] get
[00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:57.250] the
[00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:57.630] coefficient
[00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:58.250] for
[00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.610] that
[00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:59.090] particular
[00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.650] frequency.
[00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.040] Now
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:01.320] in
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:01.520] the
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:01.880] 2d
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.440] case
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.480] this
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:03.880] is
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.520] slightly
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.040] different
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.540] because
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:05.980] now
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.400] our
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.060] 2d
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.860] waves
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.900] have
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.100] to
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:09.280] be
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:09.800] described
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.240] also
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:10.480] in
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:10.980] 2d
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.560] which
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:11.940] means
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:12.440] that
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:12.940] it's
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.100] not
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:13.360] just
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:13.560] the
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.000] frequency
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.240] of
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:14.380] the
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:14.600] wave
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.260] but
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:15.440] they
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:15.740] also
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.100] have
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.540] an
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:16.920] orientation.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:17.640] So
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:17.920] they're
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.280] essentially
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:18.680] sine
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:18.880] and
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.240] cosine
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:19.700] wave
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.000] fronts
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.120] that
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:21.920] have
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.440] a
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:22.900] particular
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.500] orientation
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.080] and
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.280] you
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:24.520] can
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:24.880] see
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.260] that
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:25.880] they
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.140] are
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:26.700] printed
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.100] here
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:27.300] the
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:27.560] base
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.040] functions
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:28.900] on
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.520] the
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:29.780] set
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:29.940] of
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.400] slides
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:30.980] and
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.320] they
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:31.760] vary
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.080] in
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.800] orientation
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.940] and
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.380] in
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:34.860] frequency.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:35.140] So
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.280] the
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:35.700] frequency
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:35.980] you
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.180] can
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:36.560] determine
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:36.940] by
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.760] looking
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.280] essentially
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:38.960] from
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.300] one
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:39.560] valley
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:39.780] to
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:39.940] the
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.180] next
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:40.460] valley
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:40.700] so
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:40.940] that's
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.120] the
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:41.480] wavelength
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.280] and
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.500] this
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:42.660] is
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.240] associated
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:43.620] to
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.000] one
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.720] over
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:44.920] the
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.280] wavelength
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:45.580] will
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:45.760] give
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:45.880] you
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.020] the
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.480] frequency.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.000] So
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.640] what
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:48.780] you
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.020] see
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:49.180] in
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:49.360] this
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:49.640] image
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:49.940] now
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.340] is
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:50.560] that
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:50.720] we
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:50.940] can
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.420] compute
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:51.960] one
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.660] point
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.220] in
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:53.400] the
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:53.840] 2d
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.240] Fourier
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.900] transform
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.560] by
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.100] taking
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.000] one
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.240] of
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.440] the
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:57.740] wave
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.120] fronts
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.440] that
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:58.560] you
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:58.960] see
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.460] with
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.320] different
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.280] orientations
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.360] multiplying
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:02.880] the
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.320] entire

[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.440] pointwise
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.360] with
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:06.580] this
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:06.960] waveform
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.860] and
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:08.240] summing
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:08.620] everything
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:08.980] up.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:09.920] This
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.140] will
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:10.340] then
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:10.540] give
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:10.700] you
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.200] exactly
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:11.700] one
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.300] point

[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.120] Fourier
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.680] space.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:14.700] So
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.280] this
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:15.440] is
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:15.820] actually
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.400] quite
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:16.960] expensive
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.300] to
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:17.780] compute
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.640] because
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.100] we
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:19.320] have
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:19.680] to
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.660] instantiate
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:20.900] all

[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:21.700] fronts
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.340] then
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:22.580] we
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:22.880] have
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.160] to
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.800] multiply
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.120] them
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:24.820] pointwise
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.060] with
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:25.220] the
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:25.560] image
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.180] and
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:26.420] add
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:26.860] everything
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:27.120] up
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.280] and
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:27.440] then
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:27.560] you
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:27.840] just
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.040] got
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.360] one
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:28.820] point
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.140] in

[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.560] Also
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:31.880] see
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.200] that
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:32.560] the
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.020] farther
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:33.260] you
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:33.500] go
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:33.780] away
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.000] from
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.220] the

[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:38.540] the

[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.460] and

[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:40.460] you
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:40.680] get
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:40.820] to
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.020] the

[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.000] the
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.400] longer
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:42.660] the
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.100] wavelength
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.300] and
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:43.840] the
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.080] lower
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:44.360] the
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:44.840] frequency.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.040] Also
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.380] note
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:46.580] that
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:46.980] depending
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.320] on
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:47.520] the
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.200] orientation
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:48.640] the
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.160] direction
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:49.840] that
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.080] you're
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:50.420] at
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.260] the
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:51.760] orientation
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.260] of
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:52.420] the
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:52.620] wave
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:52.820] front
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:53.480] changes.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.620] Now
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.080] if
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.200] you
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:56.400] look
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:56.560] at
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:56.760] this
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.100] image
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:57.320] then
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:57.460] you
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:57.660] can
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.000] also
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.340] see
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:58.660] very
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.180] easily
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.320] that
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:00.840] if
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.000] you
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.200] would
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:01.420] be
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.380] rotating
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:02.760] the
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.140] image
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.340] then
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.040] essentially
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:05.560] you're
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:05.860] also
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:06.640] rotating
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.120] the
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:07.500] 2d
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:07.800] Fourier
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.400] space.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.100] So
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:09.380] if
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:09.520] you
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:09.740] have
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:09.920] a
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.440] rotation
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.600] in
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.280] the
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:12.580] spatial
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.040] domain
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:13.700] this
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.020] will
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.400] also
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:14.660] be
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:14.960] a
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.420] rotation
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:15.860] in
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.160] 2d
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:16.480] Fourier
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.060] space.
[00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.590] That's
[00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.790] quite
[00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.230] interesting
[00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.450] to
[00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:19.610] see
[00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.950] right?
[00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:20.510] So
[00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.830] keep
[00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:21.050] that
[00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:21.250] in
[00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:21.590] mind
[00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.050] if
[00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:22.170] you
[00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:22.350] want
[00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:22.470] to
[00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.650] go
[00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:22.850] to
[00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:23.150] Fourier
[00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:23.470] space
[00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:23.770] you
[00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:23.970] have
[00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:24.170] to
[00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:24.490] compute
[00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:24.790] those
[00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:25.010] wave
[00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.250] fronts
[00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.130] multiply
[00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:26.390] them
[00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.890] pointwise
[00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:27.110] with
[00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.290] each
[00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:27.510] other
[00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.770] and
[00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.910] add
[00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:28.110] them
[00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.350] up
[00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.130] and
[00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:29.290] if
[00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:29.410] you
[00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:29.570] want
[00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.690] to
[00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.830] go
[00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:30.170] back
[00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:30.790] it's
[00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:30.970] the
[00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:31.290] same
[00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:31.650] as
[00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:31.830] we
[00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.210] discussed
[00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.590] earlier.
[00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.130] So
[00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:33.290] you
[00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:33.590] take
[00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.810] the
[00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:34.190] coefficient
[00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.610] at
[00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.810] that
[00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:35.210] particular
[00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.670] point
[00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:36.150] in
[00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:36.290] the
[00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:36.590] 2d
[00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.930] Fourier
[00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:37.510] transform
[00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.070] you
[00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.890] multiply
[00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:39.550] this
[00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.030] with
[00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:40.210] the
[00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:40.710] complete
[00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.390] 2d
[00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.770] wave
[00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:42.050] front
[00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.210] and
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:43.640] then
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:43.860] you
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:44.240] repeat
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.500] that
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:44.760] for
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.260] all
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:45.540] of
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:45.740] the
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.240] points
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:46.560] in
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:46.680] the
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:46.980] 2d
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.240] Fourier
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:47.640] space
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.180] and
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:48.480] add
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:48.940] everything
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.300] up
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:49.880] and
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.160] this
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.440] way
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:50.880] you
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.200] get
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:51.780] the
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.440] original
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:52.880] image
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.380] again.
[00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.930] Okay
[00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:26.310] so
[00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.650] let's
[00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.010] return
[00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:27.250] to
[00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:27.550] our
[00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.030] example
[00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:28.910] and
[00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:29.230] now
[00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.550] let's
[00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:29.970] discuss
[00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:30.410] the
[00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:30.690] filter
[00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:31.050] kernel.
[00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:32.070] So
[00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.290] the
[00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:32.590] filter
[00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.990] kernel
[00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.410] here
[00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.410] for
[00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:34.810] the
[00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:35.290] derivative
[00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:35.810] filter
[00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:36.090] of
[00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:36.290] the
[00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:36.670] central
[00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:37.250] difference
[00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.770] is
[00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.210] simply
[00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.170] this
[00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:39.770] 3
[00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:40.010] by
[00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.330] 1
[00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.110] matrix.
[00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.770] So
[00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:41.950] you
[00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:42.270] simply
[00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:42.650] have
[00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:42.850] the
[00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.350] derivative
[00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.150] with
[00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:44.910] respect
[00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:45.230] to
[00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.650] x
[00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:46.050] written
[00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:46.330] up
[00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:46.590] here
[00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.830] so
[00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.990] you
[00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:47.250] take
[00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:47.630] minus
[00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.070] 1

[00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:49.790] f
[00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:50.150] of
[00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:50.850] x
[00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:51.170] minus
[00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:51.470] 1
[00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.830] y
[00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.730] plus
[00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:53.310] 0
[00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.810] times
[00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:54.130] f
[00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:54.250] of
[00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:54.450] x
[00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:54.710] y
[00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:55.190] plus
[00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.570] 1
[00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:55.990] time
[00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.830] f
[00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:56.990] of
[00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.210] x
[00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:57.430] plus
[00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.690] 1
[00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:58.030] y
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.980] and
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.240] this
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:25:59.460] is

[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.180] then
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:01.340] you
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:01.560] can
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:01.920] see

[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.040] this
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.300] and
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:58.560] think
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:58.940] about
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:27:59.420] how
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:27:59.660] the
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:27:59.900] shape
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.180] looks
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:00.480] like
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:00.680] you
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:00.860] can
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.120] see
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.380] that
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:01.640] this
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:01.820] is
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.000] a
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.400] discrete
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.100] approximation
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.380] of
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.100] a
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.560] Gaussian
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:05.980] bell
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.100] in
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.040] this
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:08.940] discrete
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.540] 5

[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:09.980] 5
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:10.440] neighborhood.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:12.380] Now
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:12.700] if
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:12.880] you
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.340] take
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:13.740] those
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.060] filter
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:14.720] kernels
[00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:16.110] and
[00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.570] apply
[00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:16.950] them
[00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:17.170] to
[00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:17.370] the
[00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:17.710] image
[00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:18.170] you
[00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:18.530] can
[00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:19.470] observe
[00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:19.710] the

[00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.730] both
[00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:20.950] the
[00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:21.170] mean
[00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:21.390] and
[00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:21.530] the
[00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:21.870] Gaussian
[00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:22.750] they
[00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.090] are
[00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.710] blur
[00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:24.210] filters
[00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:24.790] so
[00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:25.090] they
[00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:25.670] reduce
[00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:26.110] noise
[00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.590] but
[00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:27.510] also
[00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.230] reduce
[00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.510] the

[00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:29.390] of

[00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:29.830] image
[00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:30.310] so
[00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.490] you
[00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:30.690] can
[00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:30.990] take
[00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.170] the

[00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.650] on

[00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.530] side
[00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:33.090] and
[00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:33.550] produce
[00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:33.770] an

[00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.310] like

[00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:35.210] side
[00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.530] here.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.120] There
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:37.460] is
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:37.960] actually
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.460] many

[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.660] and

[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:41.460] also
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.000] prepared
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.600] a

[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.020] where
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:44.180] we
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:44.540] explore
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:44.780] the

[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:45.540] of

[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:52.920] and
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.180] I
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:53.440] think
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:53.720] this
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:53.880] is
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.200] something
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:54.940] that
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:55.080] you
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:55.420] can
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:56.120] very

[00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:58.920] that
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.020] we
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:28:59.100] are
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:28:59.360] also

[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.060] so
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:01.760] I
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:01.980] would
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.440] recommend

[00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.330] So
