[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.360] So
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.680] today
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.860] I
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:29.980] want
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.060] to
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.240] talk
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.360] with
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.460] you
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.840] about
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.740] how
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.860] it
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.060] is
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.160] that
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.240] we
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.380] can
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.720] do
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.640] research
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.940] of
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.060] a
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.340] scientific
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.740] kind
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.920] for
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.240] something
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.560] as
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.340] complex
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.540] as
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.780] human
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.260] behavior.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.280] As
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.580] opposed
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.720] to
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.960] things
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.080] that
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.200] you
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.420] measure
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.600] out
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.740] in
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.160] space,
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.320] or
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.600] test
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.000] tubes,
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.200] or
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.760] under
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.820] microscopes.
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.500] People
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.640] are
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.400] complex
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.100] organisms,
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.440] right?
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.740] And
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.900] so
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.000] to
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.220] do
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.680] research
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.880] on
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.980] them
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.120] to
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.720] understand
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.040] human
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.320] nature,
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.480] how
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.640] the
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.900] mind
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.180] works,
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.360] how
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.460] the
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.660] brain
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.060] supports
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.240] it,
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.800] is
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.940] a
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.360] challenging
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.940] story.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.180] So
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.020] the
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.300] usual
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.840] thing
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.940] is
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.060] an
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.420] experiment.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.580] You
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.640] have
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.760] a
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.080] group
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.900] of
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.440] participants,
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.620] and
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.700] we'll
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.940] talk
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.160] about
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.460] that.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.020] But
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.140] in
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.240] the
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.460] reading
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.660] for
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.980] today,
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.120] and
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.200] I
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.420] know
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.860] for
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.960] the
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.140] first
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.300] time
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.480] we've
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.620] done
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.820] this,
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.980] so
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.240] you
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.460] may
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.620] not
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.740] have
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.840] read
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.980] it.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.120] But
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.580] if
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.660] you
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.880] have,
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.080] that'd
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.120] be
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.420] great.
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.000] It's
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.220] kind
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.300] of
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.660] another
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.360] thread
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.520] of
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.600] the
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.860] kind
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.020] of
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.700] way
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.880] that
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.120] people
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.280] are
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.540] studied,
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.720] which
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.900] is
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.720] dramatic
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.360] individual
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.960] stories,
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.840] case
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.200] studies,
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.560] single
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.000] stories,
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.500] that
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.700] are
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.240] illustrative
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.680] of
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.000] something
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.180] that
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.300] we
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.480] think
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.580] are
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.820] broader
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.320] principles.
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.120] And
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.380] a
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.520] lot
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.600] of
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.740] our
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.980] biggest
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.420] discoveries,
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.580] and
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.680] we'll
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.820] come
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.900] to
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.020] that
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.220] later
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.340] in
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.420] the
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.640] course,
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.760] have
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.900] been
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.100] made
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.240] on
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.960] very
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.580] unusual
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.460] single
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.900] individuals
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.220] who
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.420] turn
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.860] out
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.380] to
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.520] have
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.640] a
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.860] lesson
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.080] that's
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.240] pretty
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.680] broad,
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.140] for
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.580] example,
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.780] for
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.900] the
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.340] organization
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.480] of
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.540] the
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.720] human
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.020] brain.
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.920] So
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.220] in
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.340] the
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.580] Oliver
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.880] Sacks
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.160] book,
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.980] there's
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.060] a
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.340] story
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.680] about
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.220] Donald.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.980] And
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.200] what
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.340] did
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.640] Donald
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.900] do
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.080] that
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.280] got
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.440] him
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.580] in
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.880] big
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.480] trouble?
[00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.890] He
[00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.250] murdered
[00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.450] his
[00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.670] girlfriend
[00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.930] while
[00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.090] he
[00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.250] was
[00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.410] on
[00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.970] PCP.
[00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.050] He's
[00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.170] in
[00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.470] a
[00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.770] psychiatric
[00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.450] hospital.
[00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.650] They
[00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.890] try
[00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.410] hypnosis
[00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.710] to
[00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.910] help
[00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.050] him
[00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.370] remember
[00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.510] it.
[00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.690] He
[00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.970] says
[00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.130] he
[00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.410] doesn't
[00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.770] remember
[00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.010] it.
[00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.650] Many
[00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.810] of
[00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.910] you
[00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.090] may
[00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.470] know
[00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.990] that
[00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.150] an
[00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.570] astounding
[00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.910] number
[00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.110] of
[00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.570] criminals
[00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.170] under
[00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.790] interrogation
[00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.310] tell
[00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.430] you
[00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.570] they
[00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.790] don't
[00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.150] remember
[00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.590] anything
[00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.990] about
[00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.370] the
[00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.690] episode
[00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.190] involved.
[00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.590] So
[00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.830] people
[00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.990] are
[00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.290] suspicious
[00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.610] at
[00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.930] first,
[00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.470] for
[00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.690] many
[00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.970] reasons.
[00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.210] Because
[00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.770] the
[00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.890] easiest
[00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.090] thing
[00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.190] to
[00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.370] say
[00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.470] is,
[00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.570] I
[00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.710] don't
[00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.110] remember
[00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.730] what
[00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.110] happened.
[00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.670] And
[00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.770] then
[00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.890] you
[00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.150] can't
[00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.350] catch
[00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.650] yourself
[00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.790] in
[00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.930] a
[00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.290] lie
[00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.510] or
[00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.710] any
[00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.130] complexity,
[00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.510] right?
[00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.710] Because
[00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.830] you
[00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.030] don't
[00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.370] remember
[00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.530] what
[00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.810] happened.
[00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.410] And
[00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.690] sometimes
[00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.870] you
[00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.030] don't
[00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.310] remember,
[00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.470] and
[00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.750] sometimes
[00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.950] you
[00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.090] do.
[00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.590] But
[00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.770] in
[00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.950] this
[00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.230] case,
[00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.630] they
[00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.870] try
[00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.390] hypnosis.
[00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.730] That
[00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.970] doesn't
[00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.190] help.
[00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.350] He's
[00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.430] in
[00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.550] there
[00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.790] for
[00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.170] four
[00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.630] years.
[00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.090] And
[00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.490] then
[00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.310] he
[00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.810] knows
[00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.570] conceptually
[00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.750] that
[00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.850] he
[00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.030] murdered
[00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.210] his
[00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.470] girlfriend.
[00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.090] And
[00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.210] he
[00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.430] says,
[00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.910] I'm
[00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.190] not
[00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.610] fit
[00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.830] for
[00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.230] society.
[00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.470] He
[00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.710] knows
[00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.850] it's
[00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.030] a
[00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.410] terrible
[00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.710] thing
[00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.830] he
[00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.090] did.
[00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.590] But
[00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.730] it's
[00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.890] kind
[00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.970] of
[00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.090] like
[00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.210] an
[00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.670] intellectual
[00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.190] knowledge,
[00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.410] right?
[00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.910] It's
[00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.990] not
[00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.090] a
[00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.370] feeling.
[00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.530] It's
[00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.630] not
[00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.750] a
[00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.950] memory.
[00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.810] And
[00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.090] then
[00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.770] he
[00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.930] goes
[00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.290] biking.
[00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.490] And
[00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.710] something
[00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.270] happens,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.000] which
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.480] is
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.460] he
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.400] gets
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.520] hit
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.660] by
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.780] a
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.980] car.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.440] And
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.980] so
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.440] there's
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.580] what
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.900] appears
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.120] to
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.280] be
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.480] a
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.860] drug
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.420]-induced
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.020] amnesia
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.580] of
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.700] the
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.140] original
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.940] murderous
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.360] episode.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.840] He
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.060] gets
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.260] hit
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.400] by
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.560] a
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.800] car.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.180] He
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.260] has
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.540] a
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.840] severe

[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.360] injury.
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.540] He's
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.600] in
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.740] a
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.940] coma
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.160] for
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.360] two
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.600] weeks.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.240] He
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.320] has
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.620] left

[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.780] he
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.960] comes
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.120] out
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.220] of
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.280] it,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.440] which
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.640] means
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.800] the
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.020] biggest
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.340] injury
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.540] was

[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.380] and
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.720] numbness.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.880] And
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.960] he
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.120] has
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.380] frontal

[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.640] that
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.840] sits
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.960] in
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.080] the
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.240] front
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.340] of
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.440] the
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.660] brain.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.500] But
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.760] now
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.860] a
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.220] remarkable
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.600] thing
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.000] happens.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.220] It's
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.300] as
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.460] if
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.020] two
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.740] insults,
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.920] two
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.340] wrongs
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.460] made
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.580] a
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.860] right,
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.620] the
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.860] first
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.060] wrong
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.200] being
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.340] the
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.900] PCP,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.240] the
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.460] second
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.740] wrong
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.020] being
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.460] the
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.960] accident,
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.500] and
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.660] now
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.820] what
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.160] happens?
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.320] He
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.780] remembers
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:20.420] in
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.020] vivid
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.300] and
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.720] florid
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.040] detail
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.240] the
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.560] horror
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.840] that
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.960] he
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.300] actually
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.620] committed
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.820] this
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.080] murder.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.600] It's
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.700] as
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.840] if
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.180] two
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.860] insults
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.920] to
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.040] the
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.220] brain,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.460] one
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.700] drug
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.040]-induced,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.660] one
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.780] a
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.040] focal
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.480] injury,
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.960] repressed
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.220] the
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.500] memory,
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.720] and
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.840] then
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.340] unrepressed
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.500] the
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.740] memory.
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.460] And
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.620] one
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.700] of
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.760] the
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.920] first
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.080] things
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.160] they
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.260] have
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.320] to
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.420] do
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.500] is
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.800] discover
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.080] whether
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.400] he
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.760] really
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.060] has
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.200] this
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.420] memory
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.580] or
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.700] he
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.860] just
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.100] thinks
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.220] he
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.380] has
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.540] this
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.800] memory.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.260] And
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.440] how
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.580] do
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.700] they
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.940] figure
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.280] out,
[00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.470] to
[00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.630] their
[00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.070] satisfaction,
[00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.410] whether
[00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.650] it's
[00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.790] a
[00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.050] really
[00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.450] recovered
[00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.810] memory
[00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.870] or
[00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.110] a
[00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.490] fabrication
[00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.790] of
[00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.910] his
[00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:44.230] mind?
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.200] Right,
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.460] that's
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.840] really
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.240] important.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.440] He
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.860] remembers
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.440] details
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.620] of
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.740] the
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.960] murder
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.140] that
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.240] are
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.580] not
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.060] publicly
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.540] available,
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.120] that
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.260] were
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.620] not
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.980] in
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.100] the
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.440] information
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.620] that
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.740] was
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.920] given
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.100] to
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.300] him.
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.520] That's
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.620] a
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.820] really
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.120] huge
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.360] issue
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.480] in
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.620] these
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.820] kinds
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.040] of
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.500] memories.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.680] So
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.800] there's
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.920] a
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.160] really
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.500] recovered
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.860] memory,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.320] not
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.620] an
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.180] inadvertently
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.800] fabricated
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.140] memory.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.960] And
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.040] they
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.340] discover
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.540] he
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.760] has
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.240] deep
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.700] seizure
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.600] activity
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.760] in
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.880] his
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.300] limbic
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.720] structures.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.000] The
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.360] parts
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.480] of
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.620] his
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.000] brain
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.700] that
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.800] are
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.060] involved
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.160] in
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.580] emotion
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.340] are
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.600] having
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.680] seizures.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.960] So
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.400] in
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.820] epilepsy,
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.500] neurons
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.640] are
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.900] firing
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.080] for
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.280] no
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.520] good
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.840] reason.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.620] And
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.740] that's
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.920] part
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.020] of
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.100] his
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.440] disorder.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.700] They
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.860] give
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.000] him
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.400] medications
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.660] to
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.840] help
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.980] with
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.240] that.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.560] But
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.880] here's
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.560] the
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.860] question
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.100] for
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.220] you
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.360] for
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.460] a
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.560] moment
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.720] to
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.940] think
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.160] about.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.340] And
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.780] it's
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.920] now
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.100] such
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.240] a
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.460] common
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.860] question,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.340] because
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.500] our
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.860] society
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.980] is
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.180] moving
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.420] that
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.680] way,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.840] that
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.980] it's
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.140] on
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.420] many
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.740] TV
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.000] shows.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.120] I
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.240] see
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.340] it
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.440] like
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.620] every
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.800] couple
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.040] weeks,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.220] there's
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.740] a
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.020] Law
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.120] and
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.320] Order
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.660] episode
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.840] that
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.980] has
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.220] something
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.420] like
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.640] this,
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.080] which
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.280] is,
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.240] the
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.520] more
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.700] you
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.940] know
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:31.240] about
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.440] the
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.020] biology
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.260] that
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.060] underlies
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.360] really
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.960] criminal,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.400] terrible
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.980] behavior,
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.920] should
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.100] that
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.240] be
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.360] a
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.580] cause
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.720] for
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.280] understanding
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.600] it
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.420] or
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.860] not?
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.760] So
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.120] in
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.280] this
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.580] case,
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.020] he
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.200] took
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.360] the
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.640] drugs.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.780] He
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.960] killed
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.100] the
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.340] person.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.460] You
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.660] think
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.800] he's
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.000] pretty
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.520] responsible.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.620] But
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.780] how
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.900] about
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.280] somebody
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.460] who
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.680] kills
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.040] somebody,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.480] and
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.580] it
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.820] turns
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.060] out,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.180] in
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.380] such
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.520] a
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.680] case,
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.820] a
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.000] man
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.160] with
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.360] no
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.620] history,
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.760] a
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.900] grown
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.040] man
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.180] with
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.420] no
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.760] history
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.720] of
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.120] criminal
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.480] activity
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.620] of
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.840] any
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.140] kind,
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.280] shoved
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.440] his
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.800] wife
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.360] out
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.460] of
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.580] a
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.840] high
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.180] window
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.380] to
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.540] her
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.860] death
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.660] in
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.800] the
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.000] course
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.140] of
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.280] a
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.640] standard
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.160] argument.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.080] Then
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.240] they
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.620] discovered
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.840] that
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.960] he
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.080] has
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.260] a
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.660] big
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.300] tumor
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.340] growing
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.060] in
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.200] the
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.480] basal
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.840] part
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.460] of
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.680] his
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.100] frontal
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.560] cortex.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.340] Now,
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.460] is
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.580] the
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.740] man
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.160] responsible
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.460] for
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.600] what
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.680] he
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.840] did?
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.180] It's
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.320] a
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.700] really
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.100] interesting
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.520] question.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.880] And
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.020] the
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.200] more
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.360] we
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.680] understand
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.980] about
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.180] the
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.520] neuroscience
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.960] of
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.120] our
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.480] brains,
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.820] what
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.080] makes
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.220] us
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.360] do
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.560] things,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.720] what
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.960] lets
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.080] us
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.440] control
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.020] impulses,
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.460] what
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.680] makes
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.820] us
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.220] murderous.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.720] There's
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.880] a
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.300] guy,
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.640] Kent
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.900] Keel,
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.180] University
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.300] of
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.500] Mexico,
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.660] was
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.880] driving
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.320] around
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.740] in
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.840] a
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.000] big
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.300] van
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.460] with
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.580] an
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.860] MRI
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.260] scanner.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.780] And
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.860] he
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:31.020] goes
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.200] from
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.040] penitentiary
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.520] to
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.260] penitentiary.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.720] And
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.860] he
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.160] images
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.380] the
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.800] brains
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.360] of
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.740] serial
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.240] murderers,
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.420] of
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.040] psychopathic
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.540] murderers.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.520] And
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.680] he's
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.880] getting
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.160] things
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.260] that
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.320] are
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.500] pretty
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.900] systematically
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.500] different
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.760] about
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.900] their
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.240] brains.
[00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.670] And
[00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.770] the
[00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.010] question
[00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.210] is,
[00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.810] what
[00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.930] does
[00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.130] that
[00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:44.290] mean?
[00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.390] Does
[00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.510] that
[00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.610] mean
[00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.750] those
[00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.990] people
[00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.150] were
[00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.530] prone
[00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.690] to
[00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.870] do
[00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.990] it
[00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.130] for
[00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.470] reasons
[00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.610] of
[00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.730] their
[00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.990] early
[00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.510] environment,
[00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.810] or
[00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:48.230] genes,
[00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.410] or
[00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.630] some
[00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.010] incident
[00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.190] that
[00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.470] happened?
[00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:50.190] If
[00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.430] that's
[00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.550] the
[00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.770] case,
[00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.870] do
[00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.970] you
[00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.230] forgive
[00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.410] them
[00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.810] differently?
[00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:52.070] Should
[00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.210] we
[00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.370] have
[00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.490] a
[00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.010] different
[00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.370] moral
[00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.810] code
[00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.550] or
[00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.810] legal
[00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.130] code
[00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.270] as
[00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.390] we
[00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.770] discover
[00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.950] the
[00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.150] brain
[00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.430] basis
[00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.690] for
[00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.890] some
[00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.970] of
[00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.110] these
[00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.410] things?
[00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.870] Or
[00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.950] is
[00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.090] that
[00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.630] irrelevant,
[00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.190] what
[00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.430] counts
[00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.550] as
[00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.690] the
[00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.030] action?
[00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.230] So
[00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.410] this
[00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.590] is
[00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.010] the
[00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.090] kind
[00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.150] of
[00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.250] thing
[00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.310] you
[00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.430] could
[00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.670] think
[00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.990] about,
[00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.230] maybe
[00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.570] discuss
[00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.690] in
[00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.810] your
[00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.190] section
[00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.470] some.
[00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.650] The
[00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.850] more
[00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.990] we
[00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.270] understand
[00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.470] about
[00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.610] the
[00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.810] human
[00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.050] brain,
[00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.210] the
[00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.450] more
[00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.610] we'll
[00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.970] understand
[00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.230] about
[00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.670] behaviors
[00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.850] that
[00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.950] we
[00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.170] find
[00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.590] terrible.
[00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.490] And
[00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.610] what
[00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.710] does
[00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.830] that
[00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.950] mean
[00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.170] about
[00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.490] legal
[00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.830] and
[00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.090] moral
[00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.590] decisions
[00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.130] about
[00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.330] how
[00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.490] to
[00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.790] punish
[00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.010] those
[00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.130] or
[00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.310] think
[00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.550] about
[00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.790] those?
[00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.710] So
[00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.190] that's
[00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.430] coming
[00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.610] in
[00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.730] your
[00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.130] lifetime,
[00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.430] because
[00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.830] there's
[00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.170] steady
[00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.550] progress
[00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.790] on
[00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.050] this.
[00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.390] And
[00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.050] how
[00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.190] to
[00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.410] think
[00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.650] about
[00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.850] that
[00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.990] is
[00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.070] a
[00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.250] really
[00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.630] big
[00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.990] question.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.600] So
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.040] I'm
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.080] going
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.120] to
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.260] talk
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.380] with

[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.760] today
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.560] about

[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.660] and
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.140] psychology.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.720] And
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.840] a
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.980] funny
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.160] thing
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.360] about

[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.000] and
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.100] I'll
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.240] come
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.440] back

[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.100] amateur
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.660] psychologist.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.320] They
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.580] have
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.680] to
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.800] be.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.940] If
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.040] you
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.220] deal

[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.980] psychologist.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.640] Moreover,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.080] we
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.280] live
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.360] in
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.460] a

[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.260] life.

[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:00.340] crazy

[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.940] take
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.060] it
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.380] seriously.

[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.280] Almost
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.780] half
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.920] of

[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.740] enter
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.180] adulthood
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.420] as
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.860] worried,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.180] underachieving,

[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.480] OK.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.740] So
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.080] that
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.300] sounds

[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.100] to
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.320] argue
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.540] about
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.700] the
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.080] importance

[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.800] This
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:23.860] is
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.940] the

[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.780] So
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:24.940] let's
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.100] think

[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.360] Almost

[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.400] jobs

[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.460] A
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:41.660] little.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.040] OK.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:42.720] Who's
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:42.900] not

[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:43.580] A
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:43.760] little,
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.320] a

[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.220] So
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.580] it
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.040] doesn't

[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.340] Without
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.780] divorce,
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.180] right?
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.020] Because
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.200] that's
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:53.280] the

[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:54.120] It's
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.320] not,
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:54.640] are
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:54.900] people
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.220] worried
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:55.420] about
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:55.900] stuff?
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.080] Underachieving.
[00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.510] Compared
[00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.710] to
[00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.850] what?
[00:07:58.910 --> 00:07:59.030] How
[00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.170] would
[00:07:59.170 --> 00:07:59.270] you

[00:07:59.590 --> 00:07:59.970] somebody's
[00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:00.470] underachieving?
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.440] Scientifically.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.220] OK.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:03.840] I
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:03.960] mean,
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.020] most

[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.040] underachieved
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.460] and
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:07.680] days

[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:08.400] pretty
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:08.680] well.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:08.900] But
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:09.020] how
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.140] would
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.240] you
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.540] measure

[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:11.780] Well,
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.020] sometimes
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.160] we
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.240] think
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:12.320] it's

[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:14.540] What's
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:14.640] the

[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:40.600] what
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:40.720] is
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.820] consequences
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.140] of
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.380] divorces
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:42.540] in
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:42.940] families?
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:43.860] Should
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:43.940] we
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.080] be
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.280] thinking
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:44.540] about
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:44.760] things
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:44.900] that
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.860] encourage
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.480] marriages
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:47.740] to
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.020] stay
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.360] stable
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.480] and
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:48.680] things
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:48.900] like
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.320] that?
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.380] But
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:50.480] there's
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:50.660] really
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:50.880] no
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.380] information
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:51.920] at
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.240] all
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.540] from
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.080] a
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.420] researcher
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:55.780] science
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.260] perspective.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:56.780] So
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:56.860] I'm
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:56.920] going
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:56.940] to
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.080] talk
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.260] about
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:57.320] a
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:57.420] little
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:57.580] bit,
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:57.780] just
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.160] reminding
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.320] you
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:58.460] what
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:58.780] science
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:58.980] is.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:08:59.380] We're
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:08:59.460] at
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:08:59.520] a
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:08:59.880] university,
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.220] obviously,
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:00.400] that
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:00.720] thinks
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:00.940] about
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.260] science
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:01.400] and
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:01.560] does
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:01.800] science
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:01.960] all
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.060] the
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:02.380] time.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.560] Remind
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:03.680] you
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:03.760] of
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:03.840] what
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:03.960] an
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.340] experiment
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:04.800] is,
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:04.960] a
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.180] very
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.500] brief
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:05.780] history
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:05.920] of
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.360] psychology
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:06.840] experimentation,
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.620] and
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:07.740] then
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.000] walk
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.120] you
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.240] through
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.380] a
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:08.560] few
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:08.960] experiments
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.100] that
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.200] I
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.420] find
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:09.600] kind
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:09.720] of
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.260] interesting,
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.620] and
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:11.740] then
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:11.960] some
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.220] topics
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:12.520] related
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:12.660] to
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.020] psychology.
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.240] So
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:13.340] let
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.400] me
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:13.560] start
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:13.700] with
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:13.920] this.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.440] How
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:14.640] do
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:14.780] you
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:14.960] know
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.140] what
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:15.260] is
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:15.500] true?
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:16.860] How
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:17.000] do
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.160] you
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.360] know
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:17.520] what
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:17.640] is
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:17.860] true,
[00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.230] that
[00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.310] you
[00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.550] take
[00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.690] to
[00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:19.810] be
[00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:19.990] true?
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:25.580] What
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:25.680] is
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:25.760] the
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:25.900] answer?
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.120] Everyone's
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.260] looking
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:26.360] all
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:26.460] like,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:26.600] how
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:26.700] do
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:26.800] I
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:26.900] know?
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.440] Please
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:27.580] tell
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:27.680] me.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:29.100] Well,
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:29.660] when
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:29.820] people
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.020] try
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:30.160] to
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:30.480] analyze
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:30.720] this,
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:30.860] and
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:30.940] you
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.020] can
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.220] think
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:31.400] about
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:31.480] it
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:31.620] for
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:31.800] your
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.080] own
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.340] self,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.760] one
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:33.860] of
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:33.980] them
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.100] is
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.480] authority.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:35.760] Parents,
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:36.540] teachers,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.300] textbooks,
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.060] scientists,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:38.620] professors
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:38.800] in
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.060] courses,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.260] we
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:39.480] tell
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:39.700] you
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.140] this
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.320] is
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.460] the
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.720] truth.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.480] And
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:41.580] if
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:41.640] you
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:41.920] remember
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.080] the
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.260] truth
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:42.620] correctly,
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:42.760] you
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:42.880] get
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.020] an
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.160] A.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.000] So
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.360] authority
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:45.500] is
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:45.580] a
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:45.740] huge
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:45.920] source.
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.020] I
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.140] mean,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:46.500] it
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:46.580] would
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:46.680] be
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:46.980] costly
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.120] to
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.200] go
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.360] around
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.440] and
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:47.560] kind
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:47.620] of
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:47.720] have
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:47.840] your
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.060] own
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.420] idea
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:48.720] about
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.000] everything.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.320] 12
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:49.580] inches
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:49.760] and
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:49.860] a
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:49.980] foot,
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.220] I'm
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:50.360] not
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.600] taking
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:50.780] that
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.000] piece
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.120] of
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.520] information
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:51.820] without
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.120] skepticism.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:52.800] You
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.700] couldn't
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:53.860] lead
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:53.980] your
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.180] life
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.440] without
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:54.780] kind
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:54.860] of
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.140] believing
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.320] a
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.420] lot
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:55.500] of
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:55.780] stuff.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:55.960] But
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.060] you
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:56.160] know
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.280] you
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:56.380] don't
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:56.500] want
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:56.580] to
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:56.760] believe
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.160] everything,
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.580] just
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:57.760] because
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:57.860] you
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:58.040] hear
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.180] it.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.000] Repetition
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.400] or
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:09:59.820] tenacity.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:00.200] You
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.320] hear
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:00.580] something
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:00.880] often
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.220] enough,
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.460] and
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:02.700] people
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:02.920] tend
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.100] to
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.320] believe
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:03.620] stuff.
[00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:05.650] A
[00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.030] priori,
[00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:06.250] what's
[00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:06.570] reasonable?
[00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.790] You
[00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.970] think
[00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.250] things
[00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.510] through
[00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:07.710] just
[00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.890] by
[00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:08.270] thought.
[00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.590] What's
[00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.410] possible,
[00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.870] rational,
[00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.130] and
[00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.270] so
[00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:10.510] on?
[00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.830] And
[00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:12.230] then
[00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.630] maybe
[00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.770] a
[00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.010] fourth
[00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:13.690] brand
[00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:13.810] of
[00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:14.130] knowledge
[00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:14.350] to
[00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.830] something
[00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.010] is
[00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:15.330] scientific
[00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:15.850] analysis,
[00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:16.250] where
[00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.370] we
[00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.510] have
[00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:16.970] hypotheses,
[00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.250] and
[00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:17.370] we
[00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:17.610] test
[00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:17.770] them
[00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:17.870] in
[00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.090] some
[00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:18.390] version
[00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:18.530] of
[00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.990] experiments,
[00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:19.590] or
[00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.830] at
[00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:19.890] least
[00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:20.530] correlations
[00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:20.790] among
[00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.030] data.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:22.720] Now,
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:22.860] there's
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.080] another
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.420] view,
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.440] which
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.600] is
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:24.760] kind
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:24.920] of
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.960] that
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.580] whatever
[00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.170] we
[00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:28.410] think
[00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:28.730] makes
[00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.010] something
[00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:29.430] science
[00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.630] is
[00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.830] what
[00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.010] the
[00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:30.370] scientific
[00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.070] community
[00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.730] decides
[00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.870] as
[00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:32.010] a
[00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:32.350] community
[00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.730] is
[00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.030] true.
[00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:34.750] Roughly
[00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.030] speaking,
[00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.250] that
[00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:35.390] is,
[00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.890] the
[00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:36.610] mainstay
[00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:36.810] of
[00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:37.170] faculty
[00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:37.330] at
[00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:37.530] places
[00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:37.750] like
[00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.070] MIT
[00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.310] and
[00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.650] Stanford
[00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:38.910] and
[00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.210] Harvard
[00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:39.410] and
[00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.610] so
[00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:39.830] on,
[00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:40.190] and
[00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.470] around
[00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.650] the
[00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:40.810] world
[00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:40.970] at
[00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:41.390] universities,
[00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:41.650] tell
[00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:41.750] you
[00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.090] this
[00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:42.390] is
[00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:42.750] how
[00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.130] science
[00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.350] works,
[00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:43.470] you
[00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:43.570] go,
[00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.830] OK,
[00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.130] that's
[00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:44.250] how
[00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:44.490] science
[00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:44.770] works.
[00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:45.290] I
[00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.870] remember
[00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:46.070] some
[00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:46.250] years
[00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.550] ago,
[00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.110] there
[00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.210] was
[00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.810] a
[00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:48.270] lot
[00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:48.410] of
[00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.770] excitement
[00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:49.110] about
[00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.970] a
[00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.130] satirical
[00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:51.410] article
[00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.690] written
[00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:51.890] by
[00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:52.090] a
[00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:52.370] scientist,
[00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.010] where
[00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:53.130] he
[00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:53.390] said,
[00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:53.590] oh,
[00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:53.750] this
[00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.850] is
[00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:54.050] all
[00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.310] just
[00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.770] societal
[00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.290] authority.
[00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.910] Scientists
[00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.150] tell
[00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.230] you
[00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.430] what's
[00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.570] true
[00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:56.750] just
[00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.870] because
[00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.030] they
[00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.330] believe
[00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:57.470] in
[00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.590] it,
[00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:57.730] just
[00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.010] like
[00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:58.350] a
[00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.610] sports
[00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.810] writer
[00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.130] says
[00:10:59.130 --> 00:10:59.370] the
[00:10:59.370 --> 00:10:59.710] Celtics
[00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.830] are
[00:10:59.830 --> 00:10:59.970] the
[00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:00.210] best.
[00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.070] You
[00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:01.210] don't
[00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:01.490] really
[00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.710] think
[00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.810] that
[00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:01.930] the
[00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:02.130] sports
[00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.330] writer
[00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:02.530] knows
[00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:02.970] scientifically
[00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:03.170] the
[00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.490] Celtics
[00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:03.610] are
[00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:03.730] the
[00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:03.970] best,
[00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.170] right?
[00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:06.750] So
[00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.230] he
[00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.410] wrote
[00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:07.510] a
[00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:07.670] paper
[00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.910] saying
[00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:08.070] that
[00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:08.570] gravity
[00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.090] is
[00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:09.350] simply
[00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.490] a
[00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:09.910] consensus
[00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.290] among
[00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:10.910] scientists,
[00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:11.790] and
[00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.890] a
[00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:12.190] particular
[00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.430] view
[00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.630] they're
[00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.990] foisting
[00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.130] on
[00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.550] society.
[00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:14.930] But
[00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:15.290] none
[00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.390] of
[00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:15.510] us
[00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:15.590] would
[00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.690] want
[00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:15.750] to
[00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.910] really
[00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.310] go
[00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.470] up
[00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.590] there
[00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.690] and
[00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:16.830] jump
[00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:16.970] out
[00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:17.090] the
[00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.310] window
[00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:17.610] going,
[00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.770] well,
[00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:18.170] gravity
[00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.430] is
[00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.870] one
[00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.230] person's
[00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.490] opinion,
[00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:19.650] and
[00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:19.770] now
[00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:19.890] here's
[00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:20.090] my
[00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.390] opinion,
[00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:20.650] right?
[00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:22.170] But
[00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.490] it's
[00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.630] kind
[00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.730] of
[00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:23.050] interesting,
[00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.390] because
[00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.330] for
[00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:24.550] those
[00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.670] of
[00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.770] you
[00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:24.890] who
[00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:25.030] go
[00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.170] to
[00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:25.450] medical
[00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:25.710] school,
[00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:25.870] for
[00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.150] example,
[00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:26.310] you
[00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.470] learn
[00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.790] lots
[00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.910] of
[00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.310] procedures
[00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.510] and
[00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:27.650] so
[00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.830] on
[00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:27.930] that
[00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.210] the
[00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.030] medical
[00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.350] community
[00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.650] believes
[00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:29.770] is
[00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:29.990] true,
[00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:30.450] where
[00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:30.590] there's
[00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.750] not
[00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.930] much
[00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:31.250] scientific
[00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.650] evidence
[00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:31.990] behind
[00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.170] it,
[00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.470] but
[00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.590] they
[00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.770] have
[00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:32.890] to
[00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:33.030] use
[00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.110] it
[00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.310] every
[00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.490] day.
[00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:35.270] So
[00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:35.630] you're
[00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.810] used
[00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.930] to
[00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.090] hearing
[00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.290] about
[00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.430] the
[00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.710] scientific
[00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.050] method.
[00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:37.230] It
[00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.570] applies
[00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:37.770] to
[00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.310] psychology
[00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.230] in
[00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.490] many
[00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:39.890] ways,
[00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:40.270] just
[00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:40.430] like
[00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.550] it
[00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.810] applies
[00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:40.990] to
[00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.350] chemistry,
[00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.830] physics,
[00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.070] or
[00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:42.510] biology.
[00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.470] We
[00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.630] have
[00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:43.730] to
[00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.990] test
[00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.230] things
[00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.350] that
[00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.430] are
[00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.110] falsifiable.
[00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.130] We
[00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.310] have
[00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.430] to
[00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.610] deal
[00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:46.730] in
[00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.250] probabilities
[00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:47.470] of
[00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.910] outcomes
[00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.410] in
[00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:48.570] terms
[00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:48.670] of
[00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.090] statistics
[00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.330] in
[00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:49.530] some
[00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:49.850] sense.
[00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.310] The
[00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.630] kinds
[00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:51.750] of
[00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.930] data
[00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:52.090] we
[00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:52.210] can
[00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:52.450] have
[00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:52.550] are
[00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.970] descriptive,
[00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:53.290] or
[00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:53.910] correlative,
[00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.170] or
[00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.850] experimental.
[00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:55.690] I'll
[00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:55.890] talk
[00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:56.070] about
[00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:56.250] those
[00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:56.330] in
[00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:56.450] a
[00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:56.650] moment.
[00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:57.670] We
[00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.070] are
[00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:58.330] always
[00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:58.590] trying
[00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.730] to
[00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:59.090] disprove
[00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.250] the
[00:11:59.250 --> 00:11:59.490] null
[00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.050] hypothesis
[00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.610] statistically,
[00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:00.910] as
[00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.030] you
[00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.150] know.
[00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:01.630] We
[00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:01.870] can't
[00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.090] prove
[00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.230] that
[00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.490] something
[00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:02.650] is
[00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:02.890] true,
[00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.070] but
[00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:03.170] we
[00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.290] can
[00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.570] prove
[00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:03.710] that
[00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.850] it's
[00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.110] not
[00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.390] true.
[00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.670] And
[00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.810] then
[00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:06.190] finally,
[00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.470] like
[00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.770] all
[00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.010] fields
[00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:08.170] of
[00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:08.550] science,
[00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.090] today's
[00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:10.290] most
[00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:10.690] exciting
[00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:11.230] breakthroughs
[00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.310] are
[00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.870] tomorrow's
[00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.390] things
[00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:12.530] that
[00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:12.650] have
[00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.750] to
[00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.910] be
[00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.290] apologized
[00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:13.650] for
[00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:13.790] and
[00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.370] rediscovered.
[00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.530] I
[00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:15.690] mean,
[00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.870] what
[00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.170] makes
[00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:16.530] something
[00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:17.110] breaking
[00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.650] science
[00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:17.910] is
[00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:18.130] not
[00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:18.330] that
[00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:18.450] it's
[00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:18.610] known
[00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:18.730] with
[00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.050] certainty.
[00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.290] What's
[00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:19.410] known
[00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:19.550] with
[00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.790] certainty
[00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:20.070] is
[00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:20.290] what's
[00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:20.370] in
[00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:20.490] your
[00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:20.830] textbook,
[00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.310] kind
[00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.450] of.
[00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:22.570] What
[00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:22.790] makes
[00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.090] something
[00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.410] breaking
[00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:23.810] science
[00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:24.070] is
[00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:24.210] it
[00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:24.390] moves
[00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:24.510] the
[00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:24.670] field
[00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.030] forward.
[00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:25.650] So
[00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:25.850] what's
[00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.930] the
[00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:26.170] difference
[00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:26.430] between
[00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.590] the
[00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.830] cutting
[00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.090] edge
[00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:27.190] and
[00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.310] the
[00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.510] bleeding
[00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:27.770] edge
[00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:27.870] is
[00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:28.010] a
[00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:28.350] very
[00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.930] close
[00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:29.330] call.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.420] So
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:31.660] here's
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:31.780] a
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.060] cartoon
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.300] that
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.540] says
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:33.620] he's
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:33.980] constantly
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.460] proving
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:34.720] his
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.280] experiments
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.020] wrong.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.100] And
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:37.220] the
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:37.440] guy's
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:37.560] kind
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:37.660] of
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:37.960] glum,
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.240] looking
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.440] over.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:38.680] He's
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.000] proving
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.160] the
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.300] null
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:39.780] hypothesis
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.120] to
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.320] be
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.660] correct.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:41.560] Now,
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.100] that's
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.260] sort
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:42.380] of
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:42.720] funny
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.820] for
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:44.160] scientists.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:44.860] But
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.900] it's
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.080] sort
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.180] of
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:46.380] funny
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:46.580] in
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:46.700] the
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:46.880] sense
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.100] that,
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.320] no,
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:47.480] we
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:47.600] don't
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:47.780] really
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:47.900] go
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.120] around
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.300] going,
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:48.460] I
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:48.780] hope
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.160] with
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.420] all
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:50.620] my
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:50.860] heart
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.000] for
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.140] this
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:51.480] research
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:51.800] project
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:51.980] I've
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.120] worked
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.200] on
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.320] for
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:52.460] the
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:52.680] last
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:52.920] five
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.160] years
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:53.300] that
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:53.400] it
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:53.520] will
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.120] prove
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.360] the
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:54.540] null
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.080] hypothesis.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:55.580] There's
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:55.800] no
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.220] difference
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:56.800] between
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.020] things
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:57.160] I'm
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:57.420] studying.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.440] In
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:58.620] fact,
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.020] scientists,
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:12:59.240] like
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:12:59.440] all
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:12:59.700] humans,
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:12:59.940] have
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.280] agendas
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:00.520] and
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:00.740] hopes,
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.620] like
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:01.920] everybody
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.280] else.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.180] So
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:03.320] they
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:03.580] observe,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.220] hypothesize,
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.720] experiment,
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.360] assess
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:05.640] data.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.040] It
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.320] doesn't
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:06.520] always
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:06.720] go
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.180] perfectly,
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.460] right?
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.180] And
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:09.280] the
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:09.460] last
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:09.580] thing
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:09.640] I
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:09.720] want
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:09.760] to
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:09.920] say
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.060] is
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:10.560] I'm
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:10.620] going
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:10.720] to
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.080] emphasize
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.540] today
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.540] a
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:12.900] scientific
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.360] approach
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:13.640] to
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:13.920] the
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.100] human
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.520] mind
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:14.760] and
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.180] behavior.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:15.840] But
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.000] of
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.300] course,
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:16.940] there's
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.420] many
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:17.820] other
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.220] paths
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:18.380] of
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:18.680] knowledge
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:18.900] for
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.220] important
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:19.460] things
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:19.600] in
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:19.740] our
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:19.980] life,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.440] religion,
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.100] philosophy,
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:21.580] arts,
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:21.760] and
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:21.920] so
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.120] on.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:22.500] There's
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:22.740] many
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:22.980] things
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.100] that
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.420] science
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:23.820] cannot
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.140] address.
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:24.280] And
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.340] I
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:24.440] don't
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:24.560] want
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:24.640] to
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:24.880] pretend
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.100] that
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:25.200] it
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.400] does.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.520] That's
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:26.620] not
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:26.720] a
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:26.940] problem
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.200] too
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.460] much
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:27.740] when
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:27.840] you
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.040] think
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.280] about
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:28.660] chemistry.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:28.900] It's
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.020] kind
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:29.080] of
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.240] an
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.540] interesting
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:29.840] problem
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:29.940] when
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:29.980] you
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.120] think
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.320] about
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.020] psychology.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.400] Because
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:31.520] when
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:31.620] we
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:31.780] think
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.040] about
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.720] happiness
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.000] or
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.640] values
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:33.840] or
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.000] things
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.180] like
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:34.400] that,
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:34.780] those
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.220] topics
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:35.620] cut
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.080] across
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.960] psychology
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.520] and
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:37.780] things
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.000] like
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.360] religion,
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.060] philosophy,
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:39.760] and
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.080] topics
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.340] like
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:40.540] that.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:41.600] So
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:41.740] what
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:41.940] makes
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.200] something
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:42.340] an
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:42.920] experiment
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.600] is
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:43.700] you
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:43.880] have
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:43.980] to
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.160] have
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.560] two
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:44.940] things,
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:45.880] conceptually
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.280] especially,
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.000] the
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.440] dependent
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:47.960] variable,
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.140] what
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:48.280] you
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:48.620] measure,
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.140] the
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:49.480] outcome,
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.020] and
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:50.180] the
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:50.640] independent
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.120] variable,
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:51.480] what
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:51.620] you
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:51.900] vary.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:52.640] Once
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:52.740] you
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:52.880] have
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.140] those
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:53.420] things
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:53.520] in
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:53.660] an
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.040] experiment,
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:54.340] you're
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:54.560] kind
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:54.660] of
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:54.760] an
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.140] experiment
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:55.920] in
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.040] a
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.240] broad
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:56.600] sense.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:57.560] So
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:57.680] in
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.220] psychology,
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:58.800] it
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:58.940] took
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.060] a
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.240] long
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.460] time.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:13:59.540] It
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:13:59.680] wasn't
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:13:59.820] until
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:13:59.920] the
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.480] 1800s
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:00.600] that
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:00.800] people
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.020] had
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:01.280] kind
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:01.360] of
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:01.500] an
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.060] approach
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:02.720] to
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:02.900] doing
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.420] experiments
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:03.640] in
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.120] psychology.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:04.720] And
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:04.960] figuring
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.260] out,
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:05.420] for
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:05.740] example,
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:05.980] how
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.080] to
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.280] use
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:06.560] the
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:06.900] simple
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.340] measurement
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:07.580] of
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.100] time
[00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.030] to
[00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.230] measure
[00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.470] how
[00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.830] long
[00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.090] a
[00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:10.510] mental
[00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.230] operation
[00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.030] lasts
[00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.330] in
[00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:12.450] your
[00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:12.750] mind.
[00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:13.030] So
[00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.170] that's
[00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:13.350] pretty
[00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.650] cool.
[00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.270] If
[00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:14.350] you
[00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:14.430] were
[00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.530] to
[00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:14.690] come
[00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.830] to
[00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:14.930] a
[00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:15.070] fifth
[00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:15.290] grader
[00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.390] and
[00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:15.490] say,
[00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:15.710] how
[00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.910] would
[00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.050] you
[00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:16.390] measure
[00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.030] not
[00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.630] a
[00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.630] brick
[00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.150] or
[00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.330] a
[00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:19.650] stone,
[00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:19.910] but
[00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:20.350] how
[00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.930] long
[00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:21.230] a
[00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.590] thought
[00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.270] takes,
[00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.750] you'd
[00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.870] say,
[00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:23.970] well,
[00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.130] that'd
[00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:24.190] be
[00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:24.370] pretty
[00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:24.790] hard.
[00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:24.970] But
[00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:25.070] it
[00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:25.270] turns
[00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:25.430] out
[00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.550] it's
[00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.810] not
[00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:26.070] as
[00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:26.370] hard
[00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.470] in
[00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.610] a
[00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:27.830] simple
[00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:28.070] way.
[00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:28.630] So
[00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:28.990] Wilhelm
[00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.310] Wundt,
[00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:29.970] a
[00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:30.390] big
[00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:30.610] figure
[00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:30.730] in
[00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.110] psychology,
[00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:31.350] first
[00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.710] textbook
[00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.910] in
[00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.310] psychology,
[00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:32.690] first
[00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:33.170] laboratory
[00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.390] in
[00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:33.810] psychology,
[00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:34.450] did
[00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:34.610] the
[00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.850] following
[00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:35.150] test
[00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.290] of
[00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:35.570] mental
[00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.110] chronometry,
[00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.450] simply
[00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.250] measuring
[00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.730] how
[00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.930] long
[00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:38.070] it
[00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:38.250] takes
[00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:38.350] you
[00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.450] to
[00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:38.570] do
[00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:38.810] things.
[00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.470] So
[00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.690] he
[00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:39.850] would
[00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:40.550] show
[00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.690] you
[00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:40.790] a
[00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.990] light,
[00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.270] and
[00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:41.410] he'd
[00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:41.630] simply
[00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:41.910] press
[00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:42.050] the
[00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.290] button,
[00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.550] and
[00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.690] that
[00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:42.810] would
[00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:42.990] take
[00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.210] about
[00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:43.790] a
[00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.990] fifth
[00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.130] of
[00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:44.230] a
[00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.450] second.
[00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.910] And
[00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.030] then
[00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.130] he
[00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:46.250] would
[00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.450] say,
[00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:46.770] instead,
[00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:47.310] you
[00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.530] do
[00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:47.870] this.
[00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:48.250] If
[00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:48.370] the
[00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:48.530] light
[00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.730] turns
[00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:48.910] on
[00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.990] and
[00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.130] it's
[00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:49.450] red,
[00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:49.850] you
[00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:50.050] push
[00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:50.270] one
[00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:50.530] button.
[00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.890] And
[00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:50.950] if
[00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.090] it's
[00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:51.310] green,
[00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:51.470] you
[00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.650] push
[00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:51.890] another.
[00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:52.650] So
[00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:52.810] his
[00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.110] idea
[00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.530] was
[00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.030] the
[00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.270] motor
[00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:54.590] system
[00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.770] to
[00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:54.990] push
[00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.130] the
[00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:55.390] button
[00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:55.510] is
[00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:55.730] about
[00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.950] the
[00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:56.210] same.
[00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.690] The
[00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.070] time
[00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:57.250] to
[00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:57.810] observe
[00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:58.130] the
[00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:58.410] light
[00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:58.770] is
[00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:58.990] about
[00:14:58.990 --> 00:14:59.190] the
[00:14:59.190 --> 00:14:59.470] same.
[00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:00.050] But
[00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.230] the
[00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.490] difference
[00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:00.810] between
[00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:01.050] these
[00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:01.330] two
[00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:01.770] is
[00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:01.970] how
[00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:02.230] long
[00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.410] it
[00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:02.730] takes
[00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:02.950] to
[00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:03.230] make
[00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.610] a
[00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:04.050] choice,
[00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.890] how
[00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:05.170] long
[00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:05.330] it
[00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:05.590] takes
[00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.770] to
[00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:05.930] make
[00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.070] a
[00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:06.430] choice.
[00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:07.110] And
[00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.390] that
[00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:07.850] difference,
[00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:08.030] when
[00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.130] he
[00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:08.570] subtracts
[00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:08.710] them,
[00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.150] took
[00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.410] about
[00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.570] a
[00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:09.730] tenth
[00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:09.850] of
[00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:09.970] a
[00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:10.210] second
[00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:10.650] by
[00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:10.830] that
[00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:11.150] measurement.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.100] So
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.220] all
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:12.300] of
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:12.360] a
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:12.480] sudden,
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:12.640] you
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:12.740] could
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:12.940] start
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.140] to
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:13.420] measure,
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:13.740] in
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:13.840] an
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.180] objective
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:14.620] sense,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.480] how
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.900] long
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.580] a
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:16.780] mental
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.220] operation
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:17.560] takes
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:17.680] in
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:17.800] your
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.080] mind.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.420] Then
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:20.740] psychology
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:20.920] went
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.040] a
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.160] lot
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:21.240] of
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.460] different
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:21.820] directions.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.020] A
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:22.240] famous
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:22.540] one
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:22.880] from
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.260] Titchener,
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:23.400] who
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:23.680] worked
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:23.860] with
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.140] Wundt,
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:24.880] developed
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.140] a

[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:25.820] department
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.000] at
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.340] Cornell,
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:26.680] was
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.220] introspection.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:27.460] Look
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:27.800] inside
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.040] yourself
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:28.200] and
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:28.380] think
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:28.660] very
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.060] carefully
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:29.800] when
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.000] you
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.540] think
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:30.740] about
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:30.900] a
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.180] topic.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:31.500] How
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:31.680] do
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:31.800] I
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.040] think
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:32.320] about
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:32.500] it?
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:33.780] That
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.180] lost
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.240] its
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.380] way
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:35.480] as
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:35.600] a
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:35.920] scientific
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.360] method.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:36.880] Trouble
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.200] is,
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.040] one
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.300] person
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.520] thinks
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:38.760] one
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:38.960] way,
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:39.080] and
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.200] one
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:39.380] person
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:39.620] thinks
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:39.840] another
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.080] way,
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:40.560] and
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:40.640] you
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:40.820] can't
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:40.980] really
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.260] settle
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:41.460] it.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:43.500] So
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:43.900] introspection
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.160] about
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.300] your
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:44.520] thoughts
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:44.620] is
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:44.740] a
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.020] private
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.480] process.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:45.780] It's
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:45.880] not
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.000] a
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.300] public
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:46.780] measure
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:46.980] that
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.080] you
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.200] can
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.600] exchange
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:47.820] among
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.440] scientists,
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:48.720] like
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.120] time
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.260] or
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:49.600] measurements.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:50.860] But
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:50.980] we
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.180] still
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:51.500] introspect
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:51.760] a
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:51.920] lot
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.040] when
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.160] we
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:52.320] think
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:52.540] about
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:52.980] psychology,
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:53.200] whether
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:53.360] it
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:53.560] feels
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:53.760] right
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:53.880] to
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.000] us,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.100] what
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.160] are
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:54.280] the
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:54.600] questions
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:54.800] to
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.100] ask.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.280] It's
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:55.420] still
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:55.600] just
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:55.800] being
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.100] human.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:56.480] You
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:56.700] can't
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:56.880] help
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:56.980] but
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.360] introspect
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:57.700] about
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.200] psychology
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:58.680] topics.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:15:59.840] In
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:15:59.980] the
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.400] US,
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.040] there
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:01.160] was
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.280] a
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.080] huge
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.620] response
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.500] to
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.840] introspection
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.020] as
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.180] being
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.420] too
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:05.680] loose,
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.180] too
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:06.500] loosey
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:06.800]-goosey.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.520] One
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:07.820] famous
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.040] name
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.120] in
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.240] this
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:08.360] is
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:08.580] John
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:08.960] Watson.
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:09.200] He
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.320] said,
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:09.480] the
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:09.980] mind
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.520] is
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.140] unobservable,
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:11.800] so
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:11.900] we
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.000] can
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.200] only
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:12.440] study
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:12.880] behavior,
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.220] things
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:13.380] that
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:13.620] people
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:13.940] do,
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.400] actions
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:15.560] they
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:15.820] take,
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:15.980] their
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.260] mouth
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:16.580] moves,
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:16.760] their
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.040] hand
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:17.420] buttons,
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.200] presses.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:18.400] And
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:18.500] then
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:18.600] we
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.020] identify
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.280] what
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.400] in
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.520] the
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:19.900] environment
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.520] influences
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.040] those
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:21.600] behaviors.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:22.580] The
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.160] principles
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.420] of
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:23.520] the
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:23.720] mind
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:23.860] should
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:23.980] be
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:24.260] similar
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:24.520] between
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:24.900] animals
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.100] and
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.460] humans,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.060] and
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:26.140] that
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.240] the
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.420] only
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:26.660] thing
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:26.760] a
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.360] responsible
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:28.500] experimental
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:28.900] scientist
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.180] can
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:29.380] do
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:29.520] is
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:29.840] relate
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.480] environmental
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:30.980] factors
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.860] to
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.280] actions.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:33.520] And
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.660] so
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:33.840] there's
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.000] a
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.420] stimulus,
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:34.780] and
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:34.900] you
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.000] can
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.260] control
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:35.440] the
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:35.660] stimulus
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:35.860] as
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:36.020] a
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:36.260] scientist.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:36.600] There's
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:36.700] a
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.080] response.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:37.240] You
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:37.400] measure
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:37.520] the
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:37.940] response.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:38.420] And
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:38.660] that's
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:38.780] your
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.240] psychology
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.880] experiment.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:41.440] And
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:41.620] then
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.660] the
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.360] 1980s
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:43.760] became
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:43.960] the
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.240] cognitive
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:44.740] revolution.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.220] Partly,
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:45.620] this
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.060] path
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:46.260] led,
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.140] after
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:47.240] a
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:47.360] while,
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:47.500] to
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:47.680] not
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:47.900] very
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:48.240] interesting
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:48.820] science.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.120] That
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.240] was
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:49.360] the
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.520] biggest
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:49.880] problem.
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:50.680] And
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:50.860] people
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.060] said,
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.260] no,
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:51.420] we
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:51.540] can
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:51.720] make
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.220] inferences
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:52.540] about
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:52.740] the
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.140] mind
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:53.800] as
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:53.940] it
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.560] translates
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:54.860] what
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:54.980] it
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.300] hears
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:55.480] or
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:55.800] sees
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.240] into
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.400] what
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:56.520] a
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:56.700] person
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.140] does.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:57.920] So
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.880] ideas
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.060] of
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.920] representations
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.160] or
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.420] knowledge
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:00.600] in
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:00.720] the
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.020] mind
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:01.160] or
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:01.280] in
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:01.380] the
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:01.640] brain
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:01.860] later
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.160] on,
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:02.580] and
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:02.740] how
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:02.880] that
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.360] translates
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:03.640] what's
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:03.860] out
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.160] there
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.560] and
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:04.700] how
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:04.820] you
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.040] act
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.280] upon
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:05.560] it.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:06.760] So
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.640] I'll
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:08.800] remind
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:08.880] you
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:08.960] a
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.060] couple
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:09.220] more
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:09.420] things,
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:09.520] then
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:09.620] we'll
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:09.720] get
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.060] to
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.480] specifics.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:11.160] So
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.060] correlations
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:12.320] are,
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:12.800] you
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:12.940] can
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.140] only
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.380] get
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:13.540] in
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:13.660] an
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.040] experiment,
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:14.400] right,
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:14.520] where
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:14.580] you
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:14.620] have
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:14.720] an
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.040] independent
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.600] variable.
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:16.740] Sorry,
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.380] correlations
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:17.500] you
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:17.600] can
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:17.700] look
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:17.760] at
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:17.880] all
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:17.940] the
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.140] time.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.300] Experiments
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:19.580] only.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:19.980] Experiments
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:20.260] allows
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:20.420] us
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:20.540] to
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:20.720] infer
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.240] causation.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.020] So
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.400] let's
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:23.600] pick
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:23.760] an
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.100] example
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:24.340] that,
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:24.820] when
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:24.940] I
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:25.060] read
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:25.160] it,
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:25.400] struck
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:25.620] me
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:25.780] as
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.220] slightly
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:26.600] relevant.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:27.900] So
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.280] age
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:28.440] of
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:28.740] parent
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:28.920] and
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.120] risk
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.280] for
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:29.620] disease
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:29.740] in
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:29.860] a
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.220] child.
[00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:31.430] So
[00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.810] most
[00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:31.970] of
[00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:32.110] you
[00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.250] are
[00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:32.450] young
[00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.730] enough
[00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:32.930] that
[00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:33.090] you're
[00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:33.230] not
[00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.390] too
[00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.610] worried
[00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:33.830] about
[00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.010] this
[00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.190] yet.
[00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.330] And
[00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:34.390] you
[00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.470] have
[00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.590] no
[00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.770] reason
[00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:34.950] to
[00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:35.130] be.
[00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:35.590] But
[00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.750] for
[00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.990] those
[00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.130] of
[00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:36.270] us
[00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:36.370] who
[00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:36.450] are
[00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:36.550] in
[00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:36.730] my
[00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.170] generation
[00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:37.350] and
[00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.510] some
[00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.930] generations
[00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:38.310] back,
[00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:38.890] many
[00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.190] people
[00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.430] are
[00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.130] postponing
[00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.850] childbirth
[00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:41.850] as
[00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:41.950] they
[00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:42.090] do
[00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:42.270] their
[00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.630] careers
[00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.850] and
[00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:43.150] complete
[00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.470] different
[00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.930] tasks.
[00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.470] And
[00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.630] they're
[00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.850] getting
[00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:45.230] older.
[00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:45.410] And
[00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:45.610] parents
[00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:45.750] are
[00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.930] getting
[00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:46.170] older
[00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:46.270] and
[00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.370] older.
[00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:46.570] They
[00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.030] don't
[00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:47.150] only
[00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.430] seem
[00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.710] old.
[00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:47.970] They
[00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:48.150] are
[00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.350] old.
[00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:49.130] So
[00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.590] it's
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.000] the
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.220] case,
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:52.680] statistically,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.440] that
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:53.620] the
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:53.980] older
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.260] the
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:54.740] mother
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.120] is,
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:55.780] the
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.060] higher
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:56.240] the
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.460] risk
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:56.620] of
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:56.780] Down
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.100] syndrome.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:57.340] So
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:57.460] the
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:57.800] statistics
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.100] are,
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:58.220] if
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:58.340] a
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:58.640] mother's
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:58.840] age
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.080] 20
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:17:59.180] to
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:17:59.520] 24,
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:17:59.720] it's
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:17:59.980] very
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.300] rare
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.200] to
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:01.480] have
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:01.680] Down
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.040] syndrome.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:02.560] And
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:02.680] the
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:02.900] number
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.200] goes
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:03.400] up
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.040] dramatically
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:04.520] if
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:04.660] the
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:04.860] mother
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.060] is
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.540] over
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:05.780] age
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.180] 42.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.160] So
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.300] this
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:07.460] is
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:07.760] simple
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.380] observation
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:08.980] and
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:09.280] measurement.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.140] But
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.260] it's
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:10.500] something
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:10.660] a
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:10.800] lot
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:10.920] of
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.120] women
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.380] giving
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:11.700] birth
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:11.820] in
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:11.960] their
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.260] 30s
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:12.340] and
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:12.680] 40s
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:12.820] are
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.300] thinking
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:13.660] about
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.000] and
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.280] worrying
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:14.660] about.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:14.760] And
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.240] it's
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:15.340] a
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:15.540] thing
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:15.660] on
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:15.780] their
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.020] mind.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:17.900] Up
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.160] until
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:18.680] relatively
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.600] recently,
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.400] men
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:20.620] said,
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:20.920] oh,
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:21.340] it's
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:21.480] too
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:21.680] bad
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:21.800] for
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:21.980] those
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:22.220] women.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:22.440] But
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.120] no
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:23.400] problem
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:23.600] for
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:23.840] us.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:24.840] So
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:24.960] you
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.940] have
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.300] the
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:26.560] movie
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:26.840] star
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.220] who's
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:27.440] 90
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:27.680] years
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:27.860] old
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:27.960] and
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.160] marries
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.280] a
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:28.460] 20
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:28.600]-year
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:28.760]-old
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.060] actress,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:29.860] that
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.200] kind
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:30.300] of
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:30.520] model
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:30.660] that
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:30.740] you
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.880] see
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.000] all
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.100] the
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.280] time
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:31.400] in
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:31.440] the
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:31.620] news.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.140] Because
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:33.300] it
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:33.500] doesn't
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:33.700] matter
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:33.860] how
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.000] old
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.080] the
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.260] guy
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:34.420] is.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:34.600] Well,
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:34.700] it
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:34.880] turns
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.280] out
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:35.800] it
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:35.960] does
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.220] matter.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:37.460] And
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:37.660] here's
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:37.780] some
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:37.980] data
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.200] for
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.440] that.
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.240] So
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:39.540] here's
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:39.640] the
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:39.960] probability
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.360] of
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.040] developing
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.960] schizophrenia,
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:43.300] a
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:43.620] disease
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.220] that's
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:44.540] typically
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.140] diagnosed
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.760] in
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:45.860] a
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.160] person's
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:46.420] late
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.040] adolescence
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.400] or
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.060] 20s,
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:48.840] depending
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.200] on
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.460] the
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:49.960] age
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.080] of
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:50.200] the
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.520] father.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.200] And
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:51.300] you
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:51.400] can
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:51.500] see
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:51.580] if
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:51.700] the
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:51.940] father
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:52.120] is
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:52.360] less
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:52.480] than
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:52.920] 25,
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.380] it's
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:53.760] 1
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:53.920] out
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.040] of
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.000] 141.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:55.960] If
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.100] the
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.340] father
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:56.640] is
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:56.840] in
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:56.980] his
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.600] 50s,
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:57.960] it
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.220] becomes
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:58.500] 1
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:58.660] out
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:58.760] of
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.060] 50,
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:18:59.320] a
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:18:59.840] dramatic
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.280] growth
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:00.440] in
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:00.640] the
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.080] likelihood
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:01.740] of
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:01.940] an
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:02.280] offspring
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:02.820] child
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.520] having
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.040] schizophrenia
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:04.940] depending
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.160] on
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.320] the
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:05.520] age
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:05.620] of
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:05.720] the
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.000] father.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.320] Now,
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.040] there's
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:10.140] a
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:10.420] correlation
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:10.820] between
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.360] age
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:11.840] and
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.380] whether
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:12.580] a
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:12.840] child
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.740] expresses
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.280] schizophrenia.
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:14.900] So
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.200] let's
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.840] guess
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.200] about
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360] the
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.300] possible
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:18.780] causes
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.000] of
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:19.160] that.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:19.680] I
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:19.800] can
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.000] tell
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.120] you
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:20.300] it's
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:20.700] unknown.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.220] But
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:21.360] let's
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:21.520] even
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:21.820] begin
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.000] to
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.180] guess
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:22.380] about
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:22.560] it.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.000] Let
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.080] me
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:25.240] ask
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:25.320] you
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.440] to
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:25.580] guess
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:25.740] about
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:25.940] it.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.000] Yeah?
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:33.420] AUDIENCE
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:33.440] MEMBER
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:33.440] 2.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.380] Damage
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:35.600] by
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:35.800] age,
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.020] not
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.160] to
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.320] the
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:36.540] left.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.140] PROFESSOR
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:38.140] JOHN
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:38.140] GUTTAGE
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:38.140] Yeah,
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:38.560] bad
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:38.920] sperm,
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.160] for
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.660] some
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:41.860] reason
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.040] in
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:42.260] some
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:42.560] way,
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.140] and
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:43.440] sperm
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:43.700] that
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:43.980] leads
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.220] more
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:44.600] likely
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:44.980] to
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.100] be
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:45.340] risk
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:45.500] for
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:45.900] schizophrenia.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:46.420] So
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.780] that's
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:47.880] your
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.120] first
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.520] intuition.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:48.860] And
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.020] that
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.220] may
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:49.420] turn
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:49.580] out
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:49.740] to
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:49.860] be
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.020] right,
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.000] something
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.440] problematic
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:51.820] about
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.020] the
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:52.200] sperm
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.400] from
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:52.500] the
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:52.660] male.
[00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.110] Here's
[00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.330] another
[00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.610] one,
[00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:56.770] though.
[00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.950] And
[00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:57.110] this
[00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.350] shows
[00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.530] you
[00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.630] the
[00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:02.190] challenges
[00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.590] with
[00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.830] correlational
[00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:04.130] research
[00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.310] on
[00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.550] something
[00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:04.750] even
[00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.930] so
[00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:05.210] important
[00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.350] as
[00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.570] this,
[00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.710] which
[00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.910] is,
[00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.070] how
[00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.210] about
[00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:06.470] an
[00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.810] alternative,
[00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:07.090] which
[00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:07.270] is,
[00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:08.050] who
[00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:08.650] marries
[00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.310] later
[00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.530] in
[00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:09.770] life?
[00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:13.250] Maybe
[00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.430] the
[00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.810] desirable
[00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:14.070] men
[00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.190] are
[00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.530] plucked
[00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:14.670] off
[00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:14.790] the
[00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.050] market,
[00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.390] on
[00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.710] average,
[00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:15.870] in
[00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:16.090] large
[00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:16.510] statistics,
[00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:17.030] by
[00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:17.250] age
[00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:17.530] 30
[00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:17.690] or
[00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.970] something.
[00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:18.810] And
[00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:18.930] a
[00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:19.090] bunch
[00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:19.250] of
[00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:19.390] us,
[00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:19.490] and
[00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.630] I'm
[00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.710] a
[00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.870] late
[00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:20.270] marrier,
[00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.090] limp
[00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:21.290] to
[00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:21.510] find
[00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.770] some
[00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:22.010] woman
[00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.270] around
[00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.450] the
[00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:22.630] world
[00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.770] who
[00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:22.870] will
[00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:23.150] accept
[00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.450] us.
[00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:24.470] And
[00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.950] finally,
[00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.530] out
[00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:25.650] of
[00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:25.950] pity,
[00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.230] some
[00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.410] woman
[00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:26.590] says,
[00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.910] OK,
[00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:27.710] drag
[00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:28.250] yourself
[00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.530] into
[00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:28.750] your
[00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.190] 50s,
[00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.310] and
[00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.030] I'll
[00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:30.310] take
[00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.510] you.
[00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:32.930] So
[00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:33.370] right?
[00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.650] Because
[00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.910] it's
[00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:34.110] not
[00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.410] random,
[00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.870] probably.
[00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:35.770] We're
[00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:36.130] averaging
[00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.410] over
[00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:36.690] many
[00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:36.970] people.
[00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:37.150] But
[00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:37.290] it's
[00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:37.490] not
[00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.830] random,
[00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:38.310] probably,
[00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.750] who
[00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.070] marries
[00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.210] at
[00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:39.670] 25
[00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:39.990] in
[00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.090] a
[00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.230] given
[00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.630] society,
[00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:40.790] and
[00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:40.910] who
[00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:41.190] marriages
[00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.350] at
[00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.630] 50.
[00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:41.850] It's
[00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:42.050] not
[00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:42.350] random.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:43.500] It
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:43.900] could
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.000] be
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.240] big
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:44.560] differences.
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:45.780] And
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:45.920] how
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.060] could
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:46.180] we
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:46.340] tell
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:46.480] that
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:46.760] difference?
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.020] Maybe
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:47.140] it's
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.360] nothing
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:47.520] to
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:47.620] do
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:47.760] with
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:47.860] the
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.080] sperm.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.540] Maybe
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:48.720] it's
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:48.940] something
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.140] to
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.400] do
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:49.840] with
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.580] something
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.080] about
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.320] the
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:51.760] genes
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:51.940] and
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.440] environment
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:52.880] that
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.060] goes
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.260] with
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.320] being
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:54.560] a
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:54.800] parent
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:54.960] in
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.080] your
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.560] 50s
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:55.740] versus
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.000] being
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.140] a
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:56.320] parent
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:56.460] in
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:56.580] your
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.080] 20s.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:57.940] Completely
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.340] different
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:58.860] explanations.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:20:59.740] Someday,
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.000] maybe
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:00.200] we'll
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:00.480] know,
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.160] but
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.300] we
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:01.480] don't
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:01.640] know
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:01.940] now.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:02.560] So
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:02.700] this
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:02.800] is
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:02.900] the
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.100] limits
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.220] of
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:03.740] correlations.
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:04.020] And
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:04.660] both
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:04.800] could
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:04.900] be
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.100] true.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.400] Neither
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:05.580] could
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:05.700] be
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:05.780] a
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.100] third
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:06.340] story
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:06.700] altogether.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:08.500] So
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:08.600] that
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:08.720] was
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:08.900] about
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.200] me,
[00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.110] my
[00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.370] becoming
[00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:11.570] a
[00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.870] parent
[00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:12.590] late
[00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.690] in
[00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:12.870] life
[00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.970] and
[00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:13.110] marrying
[00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.330] late
[00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:13.430] in
[00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.610] life.
[00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.970] Let's
[00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:14.110] talk
[00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.290] about
[00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:14.530] you.
[00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.510] So
[00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.610] let's
[00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:15.750] talk
[00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.910] about
[00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:16.090] the
[00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:16.330] level
[00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:16.490] of
[00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:16.910] stress
[00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:17.110] you
[00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.570] have
[00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:18.010] and
[00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:18.210] how
[00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:18.770] empathetic
[00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.990] you
[00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.270] are,
[00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.690] on
[00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.210] average,
[00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:20.850] your
[00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:21.270] college
[00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.930] generation
[00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.550] relative
[00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:22.850] to
[00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:23.090] ones
[00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.450] five
[00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.590] or
[00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.790] 10
[00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:23.930] or
[00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:24.150] 20
[00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:24.430] years
[00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.670] ago.
[00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.550] So
[00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:25.770] let's
[00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:25.970] ask
[00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:26.110] that
[00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.350] question.
[00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:26.570] Why
[00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:26.730] would
[00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:26.950] people
[00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:27.350] want
[00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.490] to
[00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:27.630] know
[00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.810] such
[00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:27.950] a
[00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:28.130] thing?
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.280] Well,
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:32.380] you
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:32.520] might
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:32.680] want
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:32.760] to
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.080] understand,
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.020] what
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:34.800] pressures
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:34.960] are
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.080] we
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.380] putting
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.200] young
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.500] people
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:36.840] under
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.380] as
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.520] they
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:37.720] go
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:37.960] through
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.260] grade
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:38.640] school

[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.240] college?
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:41.020] What's
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.160] the
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:41.400] world
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:41.620] like?
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:41.720] Is
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:41.860] it
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.060] pretty
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:42.260] much
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:42.400] the
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:42.640] same?
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:42.780] Is
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:42.900] it
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.060] pretty
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.280] much
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:43.720] changing?
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:46.480] How
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:46.680] would
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:46.780] we
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:46.960] figure
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.160] that
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:47.240] out?
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:47.340] How
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:47.460] would
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:47.560] we
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:47.940] begin
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.200] to
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:48.400] measure
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.660] that?
[00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.950] It's
[00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:52.050] a
[00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:52.190] very
[00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.410] simple
[00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:52.790] question.
[00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.570] Are
[00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.770] you
[00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:54.070] more
[00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.530] stressed
[00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:54.970] than
[00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:55.230] people
[00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.510] 10

[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:00.480] And
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:00.600] are
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:00.720] you
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:00.940] more
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.100] or
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:01.260] less

[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:06.660] How
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:06.960] might
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.140] one

[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:07.700] kind
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:07.780] of
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:07.880] a
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.100] question?
[00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.730] Yeah?
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:11.780] Can
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:11.860] you
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.000] tell
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.120] a
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:12.240] little
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:12.360] bit
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:12.600] about
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.120] this
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.220] and
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:13.320] the
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:13.640] extent
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:13.800] to
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:13.940] which
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:14.000] you
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.120] think?
[00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:17.050] PROFESSOR
[00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.050] JOHN
[00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.050] GUTTAGEN
[00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.050] That
[00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.330] would
[00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.430] be
[00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.510] a
[00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.670] very
[00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:17.970] interesting
[00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:18.370] path.
[00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:19.330] It's
[00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:19.450] a
[00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:19.630] tough
[00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.950] research
[00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:20.290] path.
[00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.530] But
[00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:20.630] you're
[00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.730] right.
[00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:21.130] If
[00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:21.210] we
[00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:21.310] had
[00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.450] some
[00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:21.930] biological
[00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:22.450] signature
[00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:22.670] of
[00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:22.970] stress,
[00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.410] that
[00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:23.510] would
[00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.630] be
[00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.690] a
[00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:23.790] good
[00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:23.950] one.
[00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:24.070] But
[00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.710] let's
[00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.850] ask
[00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:24.990] this
[00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.230] question.
[00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:25.750] Let's
[00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.830] say
[00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.930] I
[00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:26.130] measured
[00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:26.490] everybody
[00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:26.690] in
[00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.850] here
[00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:26.950] and
[00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:27.070] got
[00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.230] your
[00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.550] average
[00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.030] stress
[00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.470] hormone
[00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.730] or
[00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:28.990] something
[00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.230] like
[00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.450] that.
[00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.010] Now,
[00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:30.310] what's
[00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.470] my
[00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.750] answer
[00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.050] about
[00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:31.350] whether
[00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.030] 10
[00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:32.350] years
[00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.690] ago,
[00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.490] people
[00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.630] were
[00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.810] more
[00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:34.930] or
[00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:35.090] less
[00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:35.410] stressed?
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:36.680] Yeah?
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:36.940] AUDIENCE
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:36.940] MEMBER
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:36.940] 2
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:36.940] If
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.340] you
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:37.560] look
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:37.680] at
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.180] suicide
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:38.760] rates.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.440] PROFESSOR
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.440] JOHN
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.440] GUTTAGEN
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.440] That
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.700] would
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:40.840] be
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:40.960] an
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.160] outcome,
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.600] sadly,
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:42.780] an
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.160] extreme
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.520] outcome
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:43.960] of
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.340] stress
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:44.500] of
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:44.620] a
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:44.880] kind.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:45.140] But
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:45.280] there's
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:45.380] a
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:45.540] lot
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:45.640] of
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:45.840] things
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:45.940] that
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.080] go
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:46.180] on.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:46.360] OK,
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.020] so
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:47.680] we
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:47.820] have
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:47.900] to
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.040] worry
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:48.220] about
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.400] two
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:48.760] things.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:49.440] One
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:49.600] thing
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:49.740] we
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.740] know
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:50.940] is,
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:51.220] let
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:51.300] me
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:51.420] ask
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:51.480] you
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:51.660] another
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:51.840] one.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.180] You
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:52.720] could
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.200] compare
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.200] your
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.600] level
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:54.800] of
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.200] stress
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:55.960] to

[00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.240] What
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:22:59.320] do
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:22:59.340] you
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:22:59.480] think
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:22:59.700] about
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.000] that?
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.020] No?
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:03.820] Yeah?

[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:07.300] Actually,
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:09.960] we

[00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:17.790] Yeah,
[00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:18.070] because

[00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.730] people
[00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.330] who
[00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.430] are
[00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:20.790] 30
[00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:20.930] or
[00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:21.170] 40
[00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:21.310] are
[00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.510] more
[00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.950] stressed
[00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:22.210] for
[00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:22.470] other
[00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.810] reasons.
[00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:23.230] Because
[00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.510] they
[00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.610] have
[00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:23.770] more
[00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:24.010] bills
[00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:24.190] and
[00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.530] mortgages
[00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:24.810] to
[00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:24.990] pay,
[00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:25.130] or
[00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.530] less
[00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:25.770] stress
[00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:25.930] for

[00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:26.550] or
[00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:26.830] whatever.
[00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:27.610] Maybe
[00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:27.790] that's
[00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:27.990] not
[00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.310] about

[00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.710] you're
[00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:29.910] in.
[00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:30.570] Maybe
[00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:30.790] it's
[00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:31.150] about
[00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:31.590] being
[00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.830] a
[00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.210] person

[00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.430] at
[00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.710] 40.
[00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.650] OK,
[00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.230] so
[00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.170] for
[00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:36.410] some
[00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:36.570] things,
[00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:36.650] you
[00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:36.790] get
[00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:36.970] some
[00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:37.210] luck.
[00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:37.810] And
[00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:38.830] you
[00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.970] have
[00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:39.050] it
[00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:39.130] in
[00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:39.230] your
[00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.310] hand.
[00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.450] So
[00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.270] here's
[00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.410] an

[00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.270] It's
[00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:49.390] a

[00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.290] it's
[00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:50.370] not

[00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:54.970] And
[00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:55.330] this
[00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:55.430] was

[00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:08.870] about

[00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.050] Yeah,
[00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.510] so
[00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.330] now,
[00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:13.770] it's
[00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:13.890] not
[00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:14.030] the

[00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.070] But
[00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.150] it's

[00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.490] more
[00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:20.830] stressed.
[00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:21.270] You
[00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:21.390] can
[00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.650] also
[00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:21.870] see

[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.400] And
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:30.540] it
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:30.840] may
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.000] be

[00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.130] So
[00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:49.510] you're
[00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.670] more

[00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.130] that
[00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:54.350] way
[00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.590] worse.
[00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.210] But
[00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:55.770] it's
[00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:55.930] something
[00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:56.070] to
[00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.230] think
[00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.430] about.
[00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:57.110] I
[00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.250] got
[00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:57.350] a
[00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.490] call
[00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:57.630] the
[00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:57.770] other
[00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.950] day
[00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:58.110] from
[00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.390] somebody
[00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.490] who
[00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.630] said,
[00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.390] there's
[00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.530] a
[00:24:59.530 --> 00:24:59.890] lot
[00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:00.030] of
[00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:00.590] curiosity
[00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.430] about
[00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.710] whether
[00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.950] the
[00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:02.290] shift
[00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:02.550] from
[00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:03.030] book
[00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:03.350] learning
[00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.550] and
[00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:03.870] book
[00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:04.230] reading
[00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.930] to
[00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:05.410] internet
[00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.290] worlds

[00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.290] Twitter
[00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:07.610] and
[00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.990] Facebook
[00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.670] worlds
[00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:09.090] are
[00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:09.650] fundamentally
[00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.090] changing
[00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:10.390] how
[00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.850] people
[00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:11.150] think.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:12.720] And
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:12.880] that
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.240] sounds
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:13.560] kind
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:13.660] of
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.060] possible.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.080] And
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:15.200] there
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:15.300] are
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:15.540] people
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:15.700] who
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:15.860] give
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.460] amazingly
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:16.920] entertaining
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.240] lectures
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:17.520] about
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:17.720] these
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:17.980] things.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.220] Scientifically,
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:20.700] it's
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.260] unbelievably
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:21.740] hard
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:21.900] to
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.160] imagine
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.380] how
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:22.520] we
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:22.640] would
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:22.920] ever
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.220] answer
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:23.460] that.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.180] So
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:24.380] I
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:24.520] get
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:24.600] an
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:24.800] occasional
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.040] phone
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:25.200] call
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:25.360] like,
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:25.860] what
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:26.280] do
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:26.840] neuroscientists
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:26.980] know
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.160] about
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.320] that?
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:27.860] What
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:28.040] could
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:28.180] they
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:28.320] know
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:28.520] about
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:28.680] it?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.280] Is
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:29.380] that
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:29.660] even
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:29.860] an
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.360] answerable
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:30.780] question?
[00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:32.390] If
[00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.510] I
[00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.690] take
[00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:32.930] you
[00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:33.330] now
[00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:33.490] and
[00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:33.630] say,
[00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:33.810] well,
[00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:33.990] you've
[00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.210] probably
[00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:34.530] done

[00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:37.110] and
[00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.430] compare
[00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.590] you
[00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.690] to
[00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:37.810] a

[00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:39.130] other
[00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:39.450] thing,
[00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:39.950] is
[00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:40.070] that
[00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.170] going
[00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:40.270] to
[00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:40.610] answer
[00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.010] the
[00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:41.350] question
[00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.590] of

[00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.470] you
[00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.750] think
[00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.010] about
[00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.490] ideas
[00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.950] given
[00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:44.130] the
[00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:44.310] world
[00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.470] you
[00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.670] live
[00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:44.970] in
[00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:45.350] versus
[00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.570] the
[00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:45.750] world
[00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.890] a
[00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:46.130] 50

[00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:46.610] lived
[00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.790] in?
[00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:47.510] No.
[00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:48.990] So
[00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.410] there's
[00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:49.490] just
[00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.630] a
[00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.750] lot
[00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.870] of
[00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:50.230] huge,
[00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.470] deep
[00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.810] things
[00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:51.110] about
[00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.550] changes
[00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:51.710] in
[00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.830] the
[00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.090] world
[00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:52.310] that
[00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.410] we
[00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:52.710] can't
[00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.890] even
[00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:53.210] begin
[00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.390] to
[00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.510] get
[00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.630] at.
[00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.870] Sometimes
[00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:54.070] we
[00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.190] get
[00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.450] lucky,
[00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.570] and
[00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:54.750] people
[00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.830] have
[00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.930] been
[00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:55.150] giving
[00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:55.490] some

[00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:56.130] measure
[00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:56.350] for
[00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.470] some

[00:25:59.540 --> 00:25:59.960] Empathy
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.380] by

[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:01.220] And
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:01.380] now,
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.160] I
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:02.720] wouldn't
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:02.900] fill
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:02.980] it
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.100] out
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:03.260] now,
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:03.400] but
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:03.480] you
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:03.580] can
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:03.740] take
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:03.860] a
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.000] look
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.160] just
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:04.280] to
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:04.380] get
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:04.480] a

[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.180] This

[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:09.580] It's

[00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:18.850] measures,
[00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.330] are
[00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:19.630] more
[00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:19.990] stressed
[00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.190] and
[00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:20.370] less
[00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:20.910] empathetic
[00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:21.190] towards
[00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.510] others.
[00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:22.230] And
[00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.410] those
[00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:22.550] things,
[00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:22.870] sorry.
[00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:24.890] And
[00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:25.130] those
[00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.310] things,
[00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.670] this
[00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:25.830] is
[00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:26.010] not
[00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:26.130] an
[00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:26.510] individual.
[00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.830] This
[00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.910] is
[00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:27.010] an
[00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:27.390] average,
[00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:27.670] right?
[00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:27.990] So
[00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.310] at
[00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.010] the
[00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:29.230] level
[00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.610] that
[00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:30.210] society
[00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:30.790] operates,
[00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:31.290] things
[00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:31.450] are
[00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:31.670] going
[00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:31.950] on
[00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:32.090] and
[00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:32.350] moving
[00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.730] for
[00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:32.950] some
[00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:33.210] reason.
[00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.470] By
[00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.610] the
[00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.790] way,
[00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:34.930] I
[00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:35.050] can
[00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:35.230] tell
[00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.330] you
[00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.490] that
[00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:35.690] when
[00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:36.010] I'm
[00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:36.410] stressed,
[00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:36.950] I
[00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:37.090] have
[00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:37.310] less
[00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.650] room
[00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:37.910] to
[00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:38.050] be
[00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:38.550] empathetic.
[00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:39.310] So
[00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.510] maybe
[00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.730] these
[00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:39.950] things
[00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:40.130] are
[00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.430] related.
[00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.570] If
[00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:40.670] you're
[00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:40.890] feeling
[00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:41.270] stressed,
[00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.590] your
[00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.790] first
[00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:41.990] thought
[00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.150] is
[00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:42.550] not
[00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:42.730] how
[00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:42.890] can
[00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.990] I
[00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.170] help
[00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:43.470] others,
[00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:43.630] but
[00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:44.050] how
[00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:44.210] can
[00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.290] I
[00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:44.430] just
[00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.570] get
[00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.710] through
[00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.830] the
[00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:45.070] day?
[00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:46.270] So
[00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:46.630] these
[00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:47.190] things
[00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.410] might
[00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:47.550] be
[00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:47.830] related.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.220] So
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:49.440] let's
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:49.560] turn
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:49.660] a
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:49.780] little
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:49.940] bit
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.080] to
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.720] experimentation
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.860] and
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.920] some
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.000] of
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.100] the
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:54.500] challenges
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:54.680] of
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.040] relating
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.200] psychology
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.600] to
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.020] real
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:57.480] world
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.080] policies
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:58.500] that
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:58.600] are
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:58.780] meant
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:58.920] to
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.040] make
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.160] the
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:26:59.340] world
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:26:59.620] better
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:26:59.800] or
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.020] safer
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:00.180] in
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:00.360] some
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:00.560] way.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:01.440] So
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:01.620] there's
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:01.780] a
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.100] famous
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:02.580] broken
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:02.880] window
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.180] theory
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:03.340] from
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:03.460] the
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:03.740] political
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:04.160] scientist
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:04.500] James
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:04.840] Wilson
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:04.980] and
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:05.040] the
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.480] criminologist
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:05.820] George
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.100] Killing.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:06.260] And
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:06.380] their
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:06.680] idea
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.000] was
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.320] this,
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:08.180] that
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:08.540] especially
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:08.880] in
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.300] neighborhoods
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:09.600] that
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:09.700] are
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.040] not
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:10.780] immaculately
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:11.180] kept,
[00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:12.270] or
[00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:12.610] to
[00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:12.750] say
[00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.830] it
[00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.910] the
[00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:13.050] other
[00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:13.250] way,
[00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:13.510] where
[00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.650] there's
[00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:13.790] a
[00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:14.010] lot
[00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:14.170] of
[00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:14.570] damage
[00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.890] around
[00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:15.170] you,
[00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.590] things
[00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.730] like
[00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:16.010] broken
[00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.410] windows
[00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:16.590] is
[00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.750] the
[00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:17.030] phrase
[00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:17.190] they
[00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.510] used,
[00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.390] that
[00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:18.570] this
[00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:18.970] promotes
[00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:19.130] in
[00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.390] people
[00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:19.590] who
[00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.850] live
[00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:19.970] in
[00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:20.150] that
[00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:20.470] community
[00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.650] or
[00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:20.870] work
[00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:21.070] around
[00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.230] that
[00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.510] community
[00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.690] a
[00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:21.910] sense
[00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:22.130] that
[00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.730] the
[00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:23.130] rules
[00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:23.630] don't
[00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.930] count.
[00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.230] Anybody
[00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.510] can
[00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:24.670] do
[00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:24.970] anything.
[00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.870] And
[00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:26.070] then
[00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.470] it
[00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.870] fosters
[00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:27.090] the
[00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:27.250] growth
[00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:27.410] of
[00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:27.610] petty
[00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:28.110] crimes.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.340] And
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:29.560] once
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:29.640] you
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:29.740] do
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:29.840] a
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.000] petty
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.320] crime,
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:30.500] you're
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:30.640] more
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.080] vulnerable
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.560] or
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:31.800] willing
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:31.940] to
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:32.080] do
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:32.180] a
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:32.380] major
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:32.760] crime,
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.180] a
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:33.540] slippery
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.020] slope.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:35.860] And
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.060] in
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:36.500] fact,
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.820] Rudy
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.340] Giuliani
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:40.780] and
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:41.160] Commissioner
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:41.380] Bill
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:41.760] Bretton
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.440] employed
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:42.620] this.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:42.740] They
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.220] asked
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:43.420] the
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:43.800] police
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.140] to
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:44.320] write
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:44.800] lots
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:44.980] of
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.380] tickets
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:45.960] and
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.140] make
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:46.380] lots
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:46.520] of
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:46.620] sort
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:46.700] of
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:46.980] minor
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:47.500] arrests
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.020] for
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:48.340] things
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:48.480] where
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:48.720] people
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.160] weren't
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:49.700] upkeeping
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.360] the
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:50.800] environment,
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:50.980] or
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:51.080] where
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:51.200] they
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:51.340] were
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:51.840] littering,
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:52.140] or
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:52.340] things
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:52.500] like
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:52.720] that.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:53.500] And
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:53.620] this
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:53.700] is
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:53.820] a
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.000] huge
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.260] debate,
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:54.400] because
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:54.500] in
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:54.620] a
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:54.860] police
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.240] department,
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:55.820] you
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:55.940] can
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.120] only
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:56.280] do
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:56.480] so
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:56.760] much.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:57.520] So
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:57.620] if
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.240] they
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:58.340] have
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:58.460] a
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:58.680] person
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.300] working
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:27:59.500] on
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.060] jaywalking
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:00.180] and
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:00.580] littering,
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.040] that's
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:01.120] a
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.320] person
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:01.560] not
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:01.840] working
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.040] on
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:02.600] major
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.280] crime
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:03.520] rings.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:03.940] So
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.300] they're
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:04.500] trying
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:04.580] to
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:04.700] make
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:04.800] a
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.080] choice
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:05.240] where
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.360] they
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:05.580] think
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.100] they
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:06.240] can
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.460] make
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.240] communities
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:07.640] safer
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.200] in
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:08.320] the
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:08.500] most
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:08.820] effective
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.200] way.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:09.860] And
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.000] the
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:10.400] crimes
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:10.720] went
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.160] way
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.440] down
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:11.560] in
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:11.680] New
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:11.840] York.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.060] In
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.400] most
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:12.640] cities
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:12.980] now,
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.160] you
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:14.640] don't
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:14.860] hear
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:15.360] crime
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:15.740] discussed
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.000] as
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.180] a
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.440] big
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:16.840] topic
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.360] nationally.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:18.040] In
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:18.220] some
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:18.620] local
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.000] areas,
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.220] like
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:19.380] in
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:19.700] Boston,
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:19.940] some
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:20.540] specific
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:20.920] areas
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.040] you
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.220] do.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:22.200] I
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.780] don't
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.180] think
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:23.660] in
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:23.780] the
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:23.920] State
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.020] of
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:24.100] the
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:24.240] Union
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:24.420] there
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:24.540] was
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:24.660] a
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:24.820] word
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.060] about
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:25.400] crime
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:25.540] that
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:25.660] I
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:25.760] can
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.180] remember
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:26.600] a
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:26.700] week
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:26.920] ago.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:27.340] It's
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:27.460] not
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:27.620] a
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:27.820] big
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.200] national
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.580] topic.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.020] In
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.240] some
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:29.540] local
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:29.940] places,
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.240] it
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:30.380] is
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:30.480] a
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:30.600] big
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:30.880] topic,
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.020] but
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:31.200] not
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:31.600] nationally.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:32.460] So
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:32.680] you
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:32.880] don't
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.280] know,
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.000] some
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.220] years
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:34.440] ago,
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:34.600] when
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:34.780] people
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:34.980] said
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.180] New
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:35.380] York
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:35.680] City
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.180] was
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:36.280] a
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:36.720] horrible
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.060] place
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.200] to
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:37.440] go
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:37.620] because
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:37.700] there
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:37.820] was
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.020] so
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:38.200] much
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:38.540] crime
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:38.900] that
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.100] you'd
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.360] walk
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:39.560] out
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:39.720] from
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:39.840] your
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.080] airplane
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:40.200] and
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.320] get
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:40.660] mugged
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:40.920] before
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.060] you
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:41.220] made
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:41.300] it
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:41.380] to
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:41.520] your
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:41.820] taxi.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:42.340] It
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:42.460] was
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.160] like
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:44.260] the
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:44.420] whole
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:44.680] country
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:44.820] was
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:44.960] saying
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.200] big
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.420] cities
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:45.580] were
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:45.740] just
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.320] crime
[00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.230]-ridden
[00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.430] and
[00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.810] dangerous.
[00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:49.450] They
[00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:49.590] do
[00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.790] this
[00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:50.230] policy,
[00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:50.610] things
[00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:50.770] get
[00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:51.070] better.
[00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.950] So
[00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:52.070] everybody
[00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.190] says,
[00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:52.430] hmm,
[00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:52.590] that
[00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.790] sounds
[00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:53.010] pretty
[00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:53.230] good.
[00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:53.390] But
[00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.530] of
[00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:53.650] course,
[00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:53.770] it's
[00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:53.890] not
[00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:54.010] an
[00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:54.410] experiment.
[00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:54.690] It's
[00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:54.770] a
[00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:54.910] real
[00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:55.090]-life
[00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:55.570] policy.
[00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.330] And
[00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.470] then
[00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.730] people
[00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:56.970] had
[00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.250] these
[00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.710] incredibly
[00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.290] clever
[00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:00.650] reinterpretations
[00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:00.850] of
[00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:01.350] why
[00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.990] crime
[00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.430] went
[00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.790] down.
[00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:03.630] So
[00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:04.210] the
[00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.910] wildest
[00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.110] one
[00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.350] was
[00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.530] in
[00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:07.130] Freakonomics,
[00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.270] which
[00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:07.290] was
[00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:07.610] discussed
[00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.730] in
[00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.910] that,
[00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.970] which
[00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:09.110] said,
[00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:09.250] well,
[00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.670] abortion
[00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:09.910] was
[00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:10.310] legalized
[00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.430] in
[00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.090] 1973.
[00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:12.230] That
[00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.510] gave
[00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:12.790] women
[00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:12.990] who
[00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.250] didn't

[00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:15.210] abortions
[00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:15.910] the
[00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:16.170] ability
[00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:16.550] to
[00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:18.070] have
[00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.290] them.
[00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:18.850] That
[00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:19.210] children,
[00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:19.770] on

[00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:20.350] in
[00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.490] these
[00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:20.850] communities,
[00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.050] had
[00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:21.230] at
[00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.410] least
[00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:21.870] access

[00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.250] abortions,
[00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:23.670] would
[00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:23.810] be
[00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:24.090] poor
[00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:24.250] and
[00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:24.650] unstable,
[00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:25.530] addiction

[00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:26.350] communities,
[00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.190] statistically.
[00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:28.790] And
[00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:29.070] so
[00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.350] that
[00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.870] if
[00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.990] you
[00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.470] imagine
[00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.710] the
[00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.350] reduced
[00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.910] abortion
[00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:32.290] rate
[00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:32.470] in

[00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:33.290] areas
[00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.150] could,
[00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.510] when
[00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:34.650] you
[00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:34.970] count
[00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:35.150] out
[00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:35.310] the

[00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.330] of
[00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:36.910] possible
[00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:37.690] criminals
[00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:37.930] in
[00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:38.090] those
[00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.410] areas,
[00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:39.370] account
[00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:39.570] for
[00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:39.670] the
[00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:39.950] reduction
[00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:40.130] in
[00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.350] crime
[00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.630] all
[00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.770] by
[00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:41.130] itself.
[00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.650] A
[00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:42.210] completely
[00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:42.870] different
[00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:43.390] interpretation
[00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:43.970] that
[00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:44.110] has
[00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.570] nothing
[00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:44.790] to
[00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:45.090] do
[00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:45.490] with
[00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:45.610] the
[00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:46.030] policy.
[00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:46.250] It
[00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:46.490] just
[00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.830] said,
[00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:47.570] we're
[00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.590] going
[00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.630] to
[00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.730] have
[00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:47.870] a
[00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:48.390] demographic
[00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:48.970] shift,
[00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:50.050] which
[00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:50.210] will
[00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:50.590] have
[00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.830] a
[00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:51.230] weird,
[00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:51.910] unexpected
[00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:52.570] consequence
[00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:53.230] of
[00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.590] lowering
[00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.790] the
[00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.090] crime
[00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:54.330] rate.
[00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:55.210] Because
[00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:55.530] it's
[00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:55.690] the
[00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:56.030] finding
[00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:56.510] that
[00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.650] young
[00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:57.950] men,
[00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:58.110] in
[00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.530] particular,
[00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.830] are
[00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.110] most
[00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.430] likely
[00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.650] to
[00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:00.010] engage
[00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:00.190] in
[00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.470] violent
[00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.710] criminal
[00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.110] activity.
[00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.270] It's
[00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:01.390] not
[00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:01.550] an
[00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.490] all
[00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:02.910] rule,
[00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:03.090] but
[00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:03.210] a
[00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:03.570] statistical
[00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:04.170] average.
[00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:05.270] Or
[00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.090] there
[00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:06.230] was
[00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.430] a
[00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.630] big
[00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.850] crack
[00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.190] academic
[00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:08.430] that
[00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.650] reduced.
[00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:09.270] Or
[00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:09.990] lots
[00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.110] of
[00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.350] states
[00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.570] put
[00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:10.730] in
[00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.090] laws
[00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.450] that
[00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:11.610] put
[00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:11.870] people
[00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:12.070] into
[00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.350] jail
[00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.570] for
[00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:12.850] much
[00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:13.230] higher,
[00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.730] longer
[00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:14.110] periods,
[00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.350] much
[00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.550] more
[00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:14.890] severe
[00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:15.290] penalties
[00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:16.130] with
[00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.290] new
[00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:16.490] drug
[00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.790] laws.
[00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.490] So
[00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:17.830] it's
[00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:18.210] very
[00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:18.490] hard
[00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:18.670] to
[00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:19.010] know
[00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.390] if
[00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:19.530] the
[00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:19.910] policy
[00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:20.090] that
[00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.230] was
[00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.610] initiated
[00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:20.930] really
[00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:21.510] worked,
[00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.930] or
[00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:22.110] whether
[00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.770] completely
[00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:23.050] other
[00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:23.270] things
[00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:23.390] were
[00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:23.770] happening
[00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:24.610] that
[00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:24.870] moved
[00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.990] the
[00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.210] crime
[00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:25.430] rate.
[00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:26.030] And
[00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:26.190] here's
[00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:26.330] some
[00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:26.670] very
[00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:27.930] perverse
[00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:28.170] or
[00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.390] other
[00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:29.870] explanations.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.020] So
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:31.200] that
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.380] left
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:31.500] the
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:31.780] question
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.060] is,
[00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.250] is
[00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:33.490] broken
[00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:33.810] windows
[00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.010] even
[00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.150] a
[00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:34.270] good
[00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:34.690] idea?
[00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.030] Just
[00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:35.390] because
[00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.010] a
[00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:36.310] Harvard,
[00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.630] and
[00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.710] we
[00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.810] know
[00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:37.070] Harvard
[00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.250] is
[00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:37.470] always
[00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.670] right.
[00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:38.030] But
[00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:38.150] just
[00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:38.330] because
[00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.430] a
[00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.630] Harvard
[00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:39.150] psychologist
[00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:39.430] says,
[00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.670] pretty
[00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:40.190] interestingly,
[00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.690] that
[00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:40.930] sounds
[00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:41.130] right
[00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.270] to
[00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:41.530] me,
[00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.810] is
[00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:41.930] that
[00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:42.090] even
[00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:42.250] a
[00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:42.430] right
[00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.910] idea?
[00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.790] So
[00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:43.930] let's
[00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:44.030] take
[00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:44.150] a
[00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:44.310] step
[00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.690] back.
[00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.310] Can
[00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.430] we
[00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.730] test
[00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.030] that
[00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:46.710] experimentally?
[00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:47.030] So
[00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:47.290] here's
[00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:47.390] the
[00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:47.770] experiment.
[00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.670] And
[00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:50.030] the
[00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:50.230] idea
[00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.350] is,
[00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.490] again,
[00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:50.630] that
[00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.750] when
[00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.970] people
[00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:51.190] observe
[00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.310] that
[00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.610] others
[00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:52.030] violate
[00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.190] a
[00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.430] social
[00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.850] norm
[00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:53.210] or
[00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.590] legitimate
[00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.990] rule,
[00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:54.210] are
[00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:54.350] they
[00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.530] more
[00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:54.750] likely
[00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.950] to
[00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:55.190] violate
[00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.310] it?
[00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.410] If
[00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:55.590] you
[00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.790] see
[00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:56.070] people
[00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.370] around
[00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:56.530] you
[00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:56.830] breaking
[00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:57.250] rules,
[00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.490] are
[00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:57.610] you
[00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:57.790] more
[00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.010] likely
[00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.190] to
[00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.310] do
[00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.450] it?
[00:30:59.410 --> 00:30:59.770] And
[00:30:59.770 --> 00:30:59.870] you
[00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.970] could
[00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:00.110] say,
[00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:00.270] it
[00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:00.450] seems
[00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:00.630] like
[00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.750] it
[00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.910] is,
[00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:01.050] but
[00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:01.690] let's
[00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:01.790] do
[00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:01.930] the
[00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:02.250] science.
[00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:03.050] So
[00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:03.390] here's
[00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:03.490] an
[00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:03.850] independent
[00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:04.210] measure.
[00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:04.350] I'll
[00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.530] show
[00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:04.630] you
[00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.770] the
[00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:05.210] environment.
[00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.750] The
[00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:06.090] dependent
[00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:06.490] measure
[00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:06.650] is
[00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:06.750] the
[00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.970] number
[00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:07.150] of
[00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:07.350] people
[00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.530] who
[00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:07.870] perform
[00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:08.010] a
[00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:08.370] violation.
[00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:08.610] Now,
[00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:08.730] you
[00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:08.970] can't
[00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:09.150] go
[00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:09.370] getting
[00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:09.670] people
[00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.170] murdering
[00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:10.350] each
[00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.530] other
[00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:10.630] and
[00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.810] stuff
[00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:10.890] for
[00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:10.950] an
[00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:11.250] experiment.
[00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.610] But
[00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:11.690] you
[00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:11.810] can
[00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.950] do
[00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:12.250] this.
[00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:13.650] You
[00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:13.770] can
[00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:13.890] have
[00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:14.030] two
[00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:14.430] conditions.
[00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:14.590] On
[00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.710] the
[00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.990] top
[00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.410] condition,
[00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:15.930] do
[00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:15.990] you
[00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.130] ever
[00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.450] go
[00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:16.670] back
[00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:16.790] to
[00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:16.930] your
[00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:17.250] car
[00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:17.470] or
[00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.790] bike?
[00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:18.070] Usually
[00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.210] it's
[00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:18.430] cars,
[00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:18.570] I
[00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:18.690] think.
[00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:18.930] And
[00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:18.990] they
[00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.130] put
[00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.430] leaflets
[00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.570] in
[00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:19.690] your
[00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:19.950] car.
[00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.310] And
[00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.430] now
[00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.550] what
[00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:20.590] are
[00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.670] you
[00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:20.750] going
[00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.830] to
[00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:21.010] do?
[00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.250] You're
[00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:21.450] running
[00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:21.730] away
[00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:21.870] with
[00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:21.970] a
[00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:22.510] leaflet
[00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:22.650] on
[00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:22.790] your
[00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:23.070] windshield
[00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.690] wiper.
[00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:24.730] So
[00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:24.910] they
[00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:25.430] put
[00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.530] it
[00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:25.690] out.
[00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.830] And
[00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.910] they
[00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:26.030] either
[00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.150] had
[00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:26.310] a
[00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.590] wall
[00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:26.890] like
[00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:27.290] this,
[00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:27.510] which
[00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:27.670] was
[00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.090] clean.
[00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:28.310] There's
[00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.430] a
[00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.630] sign
[00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.810] that
[00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:28.970] says,
[00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:29.150] no
[00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:29.530] graffiti.
[00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:30.410] And
[00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:30.530] they
[00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:30.710] put
[00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.970] on
[00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:31.150] those
[00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:31.370] white
[00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:31.590] pieces
[00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.750] of
[00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.990] paper
[00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.230] onto
[00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.430] the
[00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.710] bikes.
[00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:33.730] Or
[00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.050] they
[00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:34.210] put
[00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:34.330] a
[00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:34.470] lot
[00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.570] of
[00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:34.810] graffiti
[00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:35.050] on
[00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:35.170] the
[00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:35.430] wall.
[00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:36.870] And
[00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:37.190] people
[00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.430] came
[00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.570] out
[00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:37.730] from
[00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.870] their
[00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:38.230] classes.
[00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.430] They
[00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.570] went
[00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.670] in
[00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:38.770] their
[00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:39.030] glasses.
[00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:39.430] They
[00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.050] parked
[00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:40.190] their
[00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.370] bike.
[00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:40.510] They
[00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:40.690] ran
[00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:40.830] into
[00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:41.070] class.
[00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.190] They
[00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.390] came
[00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:41.630] out.
[00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:42.010] And
[00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:42.130] they
[00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:42.310] got
[00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.430] all
[00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:42.550] these
[00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:42.730] white
[00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:43.030] leaflets.
[00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:43.410] And
[00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:43.530] what
[00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:43.670] they
[00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:43.810] did
[00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:43.950] is
[00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:44.390] watched.
[00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:45.070] And
[00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.170] they
[00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:45.310] said,
[00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:45.510] how
[00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:45.730] many
[00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:45.990] people
[00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.230] put
[00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.410] the
[00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:46.750] leaflet
[00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.250] away?
[00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.030] And
[00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:48.150] how
[00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:48.290] many
[00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:48.490] people
[00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:48.830] crumpled
[00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.970] it
[00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:49.110] up
[00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.210] and
[00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:49.330] threw
[00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:49.410] it
[00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:49.610] right
[00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.710] on
[00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.810] the
[00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:50.050] ground?
[00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:51.670] So
[00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:51.950] we
[00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:52.070] don't
[00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.250] know
[00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:52.370] what
[00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.470] they're
[00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.570] going
[00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:52.610] to
[00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.730] do
[00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:52.850] with
[00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.970] the
[00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:53.190] leaflet
[00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.290] if
[00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:53.350] they
[00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.490] put
[00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:53.570] it
[00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.710] away.
[00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:53.850] But
[00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:53.970] we
[00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:54.070] could
[00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.270] hope
[00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:54.410] they're
[00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:54.490] going
[00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:54.570] to
[00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:54.710] throw
[00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.830] it
[00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:55.010] out.
[00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.730] One
[00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:55.850] thing
[00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.950] we
[00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:56.050] know
[00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:56.190] for
[00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.350] sure,
[00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:56.470] if
[00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.570] you
[00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.770] crumple
[00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:56.890] it
[00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:56.990] up
[00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.090] and
[00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:57.210] throw
[00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:57.310] it
[00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.370] on
[00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:57.450] the
[00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:57.630] ground,
[00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.810] it's
[00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:58.170] littering
[00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:58.290] and
[00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:58.650] not
[00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:58.750] a
[00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:58.850] good
[00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:59.110] social
[00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.370] norm.
[00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.950] And
[00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:00.330] sure
[00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:00.610] enough,
[00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.810] a
[00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:01.950] third
[00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:02.050] of
[00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:02.150] the
[00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:02.390] people
[00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.490] littered
[00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:04.010] if
[00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.170] the
[00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:04.370] wall
[00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.550] had
[00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:04.710] no
[00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:05.050] graffiti.
[00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.750] But
[00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.850] it
[00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:06.050] more
[00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:06.290] than
[00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:06.690] doubled
[00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.350] if
[00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.490] the
[00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.630] wall
[00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:07.790] had
[00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:08.110] graffiti.
[00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.710] So
[00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.890] that's
[00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:09.010] a
[00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:09.350] small
[00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.550] thing.
[00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:09.730] That's
[00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:09.810] not
[00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:09.930] a
[00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:10.210] broken
[00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:10.510] down,
[00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.990] complicated
[00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.350] neighborhood.
[00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.650] But
[00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:12.050] just
[00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:12.270] at
[00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:12.450] that
[00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:12.670] moment,
[00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:12.810] as
[00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:12.930] you
[00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:13.170] roar
[00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:13.330] out
[00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:13.430] of
[00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.690] class,
[00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:14.090] you
[00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.210] get
[00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.330] that
[00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:14.550] piece
[00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:14.690] of
[00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:14.910] paper
[00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:15.110] on
[00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.230] your
[00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.470] bike.
[00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:15.950] And
[00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:16.050] you
[00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:16.250] see,
[00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.750] wow,
[00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:17.010] this
[00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:17.110] is
[00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.190] a
[00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.310] pretty
[00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.510] crummy
[00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.750] place.
[00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:17.950] People
[00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:18.050] are
[00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:18.270] breaking
[00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:18.410] the
[00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:18.530] rules
[00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:18.670] all
[00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:18.750] the
[00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.990] time.
[00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.430] Twice
[00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.590] as
[00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.870] likely
[00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:20.350] to
[00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.490] throw
[00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:20.610] a
[00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:20.750] piece
[00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.890] of
[00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:21.110] paper
[00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.270] on
[00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:21.370] the
[00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:21.550] ground.
[00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:21.690] So
[00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:21.930] that
[00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:22.150] shows
[00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:22.290] that
[00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:22.490] people
[00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.830] very
[00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:23.230] easily
[00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.790] are
[00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.050] influenced
[00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:24.230] by
[00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.470] very
[00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.930] mild
[00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:25.890] perceptions
[00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:26.130] of
[00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:26.290] whether
[00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:26.550] people
[00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:26.690] are
[00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.950] following
[00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:27.210] rules
[00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:27.350] or
[00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.610] not.
[00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:28.070] And
[00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.210] will
[00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:28.610] be
[00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.730] their
[00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:29.010] better
[00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:29.390] selves
[00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:29.510] or
[00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.670] their
[00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:29.910] worse
[00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:30.270] selves,
[00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:30.810] depending
[00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:31.030] on
[00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:31.150] that
[00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:31.430] sense
[00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.610] of,
[00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.110] are
[00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.370] all
[00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:32.650] rules
[00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:32.970] on
[00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:33.630] or
[00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:33.770] are
[00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:34.010] all
[00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.250] rules
[00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.470] off?
[00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.950] And
[00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:35.070] there's
[00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.150] a
[00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:35.290] pretty
[00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:35.470] good
[00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:35.630] bet
[00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.750] they're
[00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.890] not
[00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:36.130] thinking
[00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:36.370] about
[00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:36.510] it.
[00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:37.250] They're
[00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:37.310] not
[00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.470] thinking,
[00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:37.650] they're
[00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:37.770] saying,
[00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:38.430] OK,
[00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.310] here's
[00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.790] littering.
[00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.970] Not
[00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:42.110] as
[00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.330] bad
[00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:42.450] as
[00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:42.650] killing
[00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:43.050] somebody.
[00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:44.110] Here's
[00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.190] the
[00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.490] wall.
[00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.710] Well,
[00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.830] there's
[00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:45.050] 30
[00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:45.250]%
[00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:45.650] graffiti.
[00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.950] I
[00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:46.010] mean,
[00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:46.170] nobody
[00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:46.410] does
[00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:46.590] that.
[00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.690] They
[00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:46.790] have
[00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:46.870] an
[00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:47.190] emotion
[00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.470] quick
[00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.930] response.
[00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.450] But
[00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:48.910] the
[00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:49.230] environment
[00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.490] makes
[00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.610] a
[00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:49.810] difference
[00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:49.950] in
[00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:50.090] that
[00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.390] regard.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:51.660] So
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:51.760] an
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.000] important
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.220] thing
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:52.520] about
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.760] studies
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:54.900] are
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:55.060] this.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:55.200] So
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:55.340] let
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:55.400] me
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:55.540] tell
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:55.600] you
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:55.720] about
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:55.880] this
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.020] one.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:56.580] Here's
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:56.660] a
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:56.840] study
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.100] to
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:57.280] look
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:57.400] at
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:57.600] a
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:57.780] drug
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:57.900] that
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:58.020] was
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:58.200] supposed
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.380] to
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:58.660] lower
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.200] mortality
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:32:59.540] from
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.160] coronary
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.460] artery
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:00.920] disease.
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.180] Those
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:01.320] who
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:01.480] took
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:01.600] the
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:01.760] drug,
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:01.980] 80
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.200]%
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:02.380] or
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:02.600] more,
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:02.780] because
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.000] people
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.500] follow
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:03.780] whether
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:03.940] you
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.140] take
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:04.280] the
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:04.460] drug.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:04.620] If
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:04.700] you
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:04.900] don't
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:05.040] take
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.160] the
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:05.300] drug,
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:05.480] of
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:05.680] course,
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:06.240] the
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:06.360] drug
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:06.520] won't
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:06.760] work.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:07.420] I
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:07.520] had
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:07.640] a
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:07.920] 15

[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:08.740] mortality
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.040] rate
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.240] within
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:09.560] five
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:09.820] years.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.220] Those
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:11.380] who
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:11.540] took
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:11.660] the
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:11.840] drug
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.200] less
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.360] than
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:12.580] 80
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:12.940]%
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.480] had
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:13.600] a

[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.340]%
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:14.740] mortality.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:14.980] So
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:15.060] you'd
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:15.200] say,
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:15.680] well,
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.080] 10
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:16.300]%
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:16.540] better
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:16.880] chance
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.020] of
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.340] living
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:17.760] for
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.040] five
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:18.340] years.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:18.680] That's
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:18.980] worth
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.220] it.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.160] The
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:21.380] nice
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:21.520] thing
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:21.620] is
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:21.720] they
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:21.800] had
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:21.920] a
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.220] placebo,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:22.620] and
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:22.740] there
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:22.880] was
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.160] no
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.680] difference
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.800] whatsoever
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.960] between
[00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.290] those
[00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:26.450] who
[00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:26.610] took
[00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:26.770] the
[00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:27.090] active
[00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:27.450] drug
[00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:27.610] and
[00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:27.790] those
[00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:27.910] who
[00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:28.050] took
[00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:28.190] the
[00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.490] placebo.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:29.900] The
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.240] difference
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:30.460] was
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.260] those
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:31.440] who
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:31.840] followed
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.080] the
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.600] instructions
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:32.940] to
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:33.140] take
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:33.300] the
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:33.560] pill
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.500] and
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:34.920] those
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.060] who
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:35.400] didn't.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:37.340] So
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:37.480] what
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:37.580] does
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:37.800] that
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.000] mean?
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:38.560] How
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:38.620] do
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:38.700] you
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:38.940] interpret
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:39.220] that?
[00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.670] It's
[00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:40.810] not
[00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:40.950] the
[00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:41.310] drug.
[00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:42.170] Yeah?
[00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:42.770] AUDIENCE
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.040] MEMBER
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.040] 2
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.040] It
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.220] means
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:45.360] it's
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:45.560] not
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:45.880] working
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.020] the
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:46.080] way
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:46.220] it's
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:46.300] supposed
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:46.300] to.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:46.420] PROFESSOR
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:46.420] JOHN
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:46.420] GUTTAGER
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:46.420] It
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.220] could
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:47.400] be
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:47.680] that.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:47.920] It
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.080] could
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:48.200] be
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:48.320] the
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:48.640] stress.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:49.520] It
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:49.660] could
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:49.800] be
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.060] that.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.080] Let
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:51.340] me
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:51.520] make
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:51.640] a
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:51.880] guess.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.180] There's
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:52.320] no
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:52.620] scientific
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:52.920] answer
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.080] to
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:53.280] this.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:54.080] People
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:54.260] who
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:54.460] tend
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:54.640] not
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:54.820] to
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.040] follow
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.420] instructions,
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:55.580] are
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:55.700] they
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:55.940] mostly
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.300] stressed
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:56.480] by
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:56.660] not
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:56.920] following
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.320] instructions?
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:58.480] No.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.160] Mostly,
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:33:59.520] the
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:33:59.800] intuition
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.100] is
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:00.320] they're
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:00.540] blowing
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:00.720] it
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.000] off.
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.160] They're
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:01.300] like,
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:01.580] yeah,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:01.780] that's
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:01.860] the
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.180] instructions,
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:02.440] but
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:02.540] I've
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:02.640] got
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:02.840] things
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:02.960] to
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.080] do
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:03.200] and
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:03.400] places
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:03.560] to
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:03.760] go.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:04.660] But
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:04.760] you
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:04.880] could
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.020] be
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.220] right.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:06.620] So
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:06.820] anyway,
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:07.080] the
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:07.320] idea
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:07.580] is
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.020] what
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:08.240] you
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:08.440] pick
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:08.620] up
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:08.800] are
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.180] people
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:09.320] who
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:09.560] try
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:09.680] to
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:09.880] take
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.040] care
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.160] of
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:10.520] themselves.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.340] They
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:11.500] have
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:11.960] a
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.180] health
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:12.620] condition.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:13.680] And
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:13.780] the
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:13.980] people
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.080] who
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:14.220] are
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:14.700] following
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:14.960] the
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.180] pill
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:15.620] instruction
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.480] are
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.160] probably
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.560] also
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.040] doing
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:19.180] the
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:19.340] best
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:19.480] they
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:19.620] can
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:19.740] in
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:19.900] terms
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.020] of
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.460] exercise,
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:21.520] diet,
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.240] all
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:22.460] the
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:22.760] things
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:22.920] they
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.040] could
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:23.320] do
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:23.740] to
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:24.080] maximize
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:24.360] their
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:24.580] health.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:25.960] And
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.100] they're
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:26.320] taking
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:26.500] their
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:26.780] placebo
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.000] or
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:27.160] they're
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:27.360] taking
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:27.540] the
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:27.700] drug,
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:27.860] they
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.000] don't
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.260] know.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.200] But
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:29.340] they're
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:29.580] doing
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:29.820] everything
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.020] they
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:30.200] can.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:30.500] And
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:30.660] the
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:30.920] people
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.020] who
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:31.120] are
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:31.360] blowing
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:31.680] off
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.040] stuff,
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.140] they're
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:33.240] the
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:33.380] ones
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:33.480] who
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:33.480] are
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:33.620] doing
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:33.780] all
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:33.860] the
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.020] things
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.120] that
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:34.240] aren't
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:34.460] healthy,
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:34.720] including
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:34.980] not
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:35.180] even
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:35.440] taking
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:35.620] your
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:35.840] pills.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.060] I
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:36.120] mean,
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:36.220] if
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:36.280] you
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:36.380] don't
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:36.520] even
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:36.720] take
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:36.860] your
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.140] pills,
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.280] exercise
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:38.560] is
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:38.820] work.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:39.380] Diet
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:39.560] is
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:39.800] work.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.380] Popping
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:40.560] a
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:40.760] pill
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.100] that's
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:41.220] been
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.440] handed
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:41.640] to
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.100] you
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:42.940] that
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:43.140] you're
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:43.320] told
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:43.540] might
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:43.760] help
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:43.940] you
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:44.080] is
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:44.580] probably
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:44.860] not
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.100] that
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:45.280] much
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:45.500] work.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:45.660] So
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.000] it's
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.180] what's
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:47.300] called
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:47.580] self
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:47.920]-selection
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.320] bias,
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:48.460] that
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:48.580] you
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:48.860] stand
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.180] out
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:49.600] if
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:49.820] you
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:50.360] tend
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:50.460] to
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:50.620] take
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:50.740] care
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:50.820] of
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.060] yourself
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.240] or
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:51.500] not.
[00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:53.970] OK.
[00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:54.790] So
[00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:55.090] when
[00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:55.210] we
[00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:55.370] run
[00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:55.810] experiments
[00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:55.970] at
[00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:56.370] universities
[00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:57.670] that
[00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.910] involve
[00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:58.330] people,
[00:34:58.690 --> 00:34:58.870] a
[00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:59.150] huge
[00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.390] issue
[00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.610] for
[00:34:59.610 --> 00:34:59.890] us
[00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:00.150] is
[00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.690] the
[00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:01.010] idea
[00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.150] is
[00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.330] this,
[00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:01.450] that
[00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:01.550] we
[00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.070] randomly
[00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:02.470] recruit
[00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.810] people.
[00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:03.170] And
[00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.270] we'll
[00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.430] come
[00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.570] back
[00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:03.670] to
[00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.810] this
[00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:03.910] in
[00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.970] a
[00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:04.190] moment.
[00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:04.850] That
[00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:04.970] we
[00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:05.530] randomly
[00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:05.890] assign
[00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:06.050] them
[00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.210] to
[00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:06.390] one
[00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.730] condition
[00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:06.870] or
[00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:07.050] another.
[00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.250] For
[00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.590] example,
[00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:07.990] the
[00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.330] placebo
[00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:08.810] condition
[00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.970] or
[00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:09.090] the
[00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:09.290] drug
[00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.650] condition,
[00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:09.750] or
[00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.850] we
[00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:10.230] randomly
[00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.590] assign
[00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:10.710] them
[00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.830] to
[00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:10.970] the
[00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:11.250] messy
[00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:11.890] wall
[00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:12.010] or
[00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:12.150] the
[00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.370] clean
[00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:12.670] wall.
[00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.490] We
[00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.850] discover
[00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:14.350] something
[00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:14.830] and
[00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:14.950] then
[00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:15.070] we
[00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:15.290] try
[00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:15.550] to
[00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:16.050] generalize
[00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:16.150] it
[00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.270] as
[00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.430] far
[00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.570] as
[00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:16.670] we
[00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.110] can
[00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:17.490] to
[00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:17.770] people
[00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:17.930] as
[00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:18.030] a
[00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.190] whole.
[00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.450] We've
[00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:18.710] discovered
[00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.990] something
[00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.450] fundamental
[00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:19.730] about
[00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:19.910] how
[00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:20.210] humans
[00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.550] work.
[00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.670] Generalizable
[00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:22.110] principles
[00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:22.270] of
[00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.450] human
[00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:22.670] mind
[00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.750] and
[00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.030] behavior.
[00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.970] So
[00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:24.110] what
[00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:24.350] really
[00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:24.690] happens
[00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:24.810] in
[00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:24.910] the
[00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:25.170] world?
[00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.870] And
[00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:26.330] you're
[00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:26.970] in
[00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:27.210] between
[00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:27.570] sort
[00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:27.630] of
[00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:27.750] the
[00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.010] best
[00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.370] possible
[00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:28.690] world
[00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:28.750] and
[00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.850] the
[00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:28.950] world
[00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:29.070] we
[00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:29.310] actually
[00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.510] live
[00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.650] in.
[00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:30.870] So
[00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:31.050] is
[00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:31.350] it
[00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.750] really
[00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.130] random
[00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:33.330] who
[00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:33.990] participates
[00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.150] in
[00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.550] research
[00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:35.110] studies
[00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:35.910] in
[00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:36.290] psychology
[00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.810] departments,
[00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:37.190] where
[00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.470] a
[00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.550] lot
[00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.630] of
[00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.710] the
[00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.910] research
[00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:38.110] gets
[00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:38.330] done?
[00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:38.510] Is
[00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.590] it
[00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:38.730] really
[00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:39.030] random?
[00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.250] No.
[00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.710] So
[00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.890] who
[00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:43.370] volunteers?
[00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:44.270] Have
[00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.410] any
[00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:44.510] of
[00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.610] you
[00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:44.910] volunteered
[00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:45.110] to
[00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:45.290] be
[00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.510] a
[00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.710] subject
[00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.870] in
[00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.990] an
[00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.250] experiment
[00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.550] anywhere?
[00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:48.970] OK.
[00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:49.590] So
[00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.850] it's
[00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:51.010] not
[00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:51.410] random.
[00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:51.970] It's
[00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:52.090] that
[00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:52.210] some
[00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:52.410] people,
[00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.930] they
[00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:53.650] either
[00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:53.830] need
[00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:53.930] to
[00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:54.070] make
[00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:54.170] a
[00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.310] few
[00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.550] books,
[00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:54.670] or
[00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.770] they're
[00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:54.970] very
[00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:55.290] curious
[00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:55.570] about
[00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:56.030] psychology,
[00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:56.310] or
[00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.430] they
[00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.590] have
[00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:56.730] a
[00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:56.970] friend
[00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:57.190] who's
[00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.290] in
[00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.690] psychology.
[00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:58.350] It's
[00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:58.510] not
[00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.730] random.
[00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.250] And
[00:35:59.250 --> 00:35:59.370] in
[00:35:59.370 --> 00:35:59.550] fact,
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.140] population
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.540] wide,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.000] people
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.200] have
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:02.620] said
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:02.780] that
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:03.180] psychology
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:03.420] can
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:03.500] be
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:03.780] described
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:03.960] as
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.240] weird

[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:04.800] for

[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:05.500] reason.
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:06.220] That
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:06.420] the

[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.280] findings
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:08.740] you'll
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.240] read
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.560] about

[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:11.700] but
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.240] everywhere,
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:13.220] are
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:13.720] from
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.120] nations
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:14.280] that
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:14.380] are

[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.180] relatively
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:17.520] rich
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.760] democracies.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.200] The
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:20.460] vast
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:20.800] majority
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.040] are

[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:22.680] They're
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.240] undergraduates
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:23.360] or
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:23.600] graduate
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:23.880] students

[00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:27.490] It's
[00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:27.630] been
[00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.950] estimated
[00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:28.170] if
[00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:28.330] you're

[00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:29.230] student,
[00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:29.470] you're

[00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:31.050] likely
[00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:31.270] to
[00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.530] show
[00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:31.770] up
[00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.170] in

[00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:33.790] experiment
[00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:34.370] than
[00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:34.550] if
[00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.790] you're
[00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:35.450] a

[00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:36.530] else
[00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.650] on
[00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:36.790] the

[00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:37.970] 4
[00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:38.430],000
[00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.850] times.
[00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:39.550] Because
[00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.190] why?
[00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.930] Because
[00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:41.230] it's
[00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.550] changing
[00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.710] a
[00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.830] little
[00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:42.030] bit.
[00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:42.210] But
[00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:42.470] for
[00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.750] many,
[00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.950] many
[00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:43.310] years,
[00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.370] a
[00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:44.930] huge
[00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:45.150] amount
[00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.290] of
[00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:45.530] research
[00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:45.770] happened
[00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.910] in
[00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:46.010] the
[00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.210] US
[00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:46.410] at
[00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.070] universities,
[00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.850] pretty
[00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:48.030] much
[00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.150] at
[00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.330] better
[00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:48.850] universities,
[00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:49.270] pretty
[00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.490] much
[00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:49.570] at
[00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:49.790] highly
[00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:50.130] selected
[00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:50.610] students.
[00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:53.030] And
[00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.190] then
[00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.370] we
[00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:53.570] never
[00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:53.910] publish
[00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:54.090] that.
[00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.190] We
[00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.430] never
[00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.750] say,
[00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.490] MIT
[00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:56.050] students
[00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:56.330] did
[00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:56.490] the
[00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:56.830] following
[00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:57.130] things.
[00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:57.350] People
[00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:57.450] just
[00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:57.550] go,
[00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.730] yeah,
[00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:57.990] MIT
[00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.390] students,
[00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.710] because
[00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.830] then
[00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:58.930] we
[00:36:58.930 --> 00:36:59.010] got
[00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.090] a
[00:36:59.090 --> 00:36:59.310] different
[00:36:59.310 --> 00:36:59.670] report
[00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.830] from
[00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:00.190] Stanford,
[00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:00.390] or
[00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.590] from
[00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:00.970] UMass,
[00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.070] or
[00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:01.230] from
[00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.490] Michigan,
[00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.630] or
[00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.870] Texas.
[00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:02.430] We
[00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.590] say,
[00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:02.750] no,
[00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.570] humans
[00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.410] did
[00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:04.550] an
[00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.930] experiment.
[00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:05.210] And
[00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.810] humans
[00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:06.110] are
[00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:06.290] like
[00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.550] this.
[00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:08.530] So
[00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:08.890] that
[00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:09.030] could
[00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.190] make
[00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.290] us,
[00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:09.990] it's
[00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.110] just
[00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:10.290] something
[00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:10.410] to
[00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:10.570] think
[00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:10.790] about
[00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.910] as
[00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:11.030] you
[00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.290] see
[00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:11.670] studies
[00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.810] and
[00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:11.970] stuff
[00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:12.090] like
[00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:12.170] that.
[00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.250] And
[00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:12.430] people
[00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.570] are
[00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:12.830] more
[00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:12.950] and
[00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:13.110] more
[00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:13.670] sensitized
[00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.790] to
[00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:14.090] that.
[00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:14.490] As
[00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:14.830] more
[00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:14.950] and
[00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:15.050] more
[00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.170] of
[00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.270] the
[00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.670] world
[00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.110] gets
[00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:16.490] somewhat
[00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.290] industrialized,
[00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:20.190] there's
[00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.350] more
[00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:20.430] and
[00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.510] more
[00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.850] research
[00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:21.050] around
[00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.190] the
[00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.350] world.
[00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.510] But
[00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.730] still,
[00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:21.910] the
[00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:22.190] vast
[00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.450] majority
[00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:22.630] of
[00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.970] findings
[00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:23.450] are
[00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.590] you
[00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:23.910] guys.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:26.640] Now,
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:27.440] that's
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:27.560] just
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:27.680] to
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:27.840] start
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.000] with
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.180] who's
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:28.280] in
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:28.380] the
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:28.640] subject
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.040] pool
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.220] or
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:29.340] the
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:29.620] participant
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:29.940] pool.
[00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:31.190] How
[00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.550] normal
[00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.730] are
[00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.870] you
[00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:32.030] when
[00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.130] you
[00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.250] do
[00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:32.350] an
[00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:32.730] experiment?
[00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:33.490] Are
[00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:33.610] you
[00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:33.790] like
[00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:34.170] yourself,
[00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:34.530] or
[00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:34.650] are
[00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:34.750] you
[00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.950] doing
[00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:35.150] weird
[00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.430] stuff?
[00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.570] And
[00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:35.830] people
[00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:36.190] use
[00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.430] this
[00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.670] idea
[00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:36.910] that
[00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:37.170] you're
[00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:37.330] really
[00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:37.710] weird
[00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.890] when
[00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:37.970] you
[00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:38.090] do
[00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:38.190] an
[00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.470] experiment,
[00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:38.650] in
[00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:38.890] another
[00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:39.210] sense,
[00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.710] because
[00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:40.010] you
[00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.150] don't
[00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.270] know
[00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.430] what's
[00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.570] going
[00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:40.870] on.
[00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:41.050] You're
[00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:41.230] following
[00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.710] instructions.
[00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:42.690] So
[00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:42.830] they
[00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:42.950] do
[00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:43.270] experiments
[00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.390] to
[00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.590] show
[00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:43.810] how
[00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:44.270] ridiculously
[00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.690] people
[00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:45.150] behave.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:46.400] When
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:46.520] they're
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:46.640] doing
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:46.780] an
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.040] experiment,
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:47.380] they
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:47.520] would
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:47.720] never
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:47.880] do
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:47.960] it.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.060] So
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.420] they
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:48.640] ask
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:48.740] them
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:48.840] to
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.160] come
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:49.280] in,
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:49.340] and
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:49.420] they
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:49.540] say,
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:49.780] would
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:49.880] you
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.000] fill
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.100] out
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:50.320] 200
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:50.740] sheets
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:50.880] of
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.040] paper
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:51.280] filled
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:51.440] with
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:51.680] random
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:51.920] digits,
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:52.300] add
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:52.440] them
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:52.940] pairwise,
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:53.400] and
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:53.980] I'll
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.120] come
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:54.320] back
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:54.400] in
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:54.500] a
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:54.620] few
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.000] hours.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:55.300] Now,
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:55.640] if
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:55.740] a
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:55.900] friend
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.140] asked
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:56.240] you
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:56.320] to
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:56.460] do
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:56.680] that,
[00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:57.810] add
[00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:58.210] random
[00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:58.410] digits
[00:37:58.410 --> 00:37:58.590] for
[00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:58.690] a
[00:37:58.690 --> 00:37:58.830] couple
[00:37:58.830 --> 00:37:59.210] hours,
[00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.650] you
[00:37:59.650 --> 00:37:59.730] would
[00:37:59.730 --> 00:37:59.850] say,
[00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:00.330] no,
[00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:00.610] thank
[00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:00.730] you.
[00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:02.070] I've
[00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:02.150] got
[00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.330] about
[00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:02.490] 8
[00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:02.690] million
[00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.970] better
[00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:03.190] things
[00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.310] to
[00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:03.430] do
[00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.570] than
[00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:03.810] that,
[00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:04.010] right?
[00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:04.350] I
[00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:04.530] could
[00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.010] multiply
[00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:05.350] random
[00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:05.570] digits
[00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:05.790] to
[00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.970] start
[00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:06.110] with.
[00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:07.690] But
[00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:07.910] people
[00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:08.070] will
[00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:08.150] do
[00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.230] it
[00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.350] for
[00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:08.790] hours,
[00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:09.070] because
[00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:09.190] they're
[00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.250] in
[00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:09.370] this
[00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:09.630] weird,
[00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:09.850] like,
[00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:10.910] that's
[00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.990] the
[00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.370] instruction,
[00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:11.570] and
[00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:11.770] that's
[00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:11.870] what
[00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.990] my
[00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.190] mission
[00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.390] is.
[00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:12.810] Or,
[00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:13.210] even
[00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:13.390] more
[00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.650] ridiculous,
[00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.850] they
[00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:14.050] pick
[00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:14.150] up
[00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.270] a
[00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.490] card
[00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:14.730] after
[00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:14.950] each
[00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:15.330] page.
[00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:15.650] They've
[00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:15.830] added
[00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:16.050] all
[00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:16.190] these
[00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.450] numbers
[00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:17.070] for
[00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:17.250] no
[00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:17.470] good
[00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.710] reason.
[00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.350] And
[00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:18.470] the
[00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.850] instruction
[00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:19.150] tells
[00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.270] them,
[00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:19.590] when
[00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:19.750] you've
[00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.890] done
[00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:20.030] the
[00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.250] page,
[00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:20.470] tear
[00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.610] the
[00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:20.810] page
[00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.950] up
[00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:21.090] into
[00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:21.410] 32
[00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.770] pieces.
[00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:22.030] And
[00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.170] here's
[00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:22.250] the
[00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.410] next
[00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:22.690] page,
[00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:22.810] and
[00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:23.070] the
[00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:23.230] next
[00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.390] page.
[00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:23.830] It's
[00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:24.330] obviously
[00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.110] fruitless
[00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:25.310] and
[00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.690] pointless,
[00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:26.530] ridiculously
[00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.010] so.
[00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:27.430] But
[00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.650] because
[00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.810] you're
[00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:27.950] in
[00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:28.090] an
[00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:28.370] experiment,
[00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:28.550] and
[00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.710] somebody
[00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:29.010] told
[00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:29.110] you
[00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:29.190] to
[00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.290] do
[00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:29.490] that,
[00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:30.030] you
[00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.230] just
[00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.470] keep
[00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.890] barreling
[00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:31.170] forward.
[00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.390] So
[00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.910] how
[00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:32.090] much
[00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:32.210] are
[00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.330] we,
[00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:32.430] or
[00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:32.570] who
[00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:32.750] we
[00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.970] are,
[00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.130] when
[00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:33.210] we
[00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:33.310] do
[00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:33.690] experiments
[00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:33.950] versus
[00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:34.250] people
[00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.510] following
[00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.710] weird
[00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.010] instructions?
[00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:35.170] And
[00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:35.270] we'll
[00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.410] come
[00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:35.550] back
[00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.630] to
[00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.770] that
[00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:35.850] in
[00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:35.990] some
[00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.290] serious
[00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.730] context.
[00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.750] That's
[00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.830] the
[00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:38.130] subjects.
[00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.310] How
[00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.450] about
[00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.970] experimenters?
[00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:39.530] Experimenters
[00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:39.690] are
[00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:40.050] never
[00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:40.770] objective.
[00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:41.030] We
[00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.290] try
[00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:41.430] to
[00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.650] be,
[00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.870] as
[00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:42.110] scientists,
[00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:42.310] as
[00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.570] objective
[00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:42.770] as
[00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:42.890] we
[00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:43.030] can.
[00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:44.370] We
[00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:44.690] believe
[00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:45.150] certain
[00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.610] hypotheses.
[00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.870] We
[00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:46.010] have
[00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.270] certain
[00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.630] goals.
[00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.250] We
[00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:47.710] recognize
[00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:48.250] results
[00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:48.410] that
[00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.510] would
[00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.650] be
[00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.910] super
[00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:49.250] exciting.
[00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:49.450] We
[00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:49.810] recognize
[00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:50.210] results
[00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.490] that
[00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:50.590] would
[00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:50.730] be
[00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:50.970] boring.
[00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.450] We're
[00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:52.770] humans,
[00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:53.010] too.
[00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:53.390] We
[00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.510] want
[00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.590] to
[00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:53.690] do
[00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.890] stuff
[00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:54.050] that
[00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.330] matters.
[00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.470] We
[00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.590] want
[00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:54.650] to
[00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.730] do
[00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:54.930] stuff
[00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:55.070] that
[00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:55.370] people
[00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:56.170] reward
[00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:56.330] us
[00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:56.490] for.
[00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:56.670] I
[00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.730] mean,
[00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:56.810] it's
[00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:56.950] just
[00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:57.150] human.
[00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.710] So
[00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:59.030] here's
[00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.130] a
[00:38:59.130 --> 00:38:59.550] lowest
[00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:00.030] case
[00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.770] example
[00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:01.190] of
[00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.550] how,
[00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:01.930] once
[00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:02.030] you're
[00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.130] an
[00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.650] experimenter,
[00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.790] you
[00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:03.130] produce
[00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:03.290] your
[00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.430] own
[00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.790] results.
[00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.350] And
[00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:04.630] believe
[00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.810] me,
[00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:04.990] it's
[00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.310] much
[00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:05.550] more
[00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.730] when
[00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:05.850] your
[00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:06.110] result
[00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:06.450] matters
[00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:06.630] for
[00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.870] things
[00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:07.130] like
[00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:08.010] your
[00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:08.330] career
[00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:08.770] advancement
[00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:09.050] or
[00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.470] your
[00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.810] status
[00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:09.990] in
[00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.090] the
[00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:10.290] field.
[00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.930] So
[00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:11.550] students
[00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.150] were
[00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.510] told
[00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.110] that
[00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:13.570] rats
[00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:13.770] were
[00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.010] either
[00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:14.370] maze
[00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:14.690] bright
[00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.890] or
[00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:15.090] maze
[00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:15.270] dull.
[00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:15.410] They
[00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.510] were
[00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.670] told
[00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.770] that
[00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.890] these
[00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:16.150] rats
[00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.270] were
[00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.670] bred
[00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:17.030] to
[00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.190] be
[00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.610] smart
[00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:17.990] learners
[00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.390] or
[00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.610] not
[00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:18.770] so
[00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:19.010] smart.
[00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:19.710] The
[00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.890] rats
[00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:20.030] were
[00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.150] all
[00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.310] just
[00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.550] random
[00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.850] rats.
[00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:21.890] It's
[00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:22.030] a
[00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.210] fake
[00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:22.550] story
[00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.990] to
[00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.610] undergraduates.
[00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.830] Then
[00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:25.010] they
[00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.210] had
[00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:25.410] them
[00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:26.210] test
[00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.370] on
[00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:26.490] a
[00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:26.690] maze.
[00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:26.830] And
[00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:26.890] they
[00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:27.070] said,
[00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.390] for
[00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.570] your
[00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:27.870] laboratory
[00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:28.390] exercise,
[00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:28.610] write
[00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:28.810] down
[00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:28.990] how
[00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.230] quickly
[00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.730] the
[00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:30.010] rat
[00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:30.430] runs
[00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.590] the
[00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:30.770] maze.
[00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:32.230] And
[00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.750] amazingly,
[00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.110] the
[00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:34.830] smart
[00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:35.190] rats
[00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.650] did
[00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:35.930] way
[00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:36.270] better
[00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.810] than
[00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:37.110] the
[00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:37.570] dull
[00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:37.910] rats.
[00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:39.210] Now,
[00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:39.350] these
[00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:39.450] are
[00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:39.610] not
[00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:40.010] students
[00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.510] trying
[00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.610] to
[00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:40.830] become
[00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:41.190] famous
[00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.330] or
[00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:41.430] have
[00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.490] a
[00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:41.650] career.
[00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:41.830] They're
[00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:42.030] handing
[00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.150] in
[00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.290] an
[00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.590] assignment.
[00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.190] And
[00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.350] how
[00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:44.490] did
[00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:44.670] that
[00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.990] happen?
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:46.960] Well,
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:47.060] they
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:47.200] went
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:47.520] back.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:47.640] And
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:47.740] it
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:47.920] wasn't
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.040] that
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:48.260] anybody
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:48.600] faked
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:48.740] it
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:48.820] or
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:48.960] anything
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.100] like
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:49.320] that,
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:49.500] but
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:49.700] when
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:49.800] they
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:49.940] looked
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.080] at
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:50.340] films
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:50.460] or
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:50.720] discussed
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:50.980] stuff
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:51.140] with
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:51.420] kids,
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.440] students
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:52.580] in
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:52.660] the
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:52.900] course,
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.080] every
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:54.340] little
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:54.760] thing
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.200] that
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:55.340] the
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:55.600] students
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:55.920] did
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.460] that
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:56.840] moved
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.000] the
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.300] data
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:57.900] in
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.460] tiny,
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:58.780] tiny
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:59.200] ways
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:39:59.900] always
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.380] favored
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.180] finding
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:01.400] the
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:01.700] maze
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.060] bright
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:02.400] rats
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:02.700] being
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.200] brilliant
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:03.740] maze
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:03.980] runners.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:04.620] So
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:04.800] for
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.220] example,
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.040] if
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:06.780] you've
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:06.960] ever
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.400] run
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:07.500] a
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:07.640] rat
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:07.720] in
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:07.840] a
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:07.940] maze,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:08.080] has
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.280] anybody
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:08.460] run
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:08.560] a
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:08.680] rat
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:08.780] in
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:08.880] a
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:08.960] maze?
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:09.880] Is
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:09.980] it
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.260] easy
[00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:12.290] if
[00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:12.710] you
[00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.890] pick
[00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:13.030] them
[00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.130] up
[00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.230] and
[00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:13.390] put
[00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.550] them
[00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.670] in
[00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.790] the
[00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.970] maze?
[00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:14.230] That's
[00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.310] when
[00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:14.450] they're
[00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:14.750] more
[00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:15.070] automated
[00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:15.410] now.
[00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:15.950] Is
[00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:16.110] it
[00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:16.630] physically
[00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.890] easy?
[00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.070] Are
[00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:17.230] rats
[00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.410] like,
[00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.070] please,
[00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.750] show
[00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.850] me
[00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:18.970] the
[00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:19.170] starting
[00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:19.410] line.
[00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.970] I'm
[00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:20.090] ready

[00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:20.450] go.
[00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:20.850] No.
[00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.990] What
[00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.070] are
[00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:21.170] they

[00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:22.070] for
[00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.150] you
[00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.270] guys
[00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.390] who've
[00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.510] done
[00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.690] this.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:23.800] Are
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:23.920] they
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.080] kind
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:24.180] of
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.500] really
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:25.740] at?
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:28.520] And
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:28.600] they
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:28.720] don't
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:28.840] like
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:28.900] to
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:29.000] be
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.240] handled
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:29.440] that
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:29.620] much,
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:29.800] really.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:30.780] Even
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.060] ones
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:31.160] in
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:31.300] Leon,
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:31.460] they're
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:31.520] like,
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:31.940] there's
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.180] fighting.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:32.300] And
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:32.400] these
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:32.480] are
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.020] undergraduates
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:33.180] who've
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:33.340] hardly
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:33.620] ever
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:33.960] touched
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.340] a
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:34.520] rat.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:34.760] OK,
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:34.900] they're
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.020] like,
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:35.540] please,
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.160] don't
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:36.460] attack
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:36.620] me
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:36.700] or
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:36.880] something.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:37.380] So
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:37.740] they're
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:37.960] holding
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.060] it
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:38.160] up,
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:38.400] and
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:38.540] the
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:38.740] rat's
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:38.960] fighting
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.340] back.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:39.640] And
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:39.840] because
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:39.960] it's
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:40.120] really
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:40.480] uncomfortable,
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:40.680] the
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:40.760] rat's
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:40.940] really
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:41.260] unhappy.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:41.360] And
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:41.460] the
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:41.820] student's
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:41.960] like,
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:42.140] really?
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.280] So
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:44.440] what
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:44.720] happens
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:44.980] is,
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:45.660] and
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:45.760] then
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:45.900] they
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.100] plunk
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:46.240] the
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:46.380] rat
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:46.760] down.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.160] And
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:47.200] they
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:47.280] go,
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:47.400] oh
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:47.500] my
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:47.680] gosh,
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:47.800] it's
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.060] facing
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:48.220] the
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:48.380] wrong
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:48.740] direction.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:48.920] And
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:49.040] it's
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:49.140] a
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:49.380] smart
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:49.560] one.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:49.760] Wait,
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:49.960] let's
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.400] stop
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:50.940] the
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:51.260] clock.
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:52.820] But
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:52.960] if
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.060] it's
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:53.220] a
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:53.580] dull
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:53.940] one
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:54.440] facing
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:54.640] the
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:54.800] wrong
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.140] direction,
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:55.820] it's
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:55.980] OK.
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:56.120] It's
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.220] a
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:56.360] dull
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:56.620] one.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:56.920] Let
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.060] the
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:57.260] maze
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:57.420] run.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:57.660] So
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.260] lots
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:58.400] of
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:58.580] little
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:58.960] things.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:40:59.280] Are
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:40:59.360] you
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:40:59.480] sure
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:40:59.600] you
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:40:59.760] wrote
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:40:59.900] this
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:00.080] down?
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:00.200] Was
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:00.300] it
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:00.520] 12
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:00.800] seconds
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:00.920] or
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.160] 11?
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:01.660] I
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.060] guess
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:02.120] it
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:02.240] was
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:02.580] 11.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.040] Oh,
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:03.220] because
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:03.340] it's
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:03.440] a
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:03.620] smart
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:03.840] one.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.220] So
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:05.660] completely
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.400] innocently,
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.100] completely
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:07.580] innocently,
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:07.720] as
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:07.840] far
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:07.940] as
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:08.040] we
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:08.480] understand,
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.020] they
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:09.540] made
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:09.720] the
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.120] result
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:10.580] to
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.400] match
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:11.540] up
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:11.660] with
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:11.800] what
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:11.940] the
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.360] expectation
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:12.740] was.
[00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:13.730] And
[00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:14.210] it's
[00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.430] not
[00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.710] just
[00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.930] that.
[00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:15.030] And
[00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.190] if
[00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.290] you
[00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.450] know
[00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:15.630] this
[00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:16.030] example,
[00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:17.010] cognitive
[00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:17.610] psychologies
[00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:17.830] have
[00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:18.130] studied
[00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:18.550] a
[00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.850] phenomenon
[00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:19.110] like
[00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:19.270] this.
[00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:19.390] So
[00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.570] try
[00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:19.750] this
[00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.870] at
[00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.990] your
[00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.250] desk.
[00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.930] Each
[00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:21.230] card
[00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.350] is
[00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:21.470] a
[00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.570] letter
[00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:21.750] on
[00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.930] one
[00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:22.170] side
[00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:22.290] and
[00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:22.390] a
[00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.570] number
[00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:22.750] on
[00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.870] the
[00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:23.030] other
[00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.310] side.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:24.300] Your
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:24.680] job
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:24.820] is
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:24.960] to
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.100] figure
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:25.400] out
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:25.740] what's
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:25.920] the
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.420] smallest
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:26.860] number
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.100] of
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:27.400] cards
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:27.540] you
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:27.640] have
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:27.740] to
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:27.920] pick
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.240] up
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:28.900] to
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.280] discover
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:29.500] if
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:29.740] this
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:29.980] rule
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:30.120] is
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:30.360] right.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.280] If
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:31.420] a
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:31.640] card
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:31.780] has
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:31.960] a
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.300] vowel
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:32.700] on
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:32.980] one
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:33.320] side,
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:33.920] then
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:33.980] it
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.100] has
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.220] an
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:34.460] even
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:34.800] number
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:34.940] on
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.020] the
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:35.160] other
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:35.440] side.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:35.980] So
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.180] think
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:36.360] about
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:36.500] this
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:36.640] for
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:36.720] a
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:36.900] moment.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:37.700] If
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:37.840] a
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.040] card
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:38.240] has
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:38.400] a
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:38.700] vowel
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.080] on
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:39.340] one
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:39.640] side,
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:40.320] then
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:40.420] it
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:40.640] has
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:40.780] to
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:40.900] have
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.040] an
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:41.260] even
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:41.580] number
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:41.720] on
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:41.800] the
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:41.920] other
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.080] side.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:42.240] What's
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:42.360] the
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:42.720] smallest
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.040] number
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.200] of
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:43.380] cards
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:43.520] you
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:43.640] can
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:43.860] pick
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.080] up
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:44.780] to
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.140] test
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:45.460] that
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:45.880] hypothesis?
[00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.690] So
[00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:48.950] here's
[00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:49.090] what
[00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:49.630] people
[00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.770] have
[00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:50.070] found.
[00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:50.890] The
[00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:51.150] correct
[00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:51.470] answer
[00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.730] is
[00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:52.150] E
[00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.470] and
[00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.790] 7.
[00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:54.250] And
[00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:54.450] about
[00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:54.730] 10
[00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:54.930]%
[00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:55.130] of
[00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:55.430] people,
[00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.730] on
[00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:56.050] average,
[00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.370] come
[00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:56.510] up
[00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.590] with
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:57.580] it.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.140] Many,
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:58.320] many
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:58.540] more
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:58.880] people
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.780] pick
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.200] E
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.680] alone
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.180] or
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:01.540] E
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:01.780] and
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:02.160] 6.
[00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:03.850] Why?
[00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:06.810] Well,
[00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:07.130] everybody
[00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:07.430] gets
[00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.530] that
[00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:07.610] you
[00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:07.790] have
[00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.910] to
[00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:08.130] look
[00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:08.250] at
[00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:08.470] E
[00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:09.510] because
[00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.750] it's
[00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.870] an
[00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:10.010] even
[00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.410] number.
[00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:11.430] So
[00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.530] you
[00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:11.750] flip
[00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:12.270] E
[00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.650] over.
[00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:12.890] And
[00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:13.030] if
[00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.310] that
[00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.670] one
[00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.970] turns
[00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:14.190] out
[00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.330] to
[00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:14.790] have
[00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:15.250] a
[00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:15.570] vowel,
[00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:15.890] if
[00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:16.010] it
[00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.210] has
[00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:16.370] an
[00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.610] odd
[00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:16.850] number,
[00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:17.230] the
[00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.470] hypothesis
[00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.670] is
[00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.890] wrong.
[00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.870] Everybody
[00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:20.110] gets
[00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.230] that
[00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.310] you
[00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:20.430] should
[00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.630] check
[00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.830] E.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:22.400] Pretty
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:22.620] much
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:22.860] everybody
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.200] gets
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:23.460] that
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.180] J
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:24.360] is
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:24.640] irrelevant
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:24.920] because
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.040] it's
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:25.160] a
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:25.480] consonant.
[00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:26.930] Now
[00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:27.150] comes
[00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.250] the
[00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:27.490] interesting
[00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:27.810] 6
[00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:27.930] and
[00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:28.210] 7.
[00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:30.310] Because
[00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:30.790] the
[00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:31.170] sentence
[00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:31.330] is
[00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:31.570] talking
[00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:31.910] about
[00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:32.230] a
[00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.530] vowel
[00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:32.910] and
[00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:33.090] an
[00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:33.350] even
[00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:33.770] number,
[00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:34.150] sometimes
[00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.390] people
[00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.570] feel
[00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:34.670] like,
[00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.810] I've
[00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:34.810] got
[00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:34.910] to
[00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:35.130] check
[00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:35.290] the
[00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:35.490] even
[00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:35.830] number.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.320] But
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:37.420] it
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:37.600] doesn't
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:37.740] say
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.000] anything
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.300] about
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:38.480] even
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:38.760] numbers
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.040] couldn't
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:39.160] go
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:39.340] with
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.220] consonants.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:40.360] It
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:40.520] doesn't
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.500] tell
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:41.600] you
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:41.780] anything.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.120] That's
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:42.240] not
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:42.920] part
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.000] of
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:43.120] the
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:43.600] hypothesis.
[00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:45.790] But
[00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:46.270] if
[00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.410] you
[00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:46.670] flipped
[00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:47.130] over
[00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:47.870] number
[00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:48.310] 7
[00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:48.770] and
[00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.890] you
[00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:49.370] discovered
[00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.710] a
[00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:50.650] vowel,
[00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.750] you'd
[00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.970] violate
[00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:52.170] the
[00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:52.310] rule.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:53.960] So
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:54.180] what
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:54.500] happens
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:54.680] is
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:54.900] they're
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.200] tempted
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:55.440] to
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:55.720] go
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:55.960] for
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.180] things
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:56.340] that
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:56.860] feel
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.160] like
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:57.340] they
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:57.800] confirm
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.760] the
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:42:59.240] question.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:42:59.640] And
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:42:59.740] it
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:42:59.880] feels
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.080] like
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:00.260] E
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:00.760] confirms
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:00.960] it.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:01.120] And
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.240] it
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:01.380] feels
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:01.620] like
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:01.940] 6
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:02.360] confirms
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:02.740] it.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.300] And
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:04.700] it's
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:04.940] what's
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.080] called
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.800] confirmatory
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.280] bias.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:06.720] That
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:06.840] when
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:06.940] you
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:07.140] look
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:07.280] at
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.600] stuff,
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:08.260] if
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:08.360] you
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:08.560] see
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:08.700] what
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:08.800] you
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:08.960] think
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:09.380] confirms
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:09.640] it,
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:10.820] then
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:10.940] you
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:11.080] tend
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:11.220] to
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:11.320] go
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:11.460] for
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:11.620] that,
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:11.820] even
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:11.960] when
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.140] there's
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:12.440] evidence
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:12.660] in
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:12.840] front
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:12.980] of
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.180] you
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:13.860] that
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.000] could
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.340] contradict
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:14.640] your
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.560] expectation.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.040] So
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:18.220] now
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:18.340] I'm
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:18.420] going
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:18.460] to
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:18.580] give
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:18.660] you
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:18.760] a
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.060] practical
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.780] suggestion
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:22.020] for
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:22.160] how
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:22.300] to
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:22.500] win
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:22.860] somebody
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:23.220] over
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:23.660] if
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:23.780] you
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:23.960] have
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.100] a
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:24.380] brewing
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:24.800] romantic
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.240] interest
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:25.380] in
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:25.520] that
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:25.800] person.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.180] So
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:27.480] finally,
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:27.640] we
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:27.740] get
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.060] practical.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:28.460] Everything
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:28.640] is
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:28.820] like,
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:29.520] I'm
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:29.640] not
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:29.840] running
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.240] rats.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:33.940] And
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:34.300] I
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:34.460] think
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:34.580] it's
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:34.780] very
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.040] interesting,
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:35.220] because
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:35.220] I
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:35.880] think
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.440] when
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:36.580] we
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:36.720] think
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:36.900] about
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.060] how
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:37.280] people
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:37.460] make
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:37.840] decisions
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:38.040] in
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:38.180] their
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:38.500] lives,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:38.800] we
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:38.940] tend
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:39.080] to
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:39.300] think
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:39.700] intuitively
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:39.920] about
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.140] big
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:40.480] decisions,
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:41.140] like
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:41.360] what's
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:41.500] my
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:41.740] career
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:41.920] going
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:42.000] to
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.260] be,
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:42.860] where
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:42.960] do
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.020] I
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.100] go
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:43.200] to
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:43.600] college.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.060] We
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:44.180] think
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:44.320] those
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:44.400] are
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:44.520] the
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:44.660] big
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:44.960] decisions.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:45.280] But
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:45.420] a
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:45.640] huge
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:45.840] amount
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:45.980] of
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:46.240] life
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:46.400] is
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:46.600] little
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:46.960] decisions.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:47.580] Moment
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:47.780] to
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:48.060] moment,
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:48.400] if
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:48.620] somebody
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:48.920] asks
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.020] you
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:49.140] for
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:49.260] something,
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:49.600] do
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:49.680] you
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:49.820] say
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:50.140] yes
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:50.400] or
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:50.620] no?
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.020] Somebody
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:51.300] walks
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:51.440] up
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:51.560] to
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:51.640] you
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:51.760] at
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:51.820] a
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:52.100] party,
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:52.860] they
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:53.360] want
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:53.460] to
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:53.620] talk
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:53.780] with
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:53.920] you.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:54.040] Do
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:54.120] you
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:54.260] feel
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:54.400] like
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:54.660] talking
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:54.800] or
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:54.980] not
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.100] feel
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:55.260] like
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:55.500] talking?
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.240] Maybe
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:56.380] you
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:56.580] talk
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:56.700] with
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:56.820] them
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:56.960] as
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.080] a
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.340] lifetime
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:57.740] friend,
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:57.960] a
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.260] romantic
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:58.640] partner,
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:43:59.280] or
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:43:59.500] whatever.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:43:59.840] So
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.780] I
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:00.880] think
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:00.980] we
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:01.160] make
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:01.620] constantly
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:01.880] little
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.240] decisions
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:02.440] that
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:02.600] turn
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:02.860] out
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.040] to
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:03.120] have
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:03.260] big
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:03.500] effects
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:03.600] in
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:03.720] our
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:03.960] lives.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:04.480] So
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:04.680] here's
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:04.880] some
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.160] evidence
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:05.380] about
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:05.600] things
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:05.740] like
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:05.940] that
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:06.720] that
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.020] influence
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:07.220] that.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:07.860] And
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:07.960] this
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.120] is
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:08.880] work
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:08.980] done
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:09.100] at
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:09.260] Yale.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:10.460] So
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:10.860] we
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:11.180] describe
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:11.600] people
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:11.820] as
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:12.340] warm,
[00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:13.450] or
[00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:13.610] we
[00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:13.730] can
[00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:14.050] define
[00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:14.210] them
[00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.350] as
[00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:14.770] cold
[00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:14.950] or
[00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:15.310] aloof,
[00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:15.650] right?
[00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.470] And
[00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.570] we
[00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:16.670] could
[00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.830] think
[00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:17.010] those
[00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:17.190] words
[00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.330] are
[00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:17.570] kind
[00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:17.690] of
[00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:18.150] arbitrary.
[00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:18.870] And
[00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:19.070] most
[00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:19.230] of
[00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.410] us,
[00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:19.530] if
[00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:19.610] you
[00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:19.790] met
[00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:20.110] somebody
[00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:20.250] at
[00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:20.350] a
[00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:20.550] party,
[00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:20.710] would
[00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.790] you
[00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.970] rather
[00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:21.190] hang
[00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.310] out
[00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:21.450] with
[00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:21.710] somebody
[00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.890] who's
[00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:22.330] warm
[00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:23.010] or
[00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:23.370] cold?
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.260] Warm,
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:25.520] OK.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:26.580] All
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:26.740] right,
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.120] just
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:27.780] checking
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:27.900] that
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:27.980] we're
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.640] OK.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:29.620] Now,
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.300] sometimes
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.140] there's
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:33.220] an
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:33.480] idea
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:33.660] of
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.140] embodied
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:34.600] cognition.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:34.940] And
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:35.120] here's
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:35.260] what
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:35.380] it
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:35.600] is.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:36.240] We
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:36.520] can't
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:36.720] really
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.160] know
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.860] how
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:38.240] warm
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:38.380] or
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:38.640] cold
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:38.840] that
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.220] person
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:39.420] is.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:39.500] Or
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:39.980] that's
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:40.100] even
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:40.380] an
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:40.660] abstract
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.120] idea.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.000] But
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:42.160] we
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:42.320] know
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:42.500] we're
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:42.880] comfortable
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.140] when
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:43.440] we're
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:43.720] kind
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:43.840] of
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.040] warm.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:44.160] And
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:44.280] we
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:44.460] know
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:44.620] we're
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:44.880] not
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.360] comfortable
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:45.880] physically
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:46.280] inside
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:46.540] us
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:46.740] when
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:46.820] we're
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:47.040] kind
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:47.160] of
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:47.440] cold.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:48.380] So
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:48.580] there's
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:48.680] an
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:48.980] idea
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:49.300] that
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:49.620] when
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:49.760] we
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.140] think
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:50.400] about
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:50.920] other
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.380] people's
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:51.740] feelings,
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.020] other
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:52.380] people's
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:52.660] thoughts,
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:52.800] or
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.120] abstract
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:53.480] things
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:53.620] in
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:53.740] the
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:54.020] world,
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:54.480] we
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:54.840] base
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:54.980] them
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:55.160] on
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:55.680] physical
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:56.220] experiences
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:56.420] that
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:56.540] we
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:56.800] have
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.260] inside.
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:57.660] That
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.260] there's
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:58.400] a
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:58.660] more
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.020] direct
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:44:59.340] link
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:44:59.980] between
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:00.760] what
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:00.960] we
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.180] know
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:01.540] inside
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.000] us.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:02.420] And
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:02.540] we
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:02.760] use
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:02.960] that
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.120] to
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:03.420] interpret
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:03.640] the
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:03.820] world
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:03.980] out
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.140] there.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:04.760] Embodied
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.040] cognition,
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:05.280] your
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:05.720] body
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.360] is
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:06.500] the
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:06.880] vehicle
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.100] for
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:07.440] understanding
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:07.760] things
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:07.920] out
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.140] there.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:08.880] So
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.380] here's
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:09.720] the
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.120] experiment.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:10.300] It's
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:10.500] really
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:10.780] clever.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:11.980] There's
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:12.180] two
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:12.700] temperature
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.220] conditions.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:14.440] So
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:14.580] what
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:14.860] happens
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:15.000] is
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:15.140] you
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:15.320] go
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:15.520] into
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:15.680] a
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:15.920] building.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:16.600] And
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.020] the
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:17.920] examiner,
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:18.440] an
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:18.880] undergraduate,
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:19.460] usually
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:19.600] a
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:19.820] graduate
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:20.060] student,
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:20.340] meets
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:20.480] the
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:20.760] subject
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:20.940] in
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:21.080] the
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:21.280] lobby.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:21.920] And
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.180] he's
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:22.960] carrying
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.140] a
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:23.400] cup
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:23.840] of
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:24.280] coffee.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:25.180] Sometimes
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:25.460] it's
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:25.720] hot
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.060] coffee.
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:26.440] Sometimes
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:26.680] it's
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:26.880] cold
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.220] coffee.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:28.660] A
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:29.060] clipboard,
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:29.520] two
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.000] textbooks.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.020] So
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:31.220] you
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:31.360] can
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:31.700] imagine,
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:32.160] it's
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:32.240] a
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:32.480] setup.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.220] Person's
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:33.420] walking,
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:33.600] they're
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:33.840] juggling
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.060] with
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:34.180] the
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:34.480] coffee,
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:34.640] the
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.000] textbook,
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:35.280] all
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:35.400] the
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:35.780] clipboard.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:36.940] And
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.340] on
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:37.460] the
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:37.680] elevator
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:37.800] it
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:37.960] says,
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:38.220] could
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:38.300] you
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:38.480] just
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:38.680] hold
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:38.900] my
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:39.180] cup
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:39.840] while
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:39.960] I
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.100] write
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:40.240] down
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:40.380] your
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:40.580] name
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:40.700] on
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:40.820] my
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:41.040] list
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:41.200] of
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:41.540] subjects
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:41.720] in
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:41.840] the
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.160] experiment?
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:42.840] It's
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.040] very
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:43.440] innocent
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.620] on
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:44.800] the
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.160] elevator.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:45.620] And
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:45.700] so
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:45.780] you
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:46.000] hold
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:46.140] the
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:46.300] cup
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:46.440] of
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:46.720] coffee,
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.020] which
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.000] half
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:48.120] the
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:48.300] people
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:48.440] get
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:48.600] a
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:48.900] hot
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.160] cup,
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:49.460] half
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:49.580] the
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:49.760] people
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:49.920] get
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:50.020] a
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:50.200] cold
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:50.440] cup.
[00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.950] Then
[00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:52.050] you
[00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:52.170] read
[00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:52.270] a
[00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.590] description
[00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:52.790] of
[00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.890] a
[00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:53.110] person.
[00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:53.230] It's
[00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.350] just
[00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:53.470] a
[00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.710] paragraph.
[00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:54.130] And
[00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:54.270] you
[00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.490] have
[00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:54.850] to
[00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:55.330] rate
[00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:55.690] whether
[00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:55.810] you
[00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:56.010] find
[00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:56.110] the
[00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:56.390] person
[00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:57.390] described
[00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:57.830] as
[00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:58.170] warm
[00:45:58.170 --> 00:45:58.350] or
[00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:58.670] cold.
[00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.430] And
[00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.530] if
[00:45:59.530 --> 00:45:59.590] you
[00:45:59.590 --> 00:45:59.690] had
[00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.830] the
[00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:00.230] warm
[00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.530] cup
[00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:00.710] of
[00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:01.030] coffee,
[00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:01.650] you're
[00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:01.790] more
[00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:02.050] likely
[00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:02.190] to
[00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.490] describe
[00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:02.670] that
[00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.970] person
[00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:03.210] as
[00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:03.370] a
[00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:03.650] warm
[00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:03.950] kind
[00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:04.050] of
[00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:04.170] a
[00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:04.450] person.
[00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:05.710] Now,
[00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:05.990] these
[00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.230] subjects
[00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.410] have
[00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.590] no
[00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:06.850] idea.
[00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:07.050] They
[00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:07.170] held
[00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:07.270] a
[00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.410] cup
[00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:07.530] of
[00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:07.770] coffee.
[00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:07.950] They
[00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:08.150] probably
[00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.310] didn't
[00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:08.510] even
[00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.670] think
[00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.790] whether
[00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.890] it
[00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:08.950] was
[00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:09.150] warm
[00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.270] or
[00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.490] cold.
[00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:10.410] But
[00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:10.770] something
[00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:11.010] in
[00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:11.130] their
[00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:11.430] body,
[00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:11.630] they
[00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.830] got
[00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:12.110] warmed
[00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:12.290] up
[00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.430] to
[00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.590] the
[00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:13.010] least
[00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.450] degree
[00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:13.930] possible.
[00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:15.710] That
[00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:16.070] thought
[00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:16.290] is
[00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:16.470] still
[00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.590] in
[00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:16.690] their
[00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:16.910] head.
[00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:17.070] So
[00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:17.190] when
[00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.290] they
[00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:17.450] read
[00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.550] a
[00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:17.830] description,
[00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:18.010] some
[00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:18.070] of
[00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:18.070] them
[00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:18.170] go,
[00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.330] oh,
[00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:18.470] this
[00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.610] seems
[00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:18.750] like
[00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.870] a
[00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:19.030] warm
[00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.330] person.
[00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:20.070] Or
[00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:20.150] if
[00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.210] it
[00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.290] was
[00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:20.430] a
[00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.630] cold
[00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.810] cup
[00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:20.990] of
[00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.270] coffee,
[00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:22.290] they
[00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:22.510] say,
[00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:23.050] oh,
[00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:23.590] this
[00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:23.750] seems
[00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.890] like
[00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:24.010] a
[00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:24.250] cold,
[00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:24.510] aloof
[00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.730] kind
[00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:24.810] of
[00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:25.070] person,
[00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:25.330] as
[00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:25.470] far
[00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.570] as
[00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:25.670] I
[00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.790] can
[00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:26.050] tell,
[00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:27.010] that
[00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:27.370] little
[00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:27.530] bit
[00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.650] of
[00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.970] difference.
[00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.630] So
[00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:29.410] here's
[00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:29.510] the
[00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.750] lesson,
[00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:29.950] just
[00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:30.050] so
[00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:30.150] you
[00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.370] got
[00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:30.490] it.
[00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.850] If
[00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:30.990] you
[00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.150] want
[00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.250] to
[00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:31.450] take
[00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:31.810] somebody
[00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:32.550] because
[00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.710] you
[00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.930] have
[00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:33.090] a
[00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:33.510] possible
[00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:34.050] friendship
[00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:34.230] or
[00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.530] romantic
[00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:34.870] interest
[00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:35.030] in
[00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.170] that
[00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:35.490] person,
[00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:35.950] are
[00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:36.050] you
[00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.270] better
[00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:36.510] off
[00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.710] going
[00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.890] out
[00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:37.050] for
[00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:37.230] a
[00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.470] warm
[00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.690] cup
[00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:37.850] of
[00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:38.150] coffee
[00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.410] or
[00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:38.650] giving
[00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:38.890] them
[00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:39.130] a
[00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:39.690] cold
[00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:40.030] glass
[00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.210] of
[00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:40.450] beer?
[00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:44.170] For
[00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:44.330] that
[00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:44.630] first
[00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:45.130] impression,
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:46.480] scientific
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:46.860] research
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.600] shows
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:49.180] something
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:49.620] warm
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.520] will
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:50.840] work.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:52.520] It's
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:52.660] not
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:52.840] that
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.180] powerful.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:53.460] You're
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:53.580] not
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:53.680] going
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:53.740] to
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:53.860] be
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:53.960] able
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.100] to
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:54.360] control
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:54.540] the
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:54.740] world.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:57.260] But
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:57.660] what
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:57.820] it
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.000] says
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:58.160] is
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:58.560] when
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:46:58.760] we're
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:58.860] in
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:59.140] ambiguous
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:46:59.940] situations,
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:01.360] we
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:01.600] first
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:01.780] meet
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:02.080] somebody,
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.240] we
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:02.380] don't
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:02.580] really
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:02.780] know
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:02.980] them.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:03.340] Little
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:03.640] things
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:03.820] can
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.120] start
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:04.300] us
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:04.500] off
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:04.620] on
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:04.780] one
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.060] path
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:05.160] or
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:05.340] can
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:05.540] start
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:05.720] us
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:05.880] off
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:05.980] on
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:06.140] another
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:06.340] path,
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:06.920] surprisingly
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:07.260] little
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:07.660] things.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:09.600] Now,
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:10.140] then
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:10.220] they
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:10.320] have
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:10.400] to
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:10.520] worry
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:10.660] about
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:10.800] a
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.220] confound.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:11.400] Can
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:11.480] you
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:11.720] imagine
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:11.900] a
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.260] confound
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:12.500] here?
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:13.220] Think
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:13.320] of
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:13.440] the
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:13.720] rats.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:14.280] Who
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:14.840] knows
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.160] if
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:15.300] the
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:15.540] cup
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.000] is
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.460] cold
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:16.600] or
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:16.840] hot
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.260] besides
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:17.440] the
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:17.620] person
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:17.900] holding
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.140] it?
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:20.840] The
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.300] examiner,
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:21.940] right?
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:22.440] OK.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:23.280] Now,
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:23.600] maybe
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:23.780] the
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:24.200] examiner
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:24.720] doesn't
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:24.960] try
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.100] to
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:25.200] do
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:25.380] this,
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:25.520] but
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:25.720] maybe
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:25.880] the
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.200] examiner,
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:26.400] no
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:26.620] matter
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:26.840] what,
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:27.040] says,
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:27.660] oh,
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:27.760] we're
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:27.840] in
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:27.960] the
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:28.300] warm
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:28.760] condition,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.080] and
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.260] I'm
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:29.720] smiling,
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:29.920] and
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.060] this
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:30.180] is
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:30.300] going
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:30.340] to
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:30.460] be
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:30.840] nice,
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.060] I'm
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:31.260] helping
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:31.440] this
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:31.620] person
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:31.920] feel
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.160] good,
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:32.800] and
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.260] here's
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:33.400] the
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:33.640] aloof
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.060] condition,
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:34.660] and
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:34.820] we're
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:34.960] all
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.060] going
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:35.060] to
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:35.180] be
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:35.560] miserable.
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:36.200] And
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:36.320] the
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:36.600] examiner
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:36.860] knows
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:37.000] it
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:37.200] because
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:37.440] they
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:37.640] know
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:37.780] if
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:37.880] they
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:38.040] have
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:38.120] a
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:38.280] hot
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:38.420] or
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:38.600] cold
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:38.800] cup
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:38.940] of
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:39.160] coffee.
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:39.340] So
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:39.540] maybe
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:39.720] the
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.040] person's
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:40.300] not
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:40.960] vibing
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.320] to
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:41.440] the
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:41.700] coffee.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:41.920] They're
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:42.280] vibing
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:42.440] to
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:42.700] the
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.540] expression,
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:43.820] or
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.140] feeling,
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:44.320] or
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:44.660] sentiment
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.100] of
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:45.220] the
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:45.660] examiner
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.040] who
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:46.620] understands
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:46.840] what's
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:46.980] going
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:47.220] on.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:47.820] So
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:47.940] they
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:48.040] do
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:48.180] one
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:48.280] more
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:48.560] experiment
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:48.720] where
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:48.820] they
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:48.980] give,
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:49.420] have
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:49.500] you
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:49.620] seen
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:49.760] these
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:49.960] hot
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.080] and
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:50.280] icy
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:50.760] therapeutic
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.120] packs
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:51.240] that
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:51.300] you
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:51.400] could
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:51.580] make
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:51.720] hot
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:51.840] or
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.000] cold?
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:52.180] OK.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:52.880] Now,
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:53.520] somebody
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:53.880] else
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.120] makes
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:54.220] it
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:54.380] hot
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:54.500] or
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:54.740] cold.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.140] The
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:55.700] experimenter
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:55.820] has
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:56.000] no
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.280] idea
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:56.540] whether
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:56.680] it
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:56.780] was
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:56.920] hot
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.040] or
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:57.280] cold.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:57.680] So
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:57.840] it's
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.040] what
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:58.140] we
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:58.300] call
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:58.540] double
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:58.860] blind.
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:47:59.040] The
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:47:59.240] person
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:47:59.460] doesn't
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:47:59.600] know
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:47:59.680] it's
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:47:59.980] relevant,
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:00.220] the
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:00.620] experimenter.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:01.360] They
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:01.540] rate
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:01.700] the
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:01.940] pad.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:02.180] And
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:02.460] now,
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:02.980] this
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.180] moves
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:03.260] a
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:03.360] little
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:03.520] bit,
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:04.020] they
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:04.280] either
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:04.580] get,
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.160] after
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:05.380] this
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:05.660] thing
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:05.760] is
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:05.880] over,
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:06.020] they're
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:06.140] told
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:06.260] it's
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:06.380] a
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:06.680] product
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.180] evaluation
[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:07.420] of
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:07.540] the
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:07.820] pad,
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:08.160] but
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:08.300] they
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:08.440] either
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:08.600] got
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:08.720] a
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:08.920] hot
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.160] pad
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:09.260] or
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:09.360] a
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:09.520] cold
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:09.760] pad.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:10.780] And
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:10.880] they
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.000] could
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:11.220] either
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:11.680] choose
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.680] one
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:12.800] of
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:12.940] two
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:13.260] rewards,
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:13.400] a
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:13.740] Snapple
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:14.000] beverage
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.220] or
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:14.340] a
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:14.540] dollar
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:14.740] gift
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:15.180] certificate,
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:15.500] whichever
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:15.740] you
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:15.880] like
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.140] better.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:16.460] OK,
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:16.540] you
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:16.660] had
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:16.940] two
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:17.180] little
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:17.440] things
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:17.520] you
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:17.620] could
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:17.800] do.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:18.440] But
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:18.620] here's
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:18.720] the
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:18.840] big
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.120] decision.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:19.320] Do
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:19.400] you
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:19.560] get
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:19.680] it
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:19.800] for
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.240] yourself,
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:20.620] or
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:20.900] we
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:21.040] can
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:21.260] send
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:21.420] it
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:22.140] for
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:22.480] you
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:22.760] to
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:22.900] a
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:23.160] friend?
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:23.440] We
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:23.560] can
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:23.820] send
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:24.000] them
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.720] the
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.020] Snapple
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:25.140] or
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:25.280] the
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:25.620] certificate.
[00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.750] If
[00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.870] the
[00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:27.090] people
[00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:27.310] got
[00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:27.510] a
[00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.810] cold
[00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:28.170] pad,
[00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:29.210] 75
[00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.710]%
[00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.830] of
[00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:29.890] the
[00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:30.110] times
[00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:30.230] they
[00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.370] say,
[00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:30.670] please
[00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:30.830] give
[00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:30.890] it
[00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.970] to
[00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:31.070] me
[00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:31.230] right
[00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.390] now,
[00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.490] I'll
[00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:31.670] take
[00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.790] it.
[00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:32.770] If
[00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:32.870] they
[00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.990] had
[00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.150] a
[00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.390] warm
[00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.810] pad,
[00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:35.890] the
[00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:36.450] majority
[00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:36.610] of
[00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:36.610] the
[00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:36.770] time,
[00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:36.890] they
[00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:37.050] actually
[00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:37.290] send
[00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:37.350] it
[00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:37.450] to
[00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:37.590] their
[00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:37.830] friend.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:39.500] That
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:39.980] pad
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:40.500] difference
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.340] moved
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:42.560] quite
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.080] substantially
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:43.320] the
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:43.580] likelihood
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:43.800] that
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:43.880] you
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:44.120] take
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:44.200] it
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:44.340] for
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:44.740] yourself
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:45.400] or
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:45.480] you
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:45.640] give
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:45.760] it
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.020] away,
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:46.420] quite
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:46.920] substantially.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.540] If
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:48.120] you're
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:48.240] a

[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:50.300] get
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:50.520] help
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:50.700] from
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:51.040] somebody,

[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:54.500] is
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:54.620] a
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:54.740] lot
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:55.040] worse
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.760] than
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:56.180] a
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.380] 54%.
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:57.800] It's
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:57.980] a
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:58.280] doubling,

[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:00.720] yourself
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:00.900] or
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:01.060] you're
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:01.340] generous
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:01.480] to

[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:05.780] pad.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.080] I'm
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:07.100] going

[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:07.220] do
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:07.380] two

[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.120] and

[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:08.720] beer.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.300] How
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:09.420] about
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:09.800] money?
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:10.780] When
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:10.900] you
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.200] think
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:11.400] about
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:11.600] money,
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:11.760] I
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:11.860] don't
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:11.980] mean
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:12.420] traumatic
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:12.740] things
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:12.900] about
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:13.060] money,
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:13.260] just
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:13.440] a
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:13.580] little
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:13.760] bit
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:13.940] about
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.220] money.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:14.640] How
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:14.760] does
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:14.860] it
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:15.140] influence
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:15.320] how
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:15.440] you
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:15.760] relate
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:15.900] to
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:16.080] other
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:16.360] people?
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:17.960] OK,
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:18.200] here's
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:18.280] the
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:18.580] experiment.
[00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:19.990] The
[00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.210] idea
[00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.350] is
[00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:20.490] that
[00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:20.850] money,
[00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.330] on
[00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:21.550] average,
[00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:21.690] when
[00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:21.770] you
[00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.910] just
[00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:22.090] think
[00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:22.210] a
[00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:22.310] little
[00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:22.470] bit
[00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.690] about
[00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:22.810] it,
[00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:22.910] and
[00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.990] I'll
[00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.170] show
[00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:23.290] you
[00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:23.450] how
[00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.990] ridiculously
[00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.430] little
[00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:24.870] they
[00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:25.070] think
[00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:25.290] about
[00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:25.470] it,
[00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:27.690] their
[00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:28.130] hypothesis
[00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.250] is
[00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.350] that
[00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:28.550] money
[00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.750] makes
[00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:28.870] you
[00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:29.050] think
[00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:29.250] about
[00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:29.530] self
[00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:29.950]-reliance.
[00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.070] You
[00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:30.290] earn
[00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.410] your
[00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.630] money,
[00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.770] you
[00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:30.850] have
[00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:30.930] your
[00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:31.150] bank
[00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:31.430] account,
[00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:33.010] compared
[00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:33.230] to
[00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.630] situations
[00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:34.030] where
[00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.250] you're
[00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:34.410] not
[00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:34.650] thinking
[00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:34.870] about
[00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:35.110] money.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:36.480] So
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:36.940] here's
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.060] what
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:37.160] they
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:37.300] did.
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:37.440] They
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:37.540] had
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:37.760] people
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:37.980] come
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:38.200] in
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:38.480] in
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:38.700] three
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:39.160] conditions.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:39.840] And
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:39.940] they
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:40.020] had
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:40.140] to
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:40.700] unscramble
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.200] sentences.
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:41.380] You
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:41.480] have
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:41.660] no
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:41.780] idea
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:41.980] what's
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:42.140] going
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:42.320] on.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:43.520] You've
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:43.580] got
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:43.700] a
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:43.880] sentence
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:44.080] like,
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:44.640] cold
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:44.840] it
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:45.180] desk
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:45.640] outside
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.060] is,
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.180] which
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:47.280] you
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:47.420] would

[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:48.160] a
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:48.300] good
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:48.660] sentence,
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:49.780] or
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:50.480] high

[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:51.700] paying.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:52.560] So
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:52.640] you
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:52.740] just
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:52.920] make
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.080] those,

[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:54.160] around.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:54.320] But
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:54.640] the
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:54.780] money
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:55.080] condition

[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:00.220] that
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:00.360] have
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:00.500] no

[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.020] reference,
[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:01.560] and
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:02.040] you
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:02.240] see

[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:04.620] room.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:05.200] So
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:05.320] we're

[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:15.180] financially,
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:15.360] or

[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:15.700] the

[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:16.480] It's
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:16.920] monopoly
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:17.360] money.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:18.320] It's
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:18.500] just
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:18.740] like
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:18.880] the

[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:22.100] And
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:22.240] then
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:22.380] they
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:22.520] give

[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:50.280] That's
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:50.400] why
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:50.580] you're
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:50.700] not

[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:54.900] Maybe
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:55.120] that's
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:55.220] why
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:55.340] they
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:55.480] also
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:55.600] had
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:55.700] the

[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:56.500] the
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:56.780] scrambled
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.220] sentences.

[00:51:59.440 --> 00:51:59.540] with

[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.100] You
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:00.360] can
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:00.520] think
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:00.660] there's
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:00.940] many,
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:01.120] many
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:01.340] ways
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:01.460] to

[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:02.080] this.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:03.400] The

[00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:06.810] behavior.
[00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:08.750] And
[00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:09.090] the
[00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:09.190] way,
[00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:09.410] again,
[00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.550] an
[00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:09.830] experiment
[00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:10.270] can
[00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.790] challenge
[00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:11.270] various
[00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.610] ideas.
[00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.930] And
[00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:13.110] this
[00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:13.230] is

[00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:16.770] been
[00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:16.950] studied,
[00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:17.130] would
[00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:17.250] be
[00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:17.390] a
[00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.490] little
[00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:17.650] bit
[00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:17.850] different

[00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:33.010] have
[00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:33.130] to

[00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:38.950] you.
[00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.410] So
[00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:43.790] an
[00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:44.270] evolutionary
[00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.930] psychologist,
[00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.290] and
[00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.590] I

[00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:46.890] but
[00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:46.990] it
[00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.170] drives
[00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:47.290] me
[00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:47.510] crazy,

[00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.770] Evolutionary
[00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:49.150] psychologists
[00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:49.330] will
[00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:49.450] go,
[00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:49.770] well,
[00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:50.070] because

[00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.410] evolutionary
[00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.830] theory,
[00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.170] men
[00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:52.310] have
[00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:52.410] to
[00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:52.530] go
[00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:52.650] and
[00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:52.790] make
[00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.910] as
[00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:53.290] many
[00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:53.750] offspring
[00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:54.050] as
[00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:54.190] they
[00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:54.430] can
[00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:54.590] to
[00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:54.750] keep
[00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.890] their
[00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:55.070] genes
[00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:55.330] going.
[00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:55.750] Women

[00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:56.070] to
[00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:56.170] be
[00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:56.330] more
[00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:56.670] selective.
[00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.850] It
[00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:57.010] takes
[00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:57.210] nine
[00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:57.390] months
[00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.530] to
[00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:57.650] bear
[00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.770] a
[00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.990] baby.
[00:52:58.290 --> 00:52:58.450] It
[00:52:58.450 --> 00:52:58.650] takes
[00:52:58.650 --> 00:52:58.850] nine
[00:52:58.850 --> 00:52:59.190] seconds
[00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.770] to
[00:52:59.770 --> 00:52:59.890] do

[00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:00.370] part,
[00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:00.550] right?
[00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:04.010] Estimated.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:05.960] OK.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:08.640] So
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:08.960] this
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.180] might
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:09.280] or
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:09.440] might
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:09.580] not
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:09.720] be
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:09.860] true.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.000] It's
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:10.140] kind
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:10.220] of
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:10.380] fun.
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:10.500] We
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:10.620] all
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:10.800] laugh
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:10.920] about
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:11.020] it.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:11.360] All
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:11.460] of
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:11.540] us
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:11.660] find
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:11.740] it
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:11.880] kind
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:11.960] of

[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:12.600] of
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:12.760] think
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.000] about,
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:13.120] you
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:13.240] know.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:15.600] But
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:15.920] how
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.040] would
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:16.140] we
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:16.400] actually
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:16.820] know
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:17.500] if
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:17.680] this
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:17.840] is
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.220] vaguely
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:18.500] true,
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:18.740] on
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:19.180] average?
[00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:20.250] How
[00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:20.370] would
[00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:20.470] we
[00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.650] actually
[00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:21.190] know
[00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:22.090] if
[00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:22.470] men,
[00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:22.870] for
[00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:23.210] dating
[00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.690] behavior,
[00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:23.830] are
[00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:23.910] more,
[00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:24.050] how
[00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:24.150] would
[00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.250] we
[00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:24.450] even,
[00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.290] is
[00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:25.450] that
[00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:25.690] true?
[00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.270] Is
[00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.410] that
[00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:26.670] a
[00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:27.670] bad
[00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:28.070] myth,
[00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:28.350] a
[00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:28.690] bad
[00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:29.070] rap,
[00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:29.190] or
[00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.390] whatever?
[00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:29.670] Yeah?
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.040] AUDIENCE
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.040] MEMBER
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.040] 2
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.040] Yeah,
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:32.360] thank
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:32.440] you
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:32.600] very
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:32.800] much.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.180] So
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:33.400] there's
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:33.520] an
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.020] entire
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.840] research
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.460] enterprise
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:36.680] out
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:36.780] there
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.080] now
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:37.400] that
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:37.660] uses
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:38.120] online
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:38.420] dating
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:38.760] sites,
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:38.940] which,
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:39.220] of
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:39.360] course,
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:39.540] it's
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:39.680] only
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:39.780] in
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:39.840] the
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.020] last
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:40.320] 20
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:40.520] years
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:40.640] or
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:40.920] something
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:41.420] that
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:41.760] they've
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.120] existed,
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:42.360] I
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:42.520] think.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:42.760] So
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.440] it
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:43.640] wasn't
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:43.920] before.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:44.340] And
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:44.440] the
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:44.600] other
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:44.760] one
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:44.920] that's
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.040] been
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:45.600] a
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:45.880] treasure
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.200] trove
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:46.340] of
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:46.520] data
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:46.740] is
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.160] speed
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:47.560] dating
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.620] environments,
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:48.960] where
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.320] you
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:49.440] can
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:49.720] observe
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.000] things
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:50.120] and
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:50.320] measure
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:50.640] things.
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:51.280] And
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:51.920] those
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:52.120] studies
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:52.260] have
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:52.520] shown,
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:52.860] for
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:53.200] example,
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:53.720] that
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.200] online
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:54.540] dating,
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:54.740] on
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.000] average,
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:55.220] men
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:55.340] are
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:55.600] 1
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:55.700] and
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:55.900] 1⁄2
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:56.120] times
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:56.340] more
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:56.600] likely
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:56.760] to
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:56.900] send
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:57.220] email
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:57.660] offerings,
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:58.460] dates,
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:58.700] to
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:58.820] a
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:58.960] woman
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.120] than
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:53:59.240] the
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:53:59.360] other
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:53:59.520] way
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:53:59.900] around,
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.340] compared
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:00.520] to
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:00.720] women.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:01.400] And
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:01.560] in
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:01.800] speed
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:02.080] dating,
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:02.460] too,
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.700] men
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:03.960] are
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.200] more
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:04.540] likely
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:04.720] to
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.060] indicate
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:05.260] they
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:05.800] would
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:05.940] be
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:06.160] happy
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:06.380] to
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:06.600] date
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:06.900] a
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.100] person
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:07.260] they
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:07.460] met
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.140] than
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:08.360] women.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:08.560] So
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.360] there's
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:09.680] objective
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.020] evidence
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:10.200] that
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:10.320] this
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:10.440] is
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:10.640] true,
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:10.860] on
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:11.180] average,
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:11.340] in
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:11.460] this
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:11.820] society
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:12.060] at
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.180] this
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:12.400] time.
[00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.250] And
[00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:14.350] so
[00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:14.490] everybody
[00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:14.630] goes,
[00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:14.850] oh,
[00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:15.110] yeah,
[00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:15.350] this
[00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:15.570] shows
[00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:15.710] the
[00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:16.050] evolutionary
[00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:16.510] psychology.
[00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:17.330] Evolutionary
[00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:17.610] psychology
[00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:17.770] is
[00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:17.890] actually
[00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:18.170] crazy,
[00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.330] because
[00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:18.390] on
[00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.470] the
[00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.610] one
[00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:18.810] hand,
[00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.190] it's
[00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.430] certainly
[00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.650] the
[00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:19.930] case
[00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:20.350] that
[00:54:20.350 --> 00:54:20.490] our
[00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:20.830] minds
[00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:21.010] and
[00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:21.270] brains
[00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.950] evolved
[00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:22.990] through
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:23.460] evolution.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:24.640] So
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.040] there's
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:25.300] something
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:25.740] about
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:26.220] the
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:26.500] history
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:26.680] we
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:26.860] went
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:27.040] through
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:27.180] as
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:27.300] a
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:27.540] species
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:27.840] that
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:28.160] matters
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:28.320] for
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:28.460] who
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:28.620] we
[00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:28.760] are
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.020] now.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:29.300] That's
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:29.520] got
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:29.580] to
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:29.680] be
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:29.800] the
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.060] case.
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:30.620] On
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:30.760] the
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:30.920] other
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:31.200] hand,
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:31.780] it
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:31.900] was
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:32.000] a
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:32.200] different
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:32.460] world
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:32.780] before
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.120] internet
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:33.440] dating
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:33.600] and
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:33.800] speed
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:34.020] dating.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:34.560] I
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:34.700] mean,
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:34.980] it's
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:35.140] hard
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:35.300] to
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:35.520] know
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:35.680] how
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:35.880] those

[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:36.920] exactly.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:37.400] So
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:37.680] here's
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:37.800] the
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.000] fun
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:38.200] thing.
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:38.560] It
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:38.740] turns
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:38.960] out
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:39.120] that,
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:39.220] on
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:39.540] average,
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:39.700] in

[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:43.060] minutes.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:43.620] So
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:43.800] you
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.080] typically
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:44.240] have

[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:50.260] meet,
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:50.340] and
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:50.420] they

[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:50.780] for
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:51.020] four
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:51.180] minutes.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:51.320] The
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:51.460] bell
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:51.700] rings.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.080] The
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:52.200] men
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:52.440] jump
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:52.600] up,
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:52.680] and

[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:55.160] what
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:55.480] happens
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:55.720] is,

[00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.910] And
[00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:22.010] the

[00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:30.170] almost
[00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.430] never
[00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:30.750] happens,
[00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:30.910] but
[00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:31.010] they
[00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.130] did
[00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.290] this

[00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.590] They
[00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:32.750] said,
[00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:33.090] for

[00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:36.170] will
[00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.410] be
[00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:36.630] sitting
[00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.850] at

[00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:37.210] table.
[00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:37.430] And
[00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.550] the
[00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:37.710] women
[00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:37.870] will
[00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:38.130] stand

[00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.250] rings.
[00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:40.730] So
[00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.890] the
[00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:41.090] women
[00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:41.270] are

[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:46.480] Basically,
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:46.720] what's
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:46.920] showing
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.100] on
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:47.240] the
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:47.580] left
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:48.320] are,
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:48.580] when
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:48.720] the
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:48.900] men
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:49.260] rotate,
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:49.440] the
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:49.740] standard
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.240] condition.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:51.120] The
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:51.480] first
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:51.600] one
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:51.720] is
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.180] romantic
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:52.640] desire.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:52.940] Men
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:53.380] feel
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:53.620] more
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:54.060] romantic
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:54.520] desire,
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:54.800] on
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.100] average,
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:55.260] for
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:55.380] the
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:55.600] partner
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:55.800] they
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:55.980] sit
[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:56.220] with.
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:56.680] They
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.020] feel
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:57.180] that
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:57.360] more
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:57.800] chemistry
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.060] is
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:58.400] happening
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.360] with
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:55:59.460] the
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:55:59.660] person
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:55:59.840] they
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:55:59.980] sit
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:00.180] with.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:00.900] And
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:01.600] on
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.020] the
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:02.340] bottom
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:02.940] left
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:03.340] corner,
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.280] they
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.180] also
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.600] are
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:06.920] more
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:07.140] likely
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:07.400] to
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:07.880] give
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:07.960] a
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.120] yes
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:08.480] response.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:08.600] I
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:08.700] would
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:08.840] like
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:08.960] a
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:09.060] date
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:09.200] with
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:09.340] this
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:09.620] person.
[00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:11.670] But
[00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:12.210] reverse
[00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:12.610] the
[00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:13.110] roles,
[00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:13.470] have
[00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.570] the
[00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:13.750] women
[00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:14.150] rotating,
[00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:14.450] and
[00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:14.590] look
[00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:14.690] at
[00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.870] these
[00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:15.190] bars.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:16.520] There's
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:16.660] no
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:16.920] difference
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.060] at
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:17.240] all.
[00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:18.750] You
[00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:19.510] completely
[00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.950] wipe
[00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:20.230] out
[00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.790] the
[00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:21.030] male
[00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.330]-female
[00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:21.850] difference
[00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:22.290] in
[00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:22.590] self
[00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:23.050]-reported
[00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:23.450] romantic
[00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:24.030] desire
[00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:24.510] for
[00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.570] a
[00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:24.790] person,
[00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:25.110] self
[00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:25.950]-reported
[00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:26.570] chemistry
[00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:26.790] they
[00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:26.990] think
[00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.130] is
[00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:27.430] happening,
[00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:28.130] and
[00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:28.290] the
[00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:28.530] yes
[00:56:28.530 --> 00:56:28.750]-no
[00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:29.250] responses
[00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:29.490] that
[00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:29.570] it
[00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:29.650] would
[00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:29.790] have
[00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:29.890] a
[00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:29.930] date.
[00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:30.070] You
[00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:30.650] completely
[00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:31.090] eliminate
[00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:31.450] it
[00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:31.870] when
[00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:32.050] the
[00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:32.270] women
[00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.710] are
[00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:33.090] rotating.
[00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.950] It's
[00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:34.210] flat
[00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:34.430] even.
[00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.430] So
[00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.870] that's
[00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.990] the
[00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.290] result.
[00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:38.830] What
[00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:38.930] does
[00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:39.070] it
[00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:39.490] suggest?
[00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:42.170] What
[00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.450] happened
[00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:42.550] to
[00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:42.670] the
[00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:43.030] evolutionary
[00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.610] psychology?
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:48.320] It
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:48.720] disappeared
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.000] just
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:49.120] by
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:49.280] having
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:49.400] the
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:49.560] women
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:49.880] rotate
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.040] around
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:50.200] the
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:50.260] room.
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:50.580] It
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:51.000] suggests,
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:51.560] and
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:51.660] we
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:51.780] don't
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:51.940] know
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:52.080] this
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:52.300] with
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:52.580] certainty,
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:52.780] but
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:52.860] the
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:53.040] people
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:53.160] are
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:53.380] following
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:53.520] this
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:53.660] up
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:53.800] who
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:53.920] are
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.120] interested
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:54.220] in
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:54.340] this.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:54.840] It
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.160] suggests
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:55.340] that
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:55.960] there's
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:56.280] something
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:56.580] about
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:57.260] getting
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:57.540] up
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:57.780] and
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:58.360] approaching
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:58.660] that
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.040] person,
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:56:59.440] your
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:56:59.800] body
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.100] going,
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:00.340] here
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:00.460] I
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:00.740] come.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:02.280] I'm
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:02.400] not
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:02.640] sitting
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:02.760] in
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:02.920] my
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.300] chair,
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:03.920] hanging
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.420] out.
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:05.000] It's
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:05.180] like,
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.040] here
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:06.240] I
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:06.580] come.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.300] That
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:07.540] makes
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:07.680] a
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:07.940] person
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:08.860] energized,
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:09.740] feel
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:09.980] more
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:10.360] romantic,
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:10.860] feel
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.020] more
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.340] chemistry
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:11.520] is
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:11.800] happening,
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:12.140] and
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:12.280] more
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:12.500] likely
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:12.660] to
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:12.900] ask
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:13.020] on
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:13.140] a
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:13.280] date.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:13.480] And
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:13.600] it
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:13.880] doesn't
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.100] matter
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:14.300] whether
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:14.460] you're
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:14.540] a
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:14.720] man
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:14.860] or
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:14.960] a
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.140] woman
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:15.520] at
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:16.300] all.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:17.060] It's
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:17.180] the
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:17.440] getting
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:17.700] up
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:18.060] and
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:18.220] that
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:18.640] physical
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.100] approach,
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.260] you're
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:20.440] more
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:20.840] invested,
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.060] you're
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:21.160] more
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:21.360] out
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:21.520] there,
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:21.720] who
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:21.880] knows
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:22.040] what
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:22.160] it
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:22.420] is,
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.280] completely
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:23.900] eliminates
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:24.180] what
[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:24.480] everybody
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:24.660] had
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:24.900] said
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.220] is
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:25.400] an
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:25.920] ancient,
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:26.920] inevitable
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.700] evolutionary
[00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:28.220] difference
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:28.460] between
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:28.660] men
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:28.760] and
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:28.940] women.
[00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.850] And
[00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:29.990] this
[00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.210] isn't
[00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:30.310] to
[00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:30.430] say
[00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.550] there
[00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:30.710] might
[00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.850] not
[00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:31.010] be
[00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.190] some
[00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.310] of
[00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:31.490] those
[00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.950] streaks
[00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:32.090] in
[00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:32.250] us,
[00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:32.450] who
[00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:32.650] knows.
[00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:33.570] But
[00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:33.790] speed
[00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:34.050] dating
[00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:34.230] is
[00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.370] not
[00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:34.570] showing
[00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:34.710] that.
[00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:35.270] All
[00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.410] you've
[00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:35.430] got
[00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.510] to
[00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.590] do
[00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:35.630] is
[00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.730] have
[00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:35.830] the
[00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:36.010] women
[00:57:36.010 --> 00:57:36.390] rotate,
[00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:36.730] and
[00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:36.830] you
[00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:37.330] completely
[00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:37.730] eliminate
[00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.990] what's
[00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.110] thought
[00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:38.250] to
[00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:38.390] be
[00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.750] some
[00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:39.370] hardwired
[00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:39.870] biological
[00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:40.370] difference
[00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.790] on
[00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.910] this
[00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:41.190] dimension.
[00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:43.010] Now,
[00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.370] talking
[00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.590] about
[00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:43.810] that,
[00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:44.210] when
[00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.330] we
[00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:44.450] do
[00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.810] experiments
[00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:45.030] like
[00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.210] this
[00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:45.330] that
[00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:45.490] look
[00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:46.150] at
[00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.390] sort
[00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.490] of
[00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.750] fun
[00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:47.950] things
[00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:48.230] like
[00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.490] dating
[00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:48.770] around
[00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:48.950] a

[00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:50.170] or

[00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:51.050] difference
[00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:51.290] between

[00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:54.730] cultures,
[00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:54.970] there's
[00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:55.170] lots
[00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:55.290] of
[00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:55.690] experiments
[00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:55.850] that
[00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:56.290] compare,
[00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:57.030] say,
[00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.630] Western
[00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:58.110] cultures
[00:57:58.110 --> 00:57:58.590] versus

[00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:00.610] Asian
[00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:00.990] cultures.
[00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:01.190] We'll
[00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.350] talk
[00:58:01.350 --> 00:58:01.530] about
[00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:01.670] that
[00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.870] later
[00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.990] in
[00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.110] the
[00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:02.290] course
[00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:02.450] in
[00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.850] terms
[00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:02.950] of
[00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:03.370] behaviors.
[00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:04.090] Genes,
[00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:04.290] whether
[00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:04.390] you
[00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.490] have
[00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:04.690] one
[00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:04.890] gene
[00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:05.030] or
[00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.310] another.
[00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:06.370] All
[00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:06.610] those
[00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:06.990] things,
[00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.750] are
[00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:08.010] those
[00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:08.450] independent
[00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.930] variables?
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.080] We
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:15.560] can't
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.020] assign
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:16.240] you
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:16.660] randomly
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:16.920] to
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.040] be
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:17.160] a
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:17.340] man
[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:17.460] or
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:17.580] a
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:17.780] woman,
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:18.880] young
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:19.040] or
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.440] old,
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:20.160] to
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:20.500] come
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:20.680] from
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:20.820] the
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:21.060] United
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:21.440] States
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:21.620] or
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:21.860] Japan
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:22.100] or
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:22.420] China,
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:22.980] or
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:23.100] to
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:23.360] have
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:23.600] this
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:23.800] gene
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:23.920] or
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:24.160] that
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:24.440] gene.
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:25.500] It's
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:25.600] not
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:25.700] that
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:25.820] we
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:26.100] couldn't
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:26.300] do
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:26.660] stuff
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:28.320] in
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:28.520] some
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.040] monstrous
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:29.620] world,
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:29.800] but
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.200] not
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:30.600] ethically,
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:30.760] and
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:30.860] it's
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:31.020] never
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:31.180] going
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:31.260] to
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:31.500] happen,
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:31.740] right?
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:32.220] So
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.340] whenever
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:33.720] you
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:33.860] have
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:34.280] science
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:34.580] that
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:34.960] talks
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.200] about
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:35.540] differences
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:35.840] between
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:36.080] men
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:36.200] and
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:36.440] women,
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:36.580] or
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:36.840] young
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:36.960] and
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.300] old,
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:37.760] or
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.320] cultures
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:38.700] or
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:39.140] genes,
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:39.780] it's
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:40.060] not
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:40.400] really
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:40.540] a
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:40.900] completely
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:41.520] independent
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.160] manipulation.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:42.500] We
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:42.940] can't
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:43.320] assign
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:43.480] you
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:43.900] randomly.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:44.500] And
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:44.640] so
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:44.760] it
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:44.920] means
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:45.260] everything
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:45.480] in
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:45.600] the
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:45.840] world
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:46.100] about
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:46.260] what
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:46.360] it
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:46.520] means
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:46.640] to
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:46.740] be
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:46.840] a
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:47.000] man
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:47.120] or

[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:57.540] studies,
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:58.020] because

[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:00.320] We
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:00.460] just
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:01.120] can't.
[00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:02.790] And
[00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:03.070] I
[00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:03.230] didn't

[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:06.260] this
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:06.500] moment,
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:06.900] we've
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:07.280] made
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:07.600] every

[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:10.020] nature.
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:10.560] And
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:10.780] people
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:10.900] are
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.180] different,
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:11.360] one

[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:12.800] We'll
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.000] talk
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:13.160] about
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:13.300] that
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:13.480] later
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:13.580] in
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:13.680] the

[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:14.060] too.
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:15.280] So
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:15.720] for
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:15.800] the
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:15.920] last

[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:16.300] minutes,
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:16.420] I
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:16.500] want
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:16.580] to
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:16.720] talk
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:16.900] about

[00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:19.500] psychology.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:19.740] So
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:19.960] if

[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:08.260] going
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:08.300] to
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:08.420] tell
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:08.520] you
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:08.960] the
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.320] science
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:09.540] about
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:09.760] this.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:10.160] It's
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.380] best
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:10.520] to
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:10.700] stick
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:10.840] with
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:10.960] your
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.360] first
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:11.720] hunch.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:12.420] Practically
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:12.780] every
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:13.200] website
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:13.680] tells
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:13.820] you
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:14.020] that.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:14.160] Have
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:14.240] you
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:14.380] heard
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:14.520] that
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:14.700] many
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.040] times?
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:15.900] OK,
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:16.280] I'm
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:16.340] going
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:16.340] to
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:16.500] tell
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:16.600] you
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:16.720] what
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:16.880] the
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.160] actual
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:17.420] evidence
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:17.560] is
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:17.760] about
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:17.920] that
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.020] and
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:18.160] how
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:18.280] they
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:18.420] get
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:18.580] that
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:18.640] in
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:18.720] a
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:18.900] moment.
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:20.400] Ulcers
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:20.620] are
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:20.820] caused
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:21.160] primarily
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:21.420] by
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:21.760] stress.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:21.960] A
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.240] positive
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:22.520] attitude
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:22.760] can
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:22.960] stave
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.140] off
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:23.540] cancer.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.360] Raising
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:24.660] children
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.100] similarly
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:25.380] leads
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:25.680] to
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.320] similarities
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:26.480] in
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:26.560] their
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:26.800] adult
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.380] personalities.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.220] Low
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:29.500] self
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:29.720]-esteem
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:29.860] is
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:29.960] a
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.140] major
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:30.400] cause
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:30.500] of
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:30.960] psychological
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.420] problems.
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:31.880] People's
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:32.260] responses
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:32.460] on
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:32.580] the
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:32.900] inkblot
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:33.240] tests
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.480] tell
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:33.600] us
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:33.700] a
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:33.820] lot
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.000] about
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.200] their
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:34.680] personalities.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:35.960] Interviews
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:36.360] help
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:36.700] identify
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:36.920] those
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.100] most
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:37.380] likely
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:37.580] to
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:37.860] succeed
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:37.980] in
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.220] medical
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:38.560] school.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:45.160] OK,
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:47.060] I'll
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:47.200] give
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:47.280] you
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:47.380] a
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:47.480] minute.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.240] A
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:51.640] bunch
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:51.740] of
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:51.840] these
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:51.960] we'll
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:52.080] come
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:52.260] back
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:52.340] to
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:52.380] in
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:52.460] the
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:52.620] course.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.040] The
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:53.340] answer
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:53.480] for
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:53.640] all
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:53.800] these
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.020] is
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:54.720] this,
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:54.920] and
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.080] there's
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:55.400] evidence
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:55.620] to
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:55.740] it
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:55.880] all.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:56.020] So
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:56.480] I'm
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:56.500] going
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:56.540] to
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:56.640] tell
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:56.720] you
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:56.880] about
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.240] four
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:57.340] of
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:57.440] them
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.400] for
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:58.700] 10
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:00:58.880] minutes.
[01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:01.090] One
[01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:01.530] of
[01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:01.590] the
[01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:01.750] ones
[01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.850] you
[01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:01.990] might
[01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.170] want
[01:01:02.170 --> 01:01:02.250] to
[01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:02.390] know
[01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.630] most
[01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.870] about
[01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:03.050] is
[01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:03.930] changing
[01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:04.190] your
[01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.610] initial
[01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:04.870] hunch
[01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:05.230] answer.
[01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.550] OK,
[01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:05.670] how
[01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.810] do
[01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:05.910] you
[01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:06.130] know
[01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:06.450] that?
[01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:06.830] So
[01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:06.990] that
[01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:07.190] people
[01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.330] have
[01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:07.550] gone
[01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:07.870] back
[01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:08.050] over
[01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:08.310] test
[01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:08.490] scores
[01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:08.630] and
[01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.750] look
[01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.870] where
[01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:09.210] people
[01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:09.750] crossed
[01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.930] out
[01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:10.050] an
[01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:10.290] answer
[01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:10.510] or
[01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.810] erased
[01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:10.970] an
[01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:11.170] answer.
[01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.370] That's
[01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:11.490] the
[01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:11.650] best
[01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:11.870] source
[01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.990] of
[01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.190] evidence
[01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.350] they
[01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:12.550] have
[01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:12.650] in
[01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.910] large
[01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:13.250] samples.
[01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.730] And
[01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:14.010] people
[01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:14.370] are
[01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:14.650] twice
[01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:14.830] as
[01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:15.070] likely
[01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:15.410] to
[01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.890] give
[01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:16.390] the
[01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:17.230] correct
[01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:17.530] answer
[01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:17.650] than
[01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:17.810] to
[01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:17.990] move
[01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.110] to
[01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:18.190] a
[01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.330] wrong
[01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:18.630] answer.
[01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.550] That's
[01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:19.630] the
[01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.930] empirical
[01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:20.390] evidence.
[01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:22.030] So
[01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:22.470] it's
[01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.630] a
[01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:23.190] fantastically
[01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.730] interesting
[01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:24.210] disconnect
[01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:25.790] that
[01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:25.970] you
[01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:26.190] see
[01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:26.490] so
[01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:26.730] many
[01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:27.230] places
[01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.470] and
[01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.850] teachers
[01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:28.330] advise
[01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:28.570] you.
[01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:29.010] Go
[01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:29.310] with
[01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:29.470] your
[01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.790] first
[01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:30.050] hunch
[01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:30.230] when
[01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.390] you're
[01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.750] unsure.
[01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:31.470] The
[01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:32.170] empirical
[01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:32.590] evidence
[01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:32.910] is
[01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:33.410] you're
[01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.590] much
[01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:33.770] more
[01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:34.050] likely
[01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:34.490] to
[01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.630] be
[01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.950] correct
[01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:35.130] when
[01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:35.230] you
[01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.390] go
[01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.590] with
[01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:35.830] your
[01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:36.390] best
[01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.710] final
[01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:37.070] answer.
[01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:38.230] I
[01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.770] mean,
[01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:38.910] of
[01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:39.090] course,
[01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:40.250] you're
[01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.410] not
[01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:40.710] sure,
[01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:40.950] so
[01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:41.450] you're
[01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.530] going
[01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:41.610] to
[01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:41.750] miss
[01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.890] a
[01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:42.010] fair
[01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:42.230] bit.
[01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.570] But
[01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:42.770] you're
[01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:43.090] twice
[01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:43.250] as
[01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.470] likely
[01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:43.670] to
[01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.810] come
[01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:43.930] out
[01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:44.030] with
[01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:44.150] the
[01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.350] correct
[01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:44.570] answer
[01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:44.710] when
[01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.790] you
[01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:44.910] go
[01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:45.030] with
[01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.130] your
[01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:45.370] best
[01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:45.730] possible
[01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:46.070] answer.
[01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:47.090] So
[01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:47.190] that
[01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.350] people
[01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:47.510] who
[01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.830] crossed
[01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:48.090] out
[01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:48.210] their
[01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:48.530] answers
[01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.690] or
[01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:48.890] erased
[01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:49.010] their
[01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.330] answers,
[01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:49.750] they
[01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.830] were
[01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:50.110] twice
[01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:50.270] as
[01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.450] likely
[01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.650] to
[01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:50.930] move
[01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:51.070] to
[01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:51.190] a
[01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.290] good
[01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:51.590] answer
[01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:52.010] than
[01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.290] leave
[01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:52.830] behind
[01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:54.310] a
[01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:54.430] good
[01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.710] answer.
[01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:54.950] Yeah?
[01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:55.570] AUDIENCE
[01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.730] MEMBER
[01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.730] 2
[01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:56.030] You
[01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:56.330] know
[01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:56.570] that
[01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:56.910] maybe
[01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:57.110] it's
[01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:57.430] not
[01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:58.070] like
[01:01:58.070 --> 01:01:58.350] you
[01:01:58.350 --> 01:01:58.670] picked
[01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.810] an
[01:01:58.810 --> 01:01:59.250] answer
[01:01:59.250 --> 01:01:59.550] and
[01:01:59.550 --> 01:01:59.710] then
[01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.790] you
[01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:00.150] switched
[01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.350] their
[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:00.710] answer.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:01.380] And
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:01.520] then
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:01.780] taking
[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:01.980] the
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:02.340] advice
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:02.480] and
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:02.640] going
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:02.900] back
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:03.020] to
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:03.180] taking
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:03.380] the
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:03.480] advice.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:03.620] PROFESSOR
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:03.620] JOHN
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:03.620] GUTTAGEN
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:03.620] Yeah,
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:03.980] that's
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:04.080] an
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:04.320] excellent
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:04.540] question.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:04.660] We
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:04.760] don't
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:04.880] know.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.000] They
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:05.200] could
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:05.260] have
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:05.400] gone
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:05.580] like
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:05.880] five
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.160] times
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:06.380] back
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:06.520] and
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:06.780] forth.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:07.980] The
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:08.340] assumption
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:08.500] has
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:08.600] been,
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:08.760] on
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.120] average,
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:09.960] that
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.720] people
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:10.920] will
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:11.060] go
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:11.340] once
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:11.580] back
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:11.740] and
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:11.880] forth.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.020] But
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:12.160] you're
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:12.320] right.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:13.860] But
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:14.300] ask
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:14.540] yourself
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:14.680] the
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:14.820] other
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:15.060] question,
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:15.220] too.
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:15.420] What's
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:15.500] the
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:15.740] evidence
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.080] ever
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:16.720] that
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:16.920] going
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.060] with
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:17.160] your
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:17.400] hunch
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:17.600] is?
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:17.800] And
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.140] nobody's
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:18.260] been
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:18.400] able
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:18.540] to
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:18.680] show
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:18.860] that.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:19.760] So
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.160] where
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.360] there's
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:20.620] evidence,
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:20.780] it's
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:21.000] all
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:21.340] in
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:21.600] favor
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:21.940] of
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:22.540] best
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:22.920] answer.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:23.720] And
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.160] nobody's
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:24.260] shown
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:24.600] evidence
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.160] that
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:25.760] hunch
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.020] is
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:26.140] the
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:26.300] best
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:26.420] way
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:26.540] to
[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:26.940] go,
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:27.680] empirically.
[01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:28.870] That
[01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:29.070] doesn't
[01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:29.170] mean
[01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:29.310] that
[01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:29.630] sometimes
[01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.750] it
[01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.950] doesn't
[01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:30.190] happen.
[01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:30.390] But
[01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.590] on
[01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:30.950] average,
[01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:31.550] that's
[01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:31.610] the
[01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:31.710] way
[01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:31.810] that
[01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:31.850] it
[01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:31.950] ends.
[01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:32.250] But
[01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:32.410] your
[01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:32.930] point's
[01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:33.150] excellent.
[01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:33.850] OK.
[01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.510] So
[01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.990] how
[01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.110] about
[01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:35.550] Rorschach
[01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:35.850] tests?
[01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:36.410] Every
[01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:37.290] psychology
[01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:37.830] program,
[01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.390] clinical
[01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.910] psychologist
[01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:39.070] in
[01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:39.170] the
[01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.370] country
[01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:39.510] is
[01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.930] required
[01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:40.190] to
[01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.410] learn
[01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:40.790] how
[01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:40.910] to
[01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:41.290] administer
[01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:41.490] and
[01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:41.830] evaluate
[01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:41.970] a
[01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:42.150] Rorschach.
[01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:42.430] You
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.530] know
[01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.670] this?
[01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:43.070] So
[01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:43.410] this
[01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:43.950] obviously
[01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:44.470] shows
[01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:46.870] some
[01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:47.130] sort
[01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:47.270] of
[01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.850] horrible
[01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:48.170] sex
[01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.330] act
[01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:48.570] between
[01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:49.010] animals
[01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.210] and,
[01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:49.410] no.
[01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:53.690] No,
[01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.790] it's
[01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:54.930] a,
[01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.770] you
[01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:56.190] know
[01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:56.330] these
[01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:56.510] kinds
[01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.610] of
[01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:56.790] tests.
[01:02:56.830 --> 01:02:56.930] You're
[01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:57.030] supposed
[01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:57.090] to
[01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:57.330] read
[01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:57.490] it,
[01:02:57.550 --> 01:02:57.610] and
[01:02:57.610 --> 01:02:57.730] then
[01:02:57.730 --> 01:02:57.830] the
[01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:58.130] examiner
[01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:58.370] listens
[01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.570] to
[01:02:58.570 --> 01:02:58.630] you,
[01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.710] and
[01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.810] they
[01:02:58.810 --> 01:02:58.970] figure
[01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:59.210] out
[01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.530] something,
[01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.990] right?
[01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.530] OK.
[01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:01.750] There's
[01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.910] been
[01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:02.150] about
[01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.450] 10
[01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.870],000
[01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:03.370] publications
[01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:03.650] about
[01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.810] this.
[01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:03.930] There's
[01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:04.090] no
[01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:04.430] evidence
[01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.590] that
[01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:04.770] there's
[01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:05.250] anything
[01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:06.210] predictive
[01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:06.470] or
[01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.770] correct
[01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.950] about
[01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:07.110] this
[01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:07.310] test.
[01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:07.610] None,
[01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:07.870] zero,
[01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:08.210] none.
[01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:09.150] People
[01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.450] argue
[01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:09.610] it.
[01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:09.850] People
[01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:10.070] give
[01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:10.230] it.
[01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.970] People
[01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:11.510] have
[01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.670] to
[01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.910] learn
[01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:12.370] how
[01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:12.510] to
[01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.710] give
[01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.870] this
[01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:13.190] test.
[01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:14.050] So
[01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:14.190] this
[01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.290] is
[01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:14.410] a
[01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:14.710] disconnect
[01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.930] that
[01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:15.190] happens
[01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.330] a
[01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:15.470] lot
[01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.690] between
[01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:16.050] clinical
[01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:16.370] stuff
[01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.490] and
[01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.810] experimental
[01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:17.230] work.
[01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:17.590] I
[01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:17.730] mean,
[01:03:17.830 --> 01:03:17.950] those
[01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:18.770] researchers
[01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:19.610] can't
[01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:19.950] grasp
[01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:20.070] why
[01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:20.270] people
[01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.430] still
[01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.610] give
[01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:20.810] this.
[01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:22.690] Medical
[01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:22.950] school
[01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:23.230] interviews.
[01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:23.510] Those
[01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.650] of
[01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:23.750] you
[01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.850] who
[01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:23.970] will
[01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:24.190] apply
[01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.310] to
[01:03:24.310 --> 01:03:24.550] medical
[01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:24.930] school
[01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.510] will
[01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.710] get
[01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:29.050] interviews.
[01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.190] You
[01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.290] get
[01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:29.530] interviews
[01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:29.730] for
[01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:30.230] jobs.
[01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:30.390] You
[01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.450] get
[01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:30.690] interviews
[01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:30.910] for
[01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:31.050] all
[01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:31.250] kinds
[01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.350] of
[01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:31.510] things
[01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.630] in
[01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:31.730] your
[01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:31.930] life.
[01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:32.170] What's
[01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:32.230] the
[01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.470] evidence
[01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.590] that
[01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:32.850] interviews
[01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:33.030] are
[01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:33.270] any
[01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:33.410] good
[01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:33.570] for
[01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:33.890] anything?
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:36.820] How
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:37.080] could
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:37.220] you
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:37.420] know
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.340] whether
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:38.740] interviews
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:38.920] are
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.100] good
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:39.300] for
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:39.740] anything?
[01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:41.710] A
[01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:42.070] company
[01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:42.450] interviews
[01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:42.770] you.
[01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:43.090] A
[01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:43.510] university
[01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.910] interviews
[01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:44.270] you.
[01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:45.210] How
[01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:45.310] would
[01:03:45.310 --> 01:03:45.390] you
[01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:45.570] even
[01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:45.830] decide
[01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:45.970] whether?
[01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:46.390] So
[01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.610] I
[01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:46.730] can
[01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:46.850] tell
[01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:46.910] you
[01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:47.030] that
[01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:47.310] socialist
[01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:47.830] psychologists
[01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:48.110] have
[01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:48.270] shown
[01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:48.670] repeatedly
[01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:48.830] that
[01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:49.150] interviews
[01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.390] are
[01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:50.870] cesspools
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:51.640] for
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.140] discrimination,
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:52.420] because
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:52.680] people
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:52.900] tend
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.060] to
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:53.200] like
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:53.460] people
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:53.600] who
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:53.680] are
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:53.860] like
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:54.100] them.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:55.740] Oh,
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:55.860] you
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:56.020] went
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:56.120] to
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:56.420] MIT?
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:57.540] Course
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:57.840] nine?
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.060] Then
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:03:59.140] you
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:03:59.220] go,
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:03:59.340] oh,
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:03:59.520] man,
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:03:59.660] this
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:03:59.740] is
[01:03:59.740 --> 01:03:59.800] going
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:03:59.840] to
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:03:59.940] be
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:00.160] good,
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:00.360] right?
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:01.560] Or
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:01.860] I
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.020] went
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:02.140] to
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:02.480] Caltech.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:02.620] We
[01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:02.740] didn't
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:02.920] like
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:03.200] MIT
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:03.480] people.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:03.620] We
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:03.760] thought
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:03.880] they
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:03.960] were
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.040] a
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:04.180] little
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:04.400] bit
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:04.860] snobby
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:04.980] or
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:05.120] something.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:05.480] Oh,
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:05.780] that's
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:05.880] not
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.080] going
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:06.160] to
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:06.360] be
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:06.520] so
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:06.760] good.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:09.280] So
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:09.580] socialist
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:09.940] psychologists
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:10.080] have
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:10.180] shown
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:10.260] that
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:10.320] if
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:10.360] you
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:10.540] just
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:10.940] vary
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:11.420] information
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:11.600] in
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.020] practice
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:12.520] interviews,
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.040] people
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.020] tend
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:14.180] to
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:14.320] like
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:14.560] people
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:14.700] who
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:14.780] are
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:14.960] like
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.180] them
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:15.360] by
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:15.760] background,
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:16.020] by
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:16.340] appearance,
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:16.480] and
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:16.620] so
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:16.760] on.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:16.880] On
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:17.120] average,
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:17.280] they
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:17.460] try
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:17.660] not
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:17.760] to.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:17.860] They
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:18.040] try
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:18.140] to
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:18.260] be
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:18.520] fair.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:19.860] So
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:19.980] we
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.100] know
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:20.360] that.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:20.920] But
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.040] how
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:21.200] about
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:21.300] me?
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:21.520] OK,
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:21.900] so
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:22.080] here's
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:22.660] what
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:22.740] they
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:22.920] did.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.420] Yale
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:23.760] compared
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.140] students
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:24.240] who
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:24.340] were
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:24.680] accepted
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:24.800] or
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.040] rejected
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:25.140] on
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:25.220] the
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:25.400] basis
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:25.580] of
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:25.720] an
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.020] interview.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:26.380] So
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:26.480] they
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:26.740] all
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:26.960] had
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.300] scores
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:27.480] that
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:27.720] got
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:27.880] them
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.000] to
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:28.100] the
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:28.360] interview.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:29.420] And
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:29.540] then
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:29.900] they
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:30.080] looked
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:30.180] at
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:30.340] them
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:30.820] where
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:30.960] they
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.220] went
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:31.580] in
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:31.900] pairs
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.200] or
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:32.520] larger
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:32.700] than
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:32.920] pairs
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:33.080] to
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:33.260] other
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:33.540] medical
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:33.800] schools.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:33.980] So
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:34.220] let's
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:34.440] say
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:34.960] you
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:35.140] got
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:35.540] accepted
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:35.820] by
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.140] Yale,
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:36.900] and
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:36.980] you
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:37.080] were
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:37.440] accepted
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:37.640] or
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:37.920] rejected
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.080] on
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:38.160] the
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.380] interview,
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:38.980] but
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:39.100] you
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:39.280] ended
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:39.620] up
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:40.280] as
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:40.460] two
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:40.920] students
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.100] at
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:41.500] Penn
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:41.840] or
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.100] two
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:42.400] students
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:42.540] at
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:42.840] Michigan,
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:43.340] OK?
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:44.700] You're
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:44.880] sitting
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.100] next
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:45.200] to
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:45.300] each
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:45.460] other.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:46.800] One
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:46.900] of
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:46.980] you
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:47.120] was
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:47.420] accepted
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:47.640] by
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:47.920] interview
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.140] at
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:48.360] Yale,
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:48.620] one
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:48.760] of
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:48.900] you
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.120] was
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:49.360] not.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.060] Who
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:50.240] does
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:50.520] better
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:50.880] at
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:51.080] that
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:51.480] other
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:51.860] place?
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:53.480] They're
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:53.840] dead
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.140] even.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:54.820] The
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:55.140] interview
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:55.440] added
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:55.800] nothing
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.020] for
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:56.440] predicting
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:56.940] grade
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:57.160] point
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:57.620] average
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.180] or
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:58.580] completion
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:04:58.720] of
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:58.940] medical
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:04:59.260] school.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:00.480] Here's
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:00.620] one
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:00.760] more
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.120] example.
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:01.760] University
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:01.940] of
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:02.400] Texas
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.620] enlarged
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:03.940] in
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:04.080] the
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:04.360] midst
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:04.700] of
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:04.900] their
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:06.900] interviews,
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:07.700] it
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.140] enlarged
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:08.840] from

[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.140] students.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:10.920] They
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:11.040] had
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:11.480] interviewed
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.380] 800.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:13.320] The
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:13.860] 150
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:14.100] who
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:14.360] came
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:14.500] were
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:14.680] among
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:14.840] their
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:15.100] top
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:15.340] ones.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:15.480] They
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:15.740] interviewed
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:15.920] them.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.020] They
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:16.180] liked
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:16.300] them.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:16.400] They
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:16.680] came.
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:17.620] And
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:17.720] then
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:17.860] they
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.120] had,
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:18.280] and
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:18.420] all
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:18.500] of
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:18.560] a
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:18.700] sudden,
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:18.980] because
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.120] the
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:19.300] state
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:19.620] legislature
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:19.840] said,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:20.620] by
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:20.900] law,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:21.200] men
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:21.340] didn't
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:21.500] need
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:21.560] to
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:21.700] take
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:21.980] 50
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:22.240] more.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:22.560] They
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:22.720] took
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.000] 50
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.200] more
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:23.380] who
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:23.600] didn't
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:23.820] do
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:24.020] so
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:24.180] well
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:24.280] in
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:24.340] the
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:24.620] interview.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.080] Those
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:27.500] 50
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:27.840] more
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.460] performed
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.120] identically
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:29.820] to
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:29.960] the
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.260] ones
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:30.700] who
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:30.880] got
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.120] in
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:31.380] with
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:31.480] a
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:31.800] successful
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.160] interview.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:32.940] They
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.240] couldn't
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:33.620] find
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:33.860] a
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:34.100] difference
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:34.400] between
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:34.620] them.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.160] Now,
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:35.300] there's
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:35.400] at
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:35.520] least
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:35.960] one
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:36.200] thing
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:36.340] you
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:36.520] might
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:36.840] think
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:37.680] the
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:37.880] interview
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.240] might
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:38.420] have
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:38.720] done,
[01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:39.650] but
[01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:39.750] we
[01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.910] don't
[01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:40.110] know.
[01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:40.730] But
[01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:41.310] what
[01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:41.410] do
[01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:41.450] you
[01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.590] think
[01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:41.710] it
[01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.950] might
[01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:42.070] have
[01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:42.290] done?
[01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.870] So
[01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:43.170] the
[01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:43.510] outcome
[01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.770] was
[01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:44.350] your
[01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:44.730] grades
[01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:44.870] in
[01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:45.070] medical
[01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:45.350] school
[01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:45.530] and
[01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.670] your
[01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.930] likelihood
[01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:46.270] of
[01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:46.770] completing
[01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:47.070] medical
[01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:47.290] school.
[01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:47.490] What
[01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:47.710] else
[01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:48.110] could
[01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:48.230] an
[01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:48.470] interview
[01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.670] have
[01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.810] been
[01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:49.050] relevant
[01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:49.310] for?
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.300] Maybe,
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:52.760] maybe,
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:53.120] maybe
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.240] something
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:54.660] about
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:55.160] bedside
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:55.500] manner
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:55.820] or
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:55.960] how
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.080] you
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:56.300] relate
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:56.440] to
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:56.780] people.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:57.440] Maybe,
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:57.800] maybe,
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.140] maybe.
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:58.440] But
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:58.580] there's
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:58.720] no
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.000] evidence
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:05:59.140] that
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:05:59.340] that's
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:05:59.520] true.
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:00.240] Now
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.580] you're
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:00.720] starting
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:00.840] to
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:01.080] grasp
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:01.220] at
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:01.600] straws.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:02.260] So
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:02.420] there's
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:02.560] no
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:02.840] evidence
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:02.960] that
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.180] interview
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:03.600] processes
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:03.920] make
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:04.120] any
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:04.340] difference
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:04.640] anywhere,
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.000] but
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:05.360] everybody
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:05.600] does
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:05.980] interviews
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.380] all
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:06.520] the
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:06.660] ways,
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:06.900] because
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:07.560] we
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:07.740] always
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:07.880] think
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.000] we're
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.120] kind
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:08.200] of
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:08.380] good
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:08.600] judges
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:08.780] of
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:08.960] human
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.220] nature
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:09.440] or
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:09.740] something.
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.180] So
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:11.600] interviews,
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.320] it's
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:12.520] very
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:12.740] hard
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:12.880] to
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.020] tell
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:13.140] that
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:13.260] they
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:13.560] ever
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:13.760] do
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:13.980] anything.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:14.220] So
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:14.440] here's
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:14.580] my
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:14.840] last
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.240] thing.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:15.820] Self
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.080]-esteem.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.060] You
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:17.440] cannot
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:17.980] watch
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:18.760] Oprah
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.000] or
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:19.240] Dr.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:19.440] Phil
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:19.700] without
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.080] some
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:20.420] discussion
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:20.560] of
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:20.760] self
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:20.980]-esteem
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:21.120] at
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:21.260] some
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:21.540] moment.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:22.500] And
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:22.600] it
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:22.800] sounds
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:22.960] good
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:23.080] to
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:23.360] everybody.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:23.560] I
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:23.640] mean,
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:23.840] nobody
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.040] would
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:24.200] wish
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:24.340] for
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:24.460] you,
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:24.560] as
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:24.680] a
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:24.920] parent
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.080] or
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:25.280] friend,
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:25.440] for
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:25.500] you
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:25.540] to
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:25.640] have
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:25.860] low
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:26.100] self
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:26.380]-esteem.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.240] And
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:27.380] in
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:27.520] fact,
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:27.860] higher
[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.380] self
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:28.600]-esteem
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:28.840] is
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.120] correlated
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:29.440] with
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:29.900] higher
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.260] initiative
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:30.440] and
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:30.820] persistence,
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:31.380] happiness,
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:31.620] and
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:31.900] emotional
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.300] resilience,
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:32.580] and
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:33.220] also,
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:33.760] unfortunately,
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:34.240] with
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:34.460] people
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:34.580] who
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:34.660] are
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:35.220] narcissistic
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:35.400] and
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:35.780] bullies.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.320] And
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:39.640] how
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:39.820] they
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:40.100] measure
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:40.280] it,
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:40.440] just
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:40.580] so
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:40.680] you
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:40.940] know,
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:41.260] because
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:41.420] this
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:41.500] is
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:41.620] a
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:41.860] problem,
[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.080] too,
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:42.240] like
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:42.360] how
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:42.460] do
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:42.540] you
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:42.740] measure
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:42.880] it?
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:44.760] There's
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.000] several
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:45.300] scales,
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:45.440] but
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:45.560] the
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:45.740] most
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.240] widely
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:46.460] used
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:46.680] scale
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:46.800] is
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:46.960] this
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.440] Rosenberg
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:47.740] scale,
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:48.060] so
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:48.200] you
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:48.360] have
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:48.500] that,
[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:48.660] too,
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:48.760] if
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:48.840] you
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:48.960] want
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:49.340] to
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:49.540] try
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:49.660] it
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:49.760] out
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:49.860] on

[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:52.180]-report.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:53.480] And
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:53.620] when
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:53.740] they
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:54.000] reviewed
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:54.420] 15

[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.100] studies
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:55.300] some
[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:55.480] years
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:55.700] ago,
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:55.840] they
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:55.980] could
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:56.180] find
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:56.420] no
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:56.860] evidence
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:57.500] that
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:57.880] higher
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.200] self
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:58.520]-esteem
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.140] leads
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:06:59.300] to
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:06:59.480] better
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:06:59.920] things.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:00.500] It

[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.440] and
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.340] counterproductive
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:45.600] it

[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:52.960] And

[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:53.900] one
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:54.120] sentence,

[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:58.840] question
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:58.980] than
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:07:59.200] that?
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:07:59.960] Wherever
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.160] you

[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:03.560] I'll
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:03.680] just

[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:08.040] pretty
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:08.260] hard
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:08.640] task.
[01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:09.770] And
[01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:10.210] afterwards,
[01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:11.330] randomly,
[01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.590] they
[01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:11.690] were
[01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.890] either
[01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:12.250] praised
[01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:12.410] for
[01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.550] their
[01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:13.010] intelligence,
[01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:13.230] so
[01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.330] a
[01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:13.450] person
[01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:13.650] said
[01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:13.790] to
[01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:14.010] them,
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:15.140] you
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:15.700] fifth
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:15.980] grader,
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:16.660] you
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:16.820] are
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.180] so
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:17.500] smart.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:17.640] I
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:17.900] can't
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.120] believe
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:18.260] how
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:18.500] great
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:18.620] you
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:18.740] did
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:18.860] on
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:19.000] that.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:20.580] Or
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:20.980] they
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:21.100] were
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:21.300] praised
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:21.420] for
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:21.540] their
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:21.700] hard
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:21.960] work.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:22.360] This
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:22.640] shows
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:22.800] a
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:22.900] lot
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:22.980] of
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:23.180] hard
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:23.460] work.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:23.960] Different
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.240] kid.
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:24.400] And
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:24.560] some
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:24.700] kids
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:24.820] got
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:25.000] no
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:25.160] praise
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:25.260] at
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.020] all
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.420] in
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:27.600] this
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.040] experiment.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:28.980] Now,
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:29.580] then
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:29.740] they
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:29.980] get
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:30.640] a
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:31.280] task
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:31.440] that's
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:31.580] even
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:31.720] a
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:31.840] little
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.000] bit
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:32.240] harder.
[01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.990] How
[01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.250] does
[01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:34.390] the
[01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.590] different
[01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.810] kind
[01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:34.930] of
[01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:35.210] praise
[01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:35.690] influence
[01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:35.950] things?
[01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:36.070] And
[01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.190] here
[01:08:36.190 --> 01:08:36.330] was
[01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:36.450] the
[01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:36.710] finding.
[01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:37.690] If
[01:08:37.690 --> 01:08:37.790] you
[01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:37.930] were
[01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:38.350] praised
[01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:38.650] for
[01:08:38.650 --> 01:08:38.810] your
[01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:39.270] intelligence,
[01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:39.970] you
[01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:40.210] did
[01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:40.750] worse
[01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:41.110] on
[01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.210] the
[01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:41.430] second
[01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.770] test.
[01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:42.090] If
[01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:42.170] you
[01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:42.310] were
[01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:42.810] praised
[01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:42.990] for
[01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:43.090] your
[01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:43.290] hard
[01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:43.510] work,
[01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.610] you
[01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:43.730] did
[01:08:43.730 --> 01:08:44.010] better.
[01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:44.490] If
[01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:44.750] nobody
[01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:44.950] said
[01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:45.270] anything,
[01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:45.710] your
[01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:46.030] performance
[01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.290] didn't
[01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:46.630] change.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:47.600] And
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:47.780] the
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.120] idea
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:48.320] is
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:48.440] this.
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:48.620] You
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:48.860] understand?
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.260] Praised
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:49.380] for

[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:50.060] you
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:50.220] did
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:50.640] worse
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.040] on
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:51.120] a
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:51.280] hard
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:51.620] task.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:51.920] Praised
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.060] for
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:52.180] your

[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:52.620] you
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:52.720] did
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:52.980] better.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:53.440] And
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:53.620] here's
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:53.740] the
[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:54.020] idea.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.000] That
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.660] if
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:55.820] we
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:56.180] praise
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:56.500] people
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:56.680] for
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:56.840] their

[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:57.540] to
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:57.720] build
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:57.840] up
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:57.960] their

[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:58.480]-esteem,
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:08:59.200] they
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:08:59.400] start
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:08:59.560] to
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:08:59.740] care
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:00.100] more
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:00.380] about
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:00.820] how

[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:01.540] performance
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:01.980] reflects
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:02.220] on
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:02.520] them
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:02.980] than
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:03.120] the
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:03.520] performance
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.040] itself.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:05.860] Because
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:06.320] you're
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:06.560] trying
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:06.700] to
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:07.100] prove

[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:08.920] You
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:09.100] care
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:09.420] less.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:10.320] The
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:10.600] students
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:10.760] who
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:10.900] get

[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.080] they
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:13.420] persist
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:13.720] less
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:13.860] in
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:13.940] a
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.200] difficult
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:14.660] task.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.200] They
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:15.400] say
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:15.780] they
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.200] don't
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:16.540] enjoy
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:17.080] challenges.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:17.780] Why?
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:18.220] They
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:18.360] just
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:18.500] want

[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:19.940] they're
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:20.200] smart.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:22.300] The
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:22.640] kids
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:22.780] who

[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:23.160] praised
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:23.320] for
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:23.620] effort,
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:24.440] they're
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:24.580] kind
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:24.640] of
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:24.780] like,
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:24.980] OK,
[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:25.140] I'm
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:25.200] going
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:25.260] to
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:25.420] make
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:25.540] some
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:25.900] mistakes.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:26.160] But
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:26.260] I'm
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:26.400] just

[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:26.940] going.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.060] Because
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:27.180] with
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:27.400] effort,
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:27.500] I
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:27.620] can
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:27.760] do
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:27.960] things
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:28.320] sometimes.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:29.220] And
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:29.340] it
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:29.580] turns
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:29.760] out
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:29.860] that
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:29.940] it
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:30.080] makes
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:30.180] a
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:30.540] remarkable
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:30.900] thing.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:31.300] And
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:31.520] so
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:31.920] Dweck,
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:32.040] and
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:32.060] we'll
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:32.200] come
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:32.360] back
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:32.440] to
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:32.580] this,
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:32.980] talks
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:33.200] about
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:33.420] you
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:33.540] can
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:33.800] view
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.060] your
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:34.540] intelligence
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:34.800] as
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:34.940] a
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:35.260] trait.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:36.060] I
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:36.180] have
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:36.360] only
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:36.580] so
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:36.920] much.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:37.880] Or
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.240] as
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:38.380] a
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:38.760] growth.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:39.500] The
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:39.820] harder
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:40.040] I
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:40.240] work,
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:40.400] the
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:40.680] smarter
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:40.900] I
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:41.060] get.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:41.240] But
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:41.360] I
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:41.500] have
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:41.580] to
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:41.660] do
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:41.760] the
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:41.940] hard
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:42.200] work
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:42.520] to
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:42.680] get
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:42.900] there.
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:43.320] And
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:43.980] we
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:44.200] live
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:44.300] in
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:44.420] a
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:44.720] society
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:44.900] that
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:45.160] often
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:45.440] goes
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:45.780] by
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:47.100] fixed
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:47.640] traits.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:48.520] American
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:48.800] Idol.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.040] The
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:50.240] harder
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:50.400] the
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:50.560] work,
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:50.700] the
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:50.860] better
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:51.000] you
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:51.260] sing?
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:51.840] Or
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.020] who
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:52.200] has
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:52.320] the
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:52.620] talent
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:52.760] that's
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.040] discovered?
[01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:54.870] Who
[01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:55.050] has
[01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:55.170] the
[01:09:55.170 --> 01:09:55.390] talent
[01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.570] that's
[01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:55.850] discovered,
[01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:56.090] right?
[01:09:57.710 --> 01:09:58.150] Because
[01:09:58.150 --> 01:09:58.330] the
[01:09:58.330 --> 01:09:58.590] idea
[01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:58.930] is
[01:09:58.930 --> 01:09:59.290] you
[01:09:59.290 --> 01:09:59.650] have
[01:09:59.650 --> 01:09:59.750] a
[01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.910] certain
[01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:00.150] amount
[01:10:00.150 --> 01:10:00.250] of
[01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:00.490] musical
[01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:00.890] talent,
[01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.110] and
[01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.270] now
[01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.430] the
[01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.610] judges
[01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.910] show,
[01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.050] and
[01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:02.150] you
[01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:02.470] break
[01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.630] into
[01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.790] the
[01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.990] world,
[01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.150] and
[01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:03.250] you're
[01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:03.390] a
[01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:03.650] famous
[01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:03.890] singer.
[01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:05.750] So
[01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:06.030] ask
[01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.310] yourself
[01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.670] this.
[01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:08.670] When
[01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:08.830] you
[01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.970] are
[01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:09.230] good
[01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:09.350] at
[01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.490] what
[01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:09.630] you
[01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.970] do,
[01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:10.390] is
[01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.530] it
[01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:10.930] because
[01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:11.490] something
[01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:11.670] in
[01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:11.830] your
[01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:12.110] genes
[01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.250] or
[01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:12.310] in
[01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.390] an
[01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.710] environment
[01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:13.090] made
[01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:13.230] you
[01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:13.450] good
[01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:13.590] at
[01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.850] it,
[01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:14.390] or
[01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.470] is
[01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.550] it
[01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.670] because
[01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:14.790] you
[01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.990] try
[01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.210] really
[01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:15.550] hard?
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:16.740] So
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.340] Malcolm
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:17.720] Gladwell
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:17.920] has
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.160] this
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:18.660] statement
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:18.940] that's
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.160] floating
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:19.460] around,
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:19.700] gets
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:19.860] a
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:19.920] lot
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:20.020] of
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:20.340] attention,
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:20.960] that
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:21.260] anybody
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:21.580] can
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:21.860] become
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:22.220] great
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:22.360] at
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:22.680] anything
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:22.900] if
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:23.000] they
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:23.180] work
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:23.300] on
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:23.400] it
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:23.540] for
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:23.860] 10
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.300],000
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:24.680] hours.
[01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:27.190] So
[01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:27.470] how
[01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.850] much
[01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:28.090] of
[01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:28.270] your
[01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.630] success
[01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.930] in
[01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:29.050] the
[01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:29.470] past,
[01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:29.910] currently,
[01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:30.030] and
[01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:30.130] the
[01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:30.330] future
[01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:30.470] is
[01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.570] going
[01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:30.590] to
[01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.710] be
[01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:30.950] based
[01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:31.190] on
[01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:31.690] your
[01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:32.230] effort?
[01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:33.130] And
[01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:33.390] how
[01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:33.610] much
[01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:33.710] is
[01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:33.790] it
[01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:33.850] going
[01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:33.850] to
[01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:33.970] be
[01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:34.230] based
[01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:34.410] on
[01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:34.670] your
[01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:35.470] talents?
[01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:36.150] And
[01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:36.350] how
[01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.510] would
[01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:36.650] we
[01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:36.810] know
[01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:37.030] that?
[01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:37.150] And
[01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:37.510] we're
[01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.610] a
[01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:37.750] very
[01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:38.170] talent
[01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:38.510]-oriented
[01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:39.130] society.
[01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:40.770] And
[01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:40.890] it
[01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:41.090] seems
[01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:41.350] like
[01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.830] the
[01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.950] more
[01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:42.070] we
[01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.410] encourage
[01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.810] effort,
[01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:43.070] maybe,
[01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.210] the
[01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:43.370] more
[01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.590] people
[01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.770] might
[01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:44.170] flourish.
[01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.710] So
[01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:44.830] we
[01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:45.050] talked
[01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.390] about
[01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:45.690] how
[01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:46.170] psychology
[01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:46.350] and
[01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.790] science
[01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:47.650] experiments,
