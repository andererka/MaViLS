[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.420] Okay,
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.740] so
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.980] let's
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.140] start
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.320] back
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.620] up.
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.860] Today,
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.460] let's
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.560] see,
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.720] we
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.860] are
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.280] transitioning
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.880] from
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.020] morphology
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.340] into
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.740] phonetics.
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.480] So
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.780] I
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.920] hope
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.040] you
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.320] enjoyed
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.920] morphology.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.200] It's
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.340] not
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.480] as
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.700] if
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.960] you
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.160] won't
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.360] ever
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.500] do
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.680] any
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.100] morphology
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.400] again,
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.620] but
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.980] that's
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.220] it
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.540] for
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.200] lessons
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.420] on
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.900] morphology.
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.800] Lectures,
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.000] I
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.200] guess.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.480] Today
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.700] is
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.080] phonetics,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.300] which
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.520] means
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.700] that
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.040] today
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.500] we
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.760] begin
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.040] making
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.320] funny
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.640] sounds
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.780] at
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.940] each
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.080] other.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.980] So
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.760] everybody
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.060] limber
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.200] up
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.320] your
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.540] vocal
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.880] tracts.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.300] Let's
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.460] see,
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.640] I'm
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.780] trying
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.900] to
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.160] remember
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.680] if
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.880] there's
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.160] anything
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.420] that
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.540] I
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.680] ought
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.840] to
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.240] announce.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.320] You
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.740] remember
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.020] maybe
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.300] that
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.900] problem
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.140] set
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.480] one,
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.800] which
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.400] confusingly
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.580] is
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.740] your
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.960] second
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.280] problem
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.540] set,
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.480] is
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.800] due
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.300] on
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.720] Thursday.
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.300] Normally
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.480] it
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.580] would
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.700] be
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.020] due
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.160] on
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.380] Tuesday,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.800] but
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.420] because
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.620] I
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.800] am
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.520] technologically
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.120] challenged,
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.700] it's
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.840] due
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.000] on
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.340] Thursday.
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.440] Speaking
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.580] of
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.720] being
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.200] technologically
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.580] challenged,
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.780] I
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.960] just
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.200] figured
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.380] out
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.500] how
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.820] to
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.060] get
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.240] the
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.620] projector
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.860] to
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.140] project
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.500] over
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.760] there
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.040] instead
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.180] of
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.260] in
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.380] the
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.500] middle
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.980] so
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.100] that
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.200] I
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.340] won't
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.500] have
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.600] to
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.760] write
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.040] everything
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.380] twice
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.640] running
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.820] back
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.920] and
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.060] forth
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.300] across
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.420] the
[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.540] room.
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.940] So
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.420] thank
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.520] you.
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.800] I'm
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.920] going
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.020] to
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.260] mention
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.520] this
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.680] when
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.780] I
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.920] go
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.120] up
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.300] for,
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.480] you
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.620] know,
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.120] my
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.400] chair
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.560] is
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.740] trying
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.900] to
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.180] decide
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.340] whether
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.460] to
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.580] give
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.700] me
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.840] a
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.060] raise.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.220] I'll
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.320] be
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.500] like,
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.720] big
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.120] academic
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.560] achievements
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.800] of
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.900] the
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.100] year.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.260] I
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.420] was
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.400] figuring
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.920] out
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.080] the
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.280] technique.
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.200] So
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.460] if
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.740] anybody
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.140] misses
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.400] the
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.560] old
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.780] days,
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.000] like
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.140] you
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.280] were
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.640] amused
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.980] watching
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.140] me
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.300] run
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.460] back
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.580] and
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.800] forth
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.280] or
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.500] this
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.780] turns
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.920] out
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.000] to
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.100] be
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.260] too
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.580] small
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.780] or
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.000] something
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.240] like
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.460] that,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.140] let
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.280] me
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.460] know
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.620] and
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.020] we'll
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.360] go
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.540] back
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.660] to
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.760] the
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.880] old
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.100] days.
[00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.310] So
[00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.810] when
[00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.130] we
[00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.890] speak,
[00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.270] if
[00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.410] we're
[00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.790] speaking
[00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.590] an
[00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.830] oral
[00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.250] language,
[00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.430] if
[00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.530] we're
[00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.750] not
[00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.150] signing,
[00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.050] what
[00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.210] we
[00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.350] are
[00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.650] typically
[00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.130] doing
[00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.550] is
[00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.010] producing
[00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.250] a
[00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.410] flow
[00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.610] of
[00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.870] air,
[00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.490] which
[00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.890] typically
[00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.210] comes
[00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.370] out
[00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.470] of
[00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.630] your
[00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.910] lungs,
[00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.130] but
[00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.330] not
[00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.810] necessarily.
[00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.130] We'll
[00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.330] talk
[00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.490] about
[00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.770] that.
[00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.290] And
[00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.470] it
[00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.770] gets
[00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.450] obstructed
[00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.630] in
[00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.970] various
[00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.530] ways
[00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.510] in
[00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.690] the
[00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.930] vocal
[00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.390] tract.
[00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.870] And
[00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.190] so
[00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.710] one
[00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.490] standard
[00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.750] way
[00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.870] of
[00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.090] talking
[00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.390] about
[00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.050] different
[00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.290] kinds
[00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.390] of
[00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.570] speech
[00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.870] sounds
[00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.070] is
[00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.170] to
[00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.390] talk
[00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.010] about
[00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.450] where
[00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.870] in
[00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.990] the
[00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.170] vocal
[00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.590] tract
[00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.110] things,
[00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.490] the
[00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.870] flow
[00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.010] of
[00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.070] air
[00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.230] can
[00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.390] get
[00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.870] obstructed
[00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.010] and
[00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.350] how.
[00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.050] And
[00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.270] that's
[00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.430] what
[00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.570] we're
[00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.010] going
[00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.110] to
[00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.230] kind
[00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.310] of
[00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.450] do.
[00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.630] So
[00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.810] first
[00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.950] we'll
[00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.150] talk
[00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.370] about
[00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.610] where.
[00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.270] So
[00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.590] one
[00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.870] way
[00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.990] of
[00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.570] categorizing
[00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.310] the
[00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.650] various
[00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.950] things
[00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.130] that
[00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.250] your
[00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.450] vocal
[00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.770] tract
[00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.270] does
[00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.850] to
[00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.330] the
[00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.090] airflow
[00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.110] is
[00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.310] by
[00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.550] what's
[00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.690] called
[00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.970] place
[00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.090] of
[00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.730] articulation.
[00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.970] That
[00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.070] is
[00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.330] where
[00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.530] in
[00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.750] your
[00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.350] vocal
[00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.670] tract
[00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.270] is
[00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.430] the
[00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.590] flow
[00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.690] of
[00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.790] air
[00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.090] getting
[00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.830] obstructed.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.420] So
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.660] for
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.920] example,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.640] there
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.940] are
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.340] what
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.440] are
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.660] called
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.320] bilabial
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.080] sounds.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.580] These
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.720] are
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.060] sounds
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.240] which
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.360] are
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.540] made
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.720] with
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.960] both
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.320] lips.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.720] This
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.220] picture
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.420] over
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.560] here
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.660] on
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.760] the
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.940] right
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.280] is
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.660] what's
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.760] called
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.900] a
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.260] sagittal
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.620] section.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.820] That
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.960] is,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.100] it's
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.200] a
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.380] picture
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.540] of
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.980] someone's
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.220] head
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.720] cut
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.900] in
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.220] half
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.280] so
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.800] that
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.860] you
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.000] can
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.240] see
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.460] the
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.640] stuff
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.880] that's
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.260] inside.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.520] And
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.060] those
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.400] arrows
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.620] are
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.740] meant
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.260] to
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.640] get
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.740] you
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.900] to
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.240] imagine
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.760] that
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.340] this
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.580] person
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.780] is
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.060] making
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.280] a
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.500] sound
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.720] by
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.940] putting
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.120] their
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.320] two
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.560] lips
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.920] together.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.420] So
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.640] that's
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.760] what
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.860] you
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.100] do
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.280] for
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.460] the
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.800] sounds
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.000] that
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.080] are
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.220] at
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.340] the
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.660] beginnings
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.980] of
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.280] words
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.560] like
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.940] paint
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.460] and
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.020] bath

[00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.890] wipe,
[00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.190] where
[00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.370] your
[00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.530] lips
[00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.770] don't
[00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.050] touch
[00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.230] but
[00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.370] they
[00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.570] both
[00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.050] move.
[00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.730] Everybody
[00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.970] feel
[00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:05.150] free
[00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.310] to
[00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.650] confirm

[00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.870] in
[00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.970] the
[00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.290] privacy
[00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.590] of
[00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.710] your
[00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.910] own
[00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.270] mask
[00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.210] that
[00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.430] that
[00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.550] is
[00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.710] what
[00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.870] you're
[00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.070] doing
[00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.230] when
[00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.310] you
[00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.470] make
[00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.690] these
[00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.970] sounds.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.140] Now,
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.720] next
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.860] to
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.980] the
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.360] sounds,
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.020] so
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.160] I
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.240] have
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.380] these
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.720] words,
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.020] paint,
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.720] bath,
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.000] mouth

[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.340] wipe,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.760] and

[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.180] next
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.320] to
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.420] them
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.520] I
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.620] have
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.940] these
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.800] symbols
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.060] in
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.360] brackets.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.040] And
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.180] they
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.300] may
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.420] not
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.580] look
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.700] at
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.780] it,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.900] but
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.060] these
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.180] are
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.600] extremely
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.060] technical
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.460] symbols.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.720] These
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.860] are
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.260] symbols
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.600] of
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.820] the
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.280] International
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.740] Phonetic
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.140] Alphabet.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.140] So
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.960] linguists
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.320] have
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.460] a
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.740] system
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.980] for
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.260] writing
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.840] sounds
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.240] down
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.520] so
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.720] that
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.200] we'll
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.380] all
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.600] know
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.800] what
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.980] kind
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.060] of
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.240] sound
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.420] we're
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.660] talking
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.900] about
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.080] when
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.340] we're
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.880] talking
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.160] about
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.560] sounds.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.420] And,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.260] bless
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.440] you,
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.880] a
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.020] lot
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.180] of
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.500] the
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.780] symbols
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.940] of
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.040] the
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.340] International
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.020] Phonetic
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.260] Alphabet
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.640] resemble
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.240] letters
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.520] of
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.720] the
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.920] English
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.180] alphabet.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.460] So
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.620] we
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.740] have
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.980] started
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:44.300] here
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.620] with
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.940] symbols
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.180] that
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.380] should
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.540] all
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.740] look
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.920] kind
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.000] of
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.240] familiar.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.600] So
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.900] the
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.340] symbol
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.820] for
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.400] the
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.720] sound
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.900] at
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.020] the
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.240] beginning
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.480] of
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.800] paint
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.420] is
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.580] the
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.840] letter
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.180] P.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.140] So
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.820] that's
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.980] a
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.680] symbol
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.860] of
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.940] the
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.300] International
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.680] Phonetic
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.960] Alphabet.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.560] As
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.660] we
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.780] go
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.040] along,
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.180] we
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.280] will
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.400] be
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.600] seeing
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.920] weirder
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.060] and
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.320] weirder
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.680] symbols
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.920] from
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.040] the
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.380] International
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.760] Phonetic
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.000] Alphabet,
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.340] so
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.600] please
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.020] enjoy
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.200] it
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.360] while
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.560] it's
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.820] easy.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.740] So
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.980] far
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.500] so
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.660] good.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.460] There
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.600] are
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.840] also
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.980] what
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.060] are
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.260] called
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.940] labiodental
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.660] sounds.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.620] Labiodental
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.060] sounds
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.740] involve
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.140] your
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.720] top
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.100] teeth
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.420] and
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.580] your
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.860] lower
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.200] lip.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.720] If
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.820] you
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.960] think
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.120] about
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.240] what
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.360] you're
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.600] doing
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.720] at
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.820] the
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.020] beginning
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.200] of
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:16.280] a
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.460] sound
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.700] like
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.440] face
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.400] or
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.320] vase,
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.440] what
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.600] you're
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.040] doing,
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.220] at
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.380] least
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.540] if
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.720] you're
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.020] me,
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.920] is
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.580] bringing
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.900] your
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.160] lower
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.400] lip
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.720] pretty
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.060] close
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.240] to
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.400] your
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.640] upper
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.020] teeth
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.680] and
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.300] obstructing
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.440] the
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.640] flow
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.820] of
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.960] air
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.260] there
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.540] so
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.720] that
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.980] there's
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.180] some
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.620] turbulence.
[00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.730] There
[00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.030] are,
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.220] I
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.460] believe,
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.720] no
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.100] languages
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.780] in
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.940] which
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.620] labiodentals
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.800] are
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.040] made
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.220] with
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.460] your
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.820] bottom
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.240] teeth
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.420] and
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.580] your
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.880] upper
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.280] lip.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.700] It's
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.820] a
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.940] little
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.220] hard
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.420] to
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.560] do
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.200] face.
[00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.050] We'll
[00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.350] talk
[00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.890] about
[00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.170] other
[00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.510] kinds
[00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.690] of
[00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.950] places
[00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.130] of
[00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.590] articulation
[00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.790] that
[00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.010] English
[00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.330] doesn't
[00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.590] use,
[00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.730] but
[00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.830] I
[00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.950] think
[00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.110] that
[00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.250] one
[00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.470] just
[00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.710] doesn't.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.660] And
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.900] again,
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.280] two
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.660] symbols
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.840] of
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.960] the
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.360] IPA,
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.600] which
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.880] again
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.200] are
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.700] not
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.860] going
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.940] to
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.020] be
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.140] too
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.280] hard
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.400] for
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.480] you
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.600] to
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.780] learn.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.980] Yeah,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.260] so
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.660] the
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.880] symbol
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.120] for
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.720] the
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.940] sound
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.060] at
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.160] the
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.320] beginning
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.500] of
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.720] face
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.940] is
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.080] an
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.320] F,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.580] and
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.680] the
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.860] symbol
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.000] for
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.120] the
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.260] sound
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.360] at
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.480] the
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.640] beginning
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.820] of
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.000] vase
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.240] is
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.720] a
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.840] V.
[00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.490] Here
[00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.590] we
[00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.730] get
[00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.870] our
[00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.090] first
[00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.510] two
[00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.210] IPA
[00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.610] symbols
[00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.870] that
[00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.990] are
[00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.310] not
[00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.210] letters
[00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.390] of
[00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.470] the
[00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.670] English
[00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.030] alphabet.
[00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.070] These
[00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.230] are
[00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.790] interdental
[00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.370] sounds.
[00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.730] Interdental
[00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.050] sounds
[00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.210] are
[00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.390] cross
[00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.830]-linguistically
[00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.270] not
[00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.710] hugely
[00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.090] common.
[00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.230] We
[00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.390] have
[00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.490] them
[00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.590] in
[00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.930] English.
[00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.430] There
[00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.790] are
[00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.030] various
[00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.330] dialects
[00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.410] of
[00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.570] Arabic
[00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.790] that
[00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.950] have
[00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.170] them.
[00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.090] Some
[00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.150] of
[00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.230] the
[00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.430] Berber
[00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.790] languages
[00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.030] have
[00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.170] them,
[00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.530] but
[00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.690] they're
[00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.930] not
[00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.970] all
[00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.350] that
[00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.590] common.
[00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.470] These
[00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.590] are
[00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.790] the
[00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.070] sounds
[00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.190] at
[00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.290] the
[00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.530] beginnings
[00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.790] of
[00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.950] words
[00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.210] like
[00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.670] thistle
[00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.230] and
[00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.730] this,
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.100] where
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.300] you're
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.520] sticking
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.740] your
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.900] tongue
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.200] between
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.520] your
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.820] front
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.140] teeth
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.280] and
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.100] making
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.840] air
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.040] flow
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.260] out.
[00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.110] English
[00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.810] doesn't
[00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.290] spell
[00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.730] these
[00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.230] differently,
[00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:40.170] at
[00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.170] least
[00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.410] not
[00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.910] reliably.
[00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.570] So
[00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.710] we
[00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.930] spell
[00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.190] both
[00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.310] of
[00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.450] these
[00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.610] with
[00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.710] a
[00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.930] TH.
[00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.730] That's
[00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.850] one
[00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.930] of
[00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.030] the
[00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.310] reasons
[00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.590] the
[00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.970] International
[00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.350] Phonetic
[00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.610] Alphabet
[00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.270] is
[00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.530] there.
[00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.790] It's
[00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.930] so
[00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.050] that
[00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.130] we
[00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.350] can
[00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.030] unambiguously
[00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.290] talk
[00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.470] about
[00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.610] what
[00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.710] we're
[00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.950] talking
[00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.190] about.
[00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.610] So
[00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.150] the
[00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.530] sound
[00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.650] at
[00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.750] the
[00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.970] beginning
[00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.190] of
[00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.610] thistle
[00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.890] and
[00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.030] the
[00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.290] sound
[00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.430] at
[00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.510] the
[00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.730] beginning
[00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.930] of
[00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.390] this,
[00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.270] they're
[00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.430] not
[00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.610] the
[00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.790] same
[00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.130] sound.
[00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.310] We'll
[00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.490] talk
[00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.650] about
[00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.770] the
[00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.010] difference
[00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.270] between
[00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.450] them
[00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.750] shortly,
[00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.670] but
[00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.890] at
[00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.050] this
[00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.250] point
[00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.870] maybe
[00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.050] it's
[00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.190] just
[00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.410] clear
[00:05:59.410 --> 00:05:59.610] they're
[00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.730] not
[00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.870] the
[00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.030] same
[00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.290] sound.
[00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.670] So
[00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.910] there
[00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.990] are
[00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.110] two
[00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.370] different
[00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.710] IPA
[00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.990] symbols
[00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.210] for
[00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.350] them.
[00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.750] The
[00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.910] Greek
[00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:03.150] letter
[00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.410] theta
[00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.710] is
[00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.950] used
[00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.110] for
[00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.230] the
[00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.410] sound
[00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.530] at
[00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.630] the
[00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.810] beginning
[00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.050] of
[00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.370] thistle,
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.540] and
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.080] that
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.380] second
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.600] letter
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.800] is
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.960] an
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.160] old
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.400] English
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.680] letter.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.340] It's
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.500] still
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.700] used
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.820] in
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.280] Icelandic.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.500] It's
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.780] sometimes
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.040] called
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.400] EV,
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.680] and
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.820] it
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.160] stands
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.340] for
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.500] the
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.760] sound
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.880] at
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.980] the
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.140] beginning
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.360] of
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.640] this.
[00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.470] Then
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.320] there
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.620] are
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.860] what
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.940] are
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.100] called
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.620] alveolar
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.080] sounds.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.240] If
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.600] you
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.520] put
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.740] your
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.200] tongue
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.560] at
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.060] the
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.340] top
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.480] of
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.620] your
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.000] mouth
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.560] and
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.840] kind
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.040] of
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.800] drag
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.980] it,
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.200] so
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.500] put
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.640] it
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.980] first
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.360] against
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.580] your
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.780] front
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.100] teeth,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.620] and
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.880] then
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.220] kind
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.440] of
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.840] drag

[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.340] backwards
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.060] along
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.520] the
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.720] top
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:38.860] of
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.980] your
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.320] mouth,
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.960] if
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.120] you're
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.360] like
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.720] me,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.080] you've
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.220] got
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.400] your
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.740] teeth
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.460] and
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.620] then
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.880] there's
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.060] this
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.240] kind
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.400] of
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.840] flat
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.140]-ish
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.800] space,
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.480] and
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.760] then
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.080] it
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.260] kind
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.340] of
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.500] goes
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.740] up.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.260] So
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.860] from
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.000] your
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.220] teeth
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.420] you
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.680] go
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.340] back,
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.800] there's
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.920] a
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.100] little
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.480] plateau
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.300] right
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.780] behind
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.940] your
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.120] teeth,
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.300] this
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.520] gum
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.800] ridge,
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.340] and
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.660] then
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:56.980] your
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.340] mouth
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.700] begins
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.900] to
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.180] go
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.420] up
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.580] high.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.880] That
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.140] ridge
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.300] is
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.500] called
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.640] the
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.000] alveolar
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.420] ridge,
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.540] and
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.380] if
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.500] you
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.680] put
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.840] your
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.020] tongue
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.300] there
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.560] then
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:05.780] you
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.180] are
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.480] all
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.680] set
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.840] to
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.020] make
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.420] sounds
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:07.660] like
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:07.820] the
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.020] sound
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.160] at
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.260] the
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.440] beginning
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.600] of
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.720] the
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.920] word
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.520] teeth,
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.220] or
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.740] duck,
[00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.890] or
[00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:13.570] nail,
[00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.470] and
[00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.670] for
[00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.970] sounds
[00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:15.230] like
[00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.850] sail
[00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:16.130] and
[00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.650] zoom,
[00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.050] again,
[00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.390] you're
[00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.570] not
[00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.830] actually
[00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.110] touching
[00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.370] that
[00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:18.850] position.
[00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.050] We'll
[00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.210] talk
[00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.390] more
[00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.610] about
[00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.030] the
[00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.270] difference
[00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.590] between
[00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.870] S
[00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.070] and
[00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.290] T
[00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.470] in
[00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:21.630] just
[00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:21.770] a
[00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.950] second,
[00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.410] but
[00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:22.550] they're
[00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.770] both
[00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.250] alveolar
[00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:23.730] sounds.
[00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.950] Your
[00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:24.170] tongue
[00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.430] is
[00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.930] pointing
[00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:25.110] in
[00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.210] the
[00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.410] general
[00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:25.770] direction
[00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.970] of
[00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.090] your
[00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.530] alveolar
[00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.890] ridge.
[00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.410] Everybody
[00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.610] have
[00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.810] that
[00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.230] sensation?
[00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:29.750] You
[00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.870] should
[00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.990] all
[00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.150] be
[00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.650] exploring
[00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.250] the
[00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:31.670] insides
[00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.850] of
[00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.990] your
[00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.190] own
[00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.550] heads
[00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.830] right
[00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.090] now.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.780] There's
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.020] a
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.440] type
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:42.560] of
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:42.760] sound
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.000] that
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.160] has
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.300] been
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:43.540] called
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.260] alveopalatal.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:44.540] It's
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.740] also
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.980] called
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.280] post
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.660]-alveolar.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.040] I'll
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.680] call
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:51.880] it
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:51.880] a
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.620] shh,
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:52.900] the
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.280] shh
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:53.440] at
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.520] the
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:53.700] beginning
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:53.900] of
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.160] ship.
[00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:55.210] If
[00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:55.270] you
[00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.410] go
[00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:55.590] back
[00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:55.730] and
[00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.890] forth
[00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.230] between
[00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.470] them,
[00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:01.750] you
[00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:01.930] make
[00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:02.010] a
[00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:02.190] very
[00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:02.430] soothing
[00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:02.870] sound,
[00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:04.810] and
[00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:05.050] maybe
[00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:05.230] what
[00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.350] you
[00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.490] can
[00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:05.750] feel
[00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:05.930] is
[00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:06.090] that
[00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:06.230] your
[00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.530] tongue
[00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:07.190] is
[00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.370] kind
[00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.470] of
[00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:07.750] rocking
[00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.030] back
[00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.190] and
[00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:08.450] forth.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:09.540] At
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:09.560] least
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:09.760] that's
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:09.860] what
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.020] my
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.160] tongue
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.320] is
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.540] doing.

[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.380] This
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:14.580] is
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.120] because

[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:45.740] called
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.100] velar
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.580] sounds.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.340] In
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:47.420] the
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:47.620] velar
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:47.960] sound,
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:48.680] the
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.360] body
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.580] of
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:49.720] your
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:49.980] tongue
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.260] is
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:50.480] up
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:50.840] against
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.240] what's
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.360] called
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.520] the
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:51.840] velum,
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.040] which
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.160] is
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.300] the
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:52.520] soft
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:52.760] tissue
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:52.920] at
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.020] the
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.160] back
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.280] of
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.380] your
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:53.680] mouth
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.120] that
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.560] we're
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.640] going
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:54.700] to
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:54.760] be
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:54.880] hearing
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.080] more
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.260] about

[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:55.480] a
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:55.680] second.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:55.940] It's
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.320] responsible
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:56.660] for
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.300] partitioning
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:57.600] your

[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:58.760] your
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.240] nose.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.580] So
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.940] that's
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.080] the
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.300] place
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:04.440] that
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:04.560] your
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:04.760] tongue
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:04.940] is
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.240] touching
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:05.920] when
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.080] you
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.340] say
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:06.580] the
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:06.840] sounds
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:06.980] at
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.080] the
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.320] beginnings
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.540] of
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:07.740] words
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.000] like
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.660] colonel
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:08.920] and
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.500] caught
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.300] and
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:10.920] gone,
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.580] and
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:12.780] when
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:12.900] you
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.080] make
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.400] the
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:13.800] nasal
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.100] sound
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:14.220] at
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:14.320] the
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:14.500] end
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:14.600] of
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:14.700] a
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:14.860] word
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.120] like
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.440] sing.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:16.620] So
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:16.700] if
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:16.780] you
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:16.920] think
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.060] about
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.200] where
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.320] your
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:17.480] tongue
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.700] is,
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:20.460] up
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:20.820] in
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:20.940] the
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.300] back.
[00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:22.250] Does
[00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.390] that
[00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:22.550] sound
[00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.730] right?
[00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.810] And
[00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.070] then
[00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.470] going
[00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.710] even
[00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:31.910] further
[00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:32.210] down,
[00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.510] further
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:34.920] down
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.100] in
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:35.240] your

[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.500] you've
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:36.720] got
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.040] the

[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.580] space
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:39.880] that's

[00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.150] end
[00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.270] of
[00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:09.370] a
[00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:09.470] word

[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.240] kind
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.340] of

[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.260] sound,
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:14.540] right?
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.360] Cha,
[00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:17.530] I
[00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:17.690] think
[00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:17.870] your
[00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:18.230] tongue
[00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:19.410] is
[00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.090] in
[00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.470] motion
[00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.810] as
[00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.930] you
[00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:21.050] are
[00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.330] making
[00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:21.630] that
[00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:21.990] sound.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:23.360] So
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.600] it
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.300] makes
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.340] one
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:26.680] sort
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:26.840] of,
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.020] it
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.460] completely
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:27.840] stops
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.020] the
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:28.200] flow
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.360] of
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:28.500] air,
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.320] and
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:29.460] then
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:29.620] it
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.080] gradually
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.520] peels
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:30.940] back
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.100] and
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.420] allows
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:31.660] the
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:31.840] air
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.020] to
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.200] flow
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:32.600] out.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:33.740] You
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:33.880] could
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.100] think
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:34.240] of
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:34.440] that
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:34.880] first
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.360] thing
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:35.580] it's
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:35.960] doing
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.640] as
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:36.900] I'm
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.240] on

[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.440] stop,
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.140] right?
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.360] So
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.300] it's
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:43.460] like

[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:43.940] T,
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.100] and
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.320] then
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.520] as
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:45.660] it
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:45.920] peels
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.360] back,
[00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:48.770] you
[00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:48.990] end
[00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.110] up
[00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.250] with
[00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.490] something

[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:29.920] your
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.240] tongue,
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:30.720] at
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:30.800] least
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.000] my
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.260] tongue,
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.460] touches
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:32.760] the
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.040] alveolar
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.340] ridge,
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:33.480] it
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:33.800] goes
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.260] where
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:34.420] I
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:34.580] said
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:34.700] it
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:34.920] would.
[00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:36.490] But
[00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:36.690] you're
[00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.130] right,
[00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:37.810] you
[00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:38.130] also
[00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:38.350] make
[00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:38.450] a
[00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:38.750] glottal
[00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.210] stop,
[00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:39.510] at
[00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:39.610] least
[00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:39.730] the
[00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:39.830] way
[00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:39.950] I
[00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:40.090] just
[00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:40.310] said
[00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.470] it,
[00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.730] put.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:44.660] You
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.720] could
[00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:47.550] contrast
[00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.850] that.
[00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:48.010] If
[00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:48.150] you
[00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.550] didn't
[00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.770] make
[00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:48.970] the
[00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:49.270] closure
[00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:49.470] at
[00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.570] the
[00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:49.930] alveolar
[00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:50.290] ridge,
[00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:50.970] it
[00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:51.090] would
[00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:51.330] sound
[00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:51.630] like
[00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:51.890] put,
[00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.710] put.
[00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.130] Not
[00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:55.430] an
[00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.630] English
[00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:55.890] word
[00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.070] for
[00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:56.230] me.
[00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:56.650] There
[00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:57.190] are
[00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:57.610] dialects
[00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:57.670] of
[00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.870] English
[00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:58.030] in
[00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.150] which
[00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.450] that's
[00:13:59.450 --> 00:13:59.790] something
[00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.970] you
[00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:00.090] would
[00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:00.310] say.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:03.920] There
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.280] are
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:04.800] places
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.100] in
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.440] English
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:05.920] where
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.520] things
[00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.090] that
[00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.230] we
[00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.670] write
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.840] as
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.140] other
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.420] kinds
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:10.580] of
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.020] sounds
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.660] actually
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:11.940] are,
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.040] in
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.200] fact,
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:12.460] glottal
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:12.740] stops,
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:12.880] at
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.000] least
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.120] in
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.300] my
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:13.600] English.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.080] So
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.200] the
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:14.460] difference
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:14.960] for
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.140] me
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:15.480] between
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.020] can
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:16.680] and
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.140] can't,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.000] my
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.260] wife,
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:20.380] who
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:20.480] is
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:20.820] Japanese,
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:21.260] is
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:21.500] driven
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:21.960] crazy
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.160] by
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.300] the
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:22.560] difference
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:22.900] between
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.260] can
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:23.460] and
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:23.920] can't,
[00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.390] because
[00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:24.910] they're
[00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.390] virtually
[00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:25.710] the
[00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.070] same,
[00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:26.770] right?
[00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.470] It's
[00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.670] very
[00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.870] hard
[00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.010] for
[00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:28.110] her
[00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.250] to
[00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:28.410] figure
[00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:28.670] out
[00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.990] often,
[00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:29.490] whether
[00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:29.750] I'm
[00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.970] saying
[00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:30.290] can
[00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.450] or
[00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:30.810] can't,
[00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:31.290] because
[00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:31.450] the
[00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:31.690] difference
[00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:31.930] between
[00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.070] them
[00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:32.190] is
[00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:32.450] really
[00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.170] mostly
[00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.710] just,
[00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:35.230] can't
[00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.530] is
[00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:35.750] really
[00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.990] just
[00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.510] can
[00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.150] plus
[00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.290] a
[00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:37.550] glottal
[00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.850] stop.
[00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:39.170] I'm
[00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:39.370] not
[00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:39.590] saying
[00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.050] can't,
[00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:40.670] usually,
[00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.210] unless
[00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.350] I'm
[00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.510] being
[00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:41.750] very
[00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.170] emphatic.
[00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.490] Good
[00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:44.810] question.
[00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:45.210] Yes,
[00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.850] yes,
[00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:55.450] yes,
[00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:55.670] there
[00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.750] are
[00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.930] things
[00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:56.110] like
[00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.330] that.
[00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.890] Do
[00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:56.950] you
[00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:57.050] have
[00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.270] something
[00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:57.490] in
[00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:57.670] mind?
[00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:58.590] Oh,
[00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:58.750] OK.
[00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.550] So
[00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.810] we
[00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.970] haven't
[00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:00.170] gotten
[00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.370] yet
[00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:00.530] to
[00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.770] R.
[00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:01.990] We'll
[00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.110] get
[00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.250] to
[00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:02.490] R
[00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:02.930] eventually.
[00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.510] But
[00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:03.790] actually,
[00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.130] people
[00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:04.530] discovered
[00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:05.110] at
[00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.230] a
[00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.390] certain
[00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:05.710] point,
[00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.310] so
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.700] people
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.260] investigate
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:08.480] this
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:08.620] kind
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:08.700] of
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:08.820] thing
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:08.940] in
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.060] all
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.240] kinds
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:09.380] of
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:09.580] ways.
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:09.840] One
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:09.940] is
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.040] the
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.160] kind
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.240] of
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:10.340] thing
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:10.540] we're
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:10.680] all
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:10.900] doing,
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.080] where
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.220] we
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:11.360] just
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:11.520] sort
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:11.600] of
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:11.780] sit
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:11.920] and
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.060] say,
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.200] what
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.320] is
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:12.480] my
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:12.640] mouth
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:12.900] doing?
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.320] There's
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:16.560] other
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:16.760] kinds
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:16.860] of
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.020] work
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:17.200] where
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.600] people
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.000] classically
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.060] paint
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.320] the
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:20.480] roof
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:20.620] of
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:20.780] your
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.120] mouth
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:21.620] with
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.400] stuff
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:22.580] that
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:22.700] will
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:22.880] come
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.200] off,
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:23.460] and
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:23.760] then
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.280] you
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:24.440] have
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:24.680] people
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.000] produce
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.140] a
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:25.420] sound,
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:25.680] and
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:25.820] then
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.000] you
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.480] stick
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:26.620] a
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:26.800] camera
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:26.960] in
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.080] their
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.320] mouth
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:27.480] and
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:27.620] take
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:27.920] pictures
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.200] and
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:28.500] see
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:28.720] which
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:28.960] parts
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.080] of
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.180] the
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:29.340] paint
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:29.580] came
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:29.840] off.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.060] You
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:32.440] stick
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:32.780] tubes
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:32.980] down
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.340] people's
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:33.540] nose
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:33.720] to
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:33.900] measure
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.260] airflow.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:34.560] You
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:34.720] do
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:34.880] all
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.080] kinds
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.420] of
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:35.780] horrible,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.180] invasive
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:36.600] things.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:37.740] These
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:37.920] days,
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.100] people
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:38.260] do
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:38.400] a
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:38.480] lot
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:38.580] of
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.140] MRIs.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.240] I'm
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:40.360] going
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:40.500] to
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:40.800] put
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.020] on
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:41.180] the
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:41.700] website
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.240] a
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.300] couple
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:45.480] of
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:45.800] websites
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.200] that
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.840] have
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.480] charts
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:47.700] of
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:47.880] all
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.040] of
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:48.200] the
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.480] sounds
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:48.660] that
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:48.760] we're
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:48.840] going
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:48.920] to
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.080] talk
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.300] about,
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:49.500] plus
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:49.700] many
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.060] more,
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.080] together
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:51.340] with
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:51.980] MRIs
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.060] of
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:52.180] the
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.220] insides
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:53.380] of
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:53.720] people's
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:53.980] mouths,
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.460] making
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:54.760] these
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.100] sounds
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.600] so
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:55.740] that
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:55.820] you
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:55.960] can
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.100] sort
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:56.180] of
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:56.360] see
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:56.580] the
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:56.920] anatomy
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.540] that's
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:57.820] involved.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:57.980] You
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:58.100] won't
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:58.260] just
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:58.400] have
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:58.500] to
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:58.640] think
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:58.800] about
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:58.940] it.
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:15:59.380] One
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:15:59.480] of
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:15:59.560] the
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:15:59.700] things
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:15:59.900] people
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.060] have
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:00.320] discovered
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:00.540] as
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:00.660] they're
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:00.820] doing
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:00.980] this
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.120] kind
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.200] of
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:01.360] work
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.860] is
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.020] that
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:02.260] people
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:02.600] just
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:02.880] have
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.280] different
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:03.620] ways
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:03.760] of
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.140] producing
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:04.520] R,
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:05.580] that
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:05.740] there
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.200] are
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:06.400] just
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:06.720] different
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.000] kinds
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.300] of
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:07.740] things
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:07.900] you
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.020] can
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.140] do
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:08.260] with
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:08.380] your
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:08.660] anatomy
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:08.940] to
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.100] make
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:09.220] an
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:09.400] R
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:09.760] sound.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:10.860] And
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.480] that's
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:11.740] probably
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.160] related
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:12.380] to
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:12.500] the
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:12.660] fact
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:12.840] that
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.160] R
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:13.820] is
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:13.960] one
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.060] of
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.160] the
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.380] kinds
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:14.520] of
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:14.720] sounds
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:14.880] that
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.060] people
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:15.500] classically
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:15.660] have
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:15.900] trouble
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.200] with.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:16.620] If
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:16.880] you've
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.000] been
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.320] around
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:17.780] small
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.160] children,
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:18.360] for
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:18.680] example,
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:18.960] it's
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.120] kind
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.260] of
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.020] standard
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.360] for
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:20.540] them
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:20.700] to
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:20.900] not
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.160] quite
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:21.360] get
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:21.640] R
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.180] right
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:22.420] and
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:22.980] to
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.200] say
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:23.440] something
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:23.620] that
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:23.840] sounds
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.020] more
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:24.200] like
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.300] a
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.600] W
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.280] at
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:25.440] a
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:25.900] certain
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.360] stage.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:27.380] So
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:27.860] I'm
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.040] sorry,
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.180] the
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:28.360] short
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:28.560] answer
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:28.700] to
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:28.820] your
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.040] question
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.240] is
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:29.540] yes,
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:29.960] and
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.200] R
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.420] might
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:30.560] be
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:30.660] an
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.000] example.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.060] Yeah?
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.540] Good
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:34.900] questions.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.100] Any
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.340] other
[00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.430] things
[00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.590] people
[00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.710] want
[00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.750] to
[00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:37.850] talk
[00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.990] about?
[00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.230] Okay.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:41.380] Okay,
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:42.020] so
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:42.780] I
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:43.620] went
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:43.780] through
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:43.980] that.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.260] Okay,
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:44.720] so
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.300] now
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:45.480] I
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:45.700] already
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:45.900] sort
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:45.980] of
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.200] alluded
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.380] to
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:46.580] the
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:46.740] fact
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.060] that,
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:47.520] you
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:47.720] know,
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.420] I
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:50.880] had
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.080] these
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:51.580] slides
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:51.800] that
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:51.960] had
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.420] various
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:52.840] places
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.000] of
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.500] articulation
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:53.760] on
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:53.920] them,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.100] but
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.240] of
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:54.480] course,
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.700] each
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.160] slide
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.340] had
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:56.660] multiple
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.160] sounds
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:57.420] on
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:57.600] it.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:58.300] And
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:58.560] so
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.260] places
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:16:59.420] of
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:16:59.820] articulation
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.020] is
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.320] obviously
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:00.560] not
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:00.700] the
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:00.820] whole
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.120] story.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:02.360] Here's
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:02.580] another
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:02.800] part
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:02.900] of
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.000] the
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.180] story.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:03.360] It's
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.060] what's
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:04.180] called
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:04.580] voicing.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.300] So
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.120] if
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.320] you
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:07.560] think
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:07.820] about
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.000] an
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.420] S
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:08.920] and
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.100] a
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.480] Z,
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.380] those
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:10.480] are
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:10.700] both
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.200] alveolar
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:11.640] sounds.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:11.960] Your
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.160] tongue
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.440] is
[00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:13.910] reaching
[00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.210] toward
[00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.350] the
[00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.710] alveolar
[00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:15.090] ridge,
[00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.050] but
[00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:17.190] they're
[00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:17.350] not
[00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.570] the
[00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:17.950] same.
[00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:19.150] What's
[00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.290] the
[00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:19.610] difference
[00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.950] between
[00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:20.190] them?
[00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:21.170] If
[00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:21.230] you
[00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.350] think
[00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.610] about,
[00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.790] if
[00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:21.850] you
[00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:21.930] go
[00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:22.070] back
[00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:22.210] and
[00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:22.350] forth
[00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:22.630] between
[00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.890] them,
[00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.190] you
[00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:28.590] can
[00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.230] feel
[00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.370] a
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:30.980] buzzing.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:33.520] And
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:33.680] if
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:33.820] you
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.000] put
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.140] your
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:34.520] hand
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:34.820] right
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.180] here,
[00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.930] you
[00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:37.090] put
[00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:37.210] your
[00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:37.450] hand
[00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:37.630] right
[00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.950] here,
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.120] right
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:40.300] here
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:40.460] on
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:40.900] your
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.120] throat,
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.160] then
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.400] when
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:42.520] you
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:42.720] make
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.000] the
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.620] sound,
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.300] you
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:45.480] can
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:45.720] sort
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:45.940] of
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.460] find
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:46.800] the
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.120] source
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:47.280] of
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:47.520] that
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.160] buzzing.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:48.400] It's
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:48.560] right
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:48.840] there
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.020] in
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.240] your
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.020] larynx.
[00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.410] What's
[00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:51.690] happening
[00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.110] when
[00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.230] you
[00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.410] make
[00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:52.590] a
[00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.930] Z
[00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:53.850] is
[00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:54.030] that
[00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.250] you're
[00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:54.710] holding
[00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:55.550] your
[00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.790] vocal
[00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.170] folds
[00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:57.790] across
[00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.010] the
[00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:58.250] flow
[00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.390] of
[00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.590] air
[00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.290] in
[00:17:59.290 --> 00:17:59.490] such
[00:17:59.490 --> 00:17:59.630] a
[00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.830] way
[00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.090] that
[00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:00.230] they
[00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.370] will
[00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:00.630] flap
[00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.750] in
[00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.870] the
[00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:01.210] breeze
[00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:01.770] as
[00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:01.970] the
[00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:02.170] air
[00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:02.410] goes
[00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:02.750] by.
[00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:03.070] They'll
[00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.510] vibrate.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:04.740] That's
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.140] like
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.620] whistling
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:06.880] with
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:06.960] a
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.160] blade
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:07.320] of
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:07.740] grass,
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.100] right?
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.220] Or
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.160] playing
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.320] a
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:09.480] reed
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:09.860] instrument,
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.100] right?
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:10.900] You're
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.360] getting
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.000] something
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.240] to
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.480] vibrate
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:12.700] really
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.020] fast.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.140] And
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:14.340] that's
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:14.460] what
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:14.760] you're
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.300] hearing.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:15.700] That's
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:15.880] that
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.120] buzzing
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.460] sound
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:16.640] that
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:16.680] you're
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.000] hearing
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.200] and
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.500] feeling
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:17.700] if
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:17.800] you
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:17.940] put
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.040] your
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.260] hand
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:18.420] right
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:18.580] here
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.640] when
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:19.800] you're
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.020] doing
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:20.220] a
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:20.420] Z.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:21.880] We
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.120] say
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.280] that
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:22.600] Z
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:22.940] is
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:23.360] voiced
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.040] and
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:24.180] that
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:24.440] S
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:24.700] is
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.220] voiceless.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:26.340] It's
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:26.540] a
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:26.940] distinction
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.180] in
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:27.460] voicing.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.240] Yes?
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.200] Yeah,
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:33.440] so
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:33.580] the
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:33.780] difference
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.000] between
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.400] cats
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:34.700] and
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.080] dogs.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:35.860] Yeah,
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.020] so
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:37.560] exactly.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.240] I
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.400] was
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:38.500] going
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:38.620] to
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:38.720] get
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:38.820] to
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:38.960] that
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.160] later,
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:39.340] but
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:39.560] yes,
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:39.820] that's
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:40.120] exactly
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:40.340] it.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:40.980] So
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.040] what's
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.180] the
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:42.400] difference
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:42.660] between
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:42.820] a
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.080] cat
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.240] and
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:43.360] a
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:43.740] dog?
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:44.340] Well,
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:44.480] as
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:44.640] far
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:44.760] as
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:44.860] a
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.260] phonologist
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:45.500] is
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:45.900] concerned,
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.360] the
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:46.660] difference
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:46.840] is
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.040] that
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.440] cat
[00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.610] and
[00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:49.050] dog
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.460] end
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:50.640] in
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:50.980] sounds
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.180] that
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:51.400] differ
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:51.640] in
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.000] voicing.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.440] Is
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:53.780] T
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.220] voiced
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:54.400] or
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:54.760] voiceless?
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:55.520] The
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:55.660] T
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:55.780] at
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:55.860] the
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:55.940] end
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:56.080] of
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.320] cat,
[00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.930] voiceless.
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.000] And
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.160] the
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:18:59.340] G
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:18:59.480] at
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:18:59.580] the
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:18:59.700] end
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:18:59.820] of
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.100] dog
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.320] is
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:00.680] voiced.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:01.740] And
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.160] you're
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.500] choosing
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:02.820] S
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.000] or
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.140] Z.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:03.360] You're
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:03.600] putting
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.020] the
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.300] sound
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:04.480] that
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:04.620] it
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.000] agrees
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.260] in
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:05.540] voicing
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:05.800] with
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:05.940] the
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.260] constant
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:06.640] that's
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:06.760] at
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:06.880] the
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.020] end.
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:07.260] That's
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:07.580] exactly
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:07.820] right.
[00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:15.310] Yeah,
[00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.530] so
[00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:15.730] this
[00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:15.810] is
[00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:15.910] a
[00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:16.030] really
[00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:16.190] good
[00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.630] question,
[00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.890] which
[00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:18.030] I
[00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.190] was
[00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.410] hoping
[00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:18.590] not
[00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.710] to
[00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.830] get
[00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:19.030] asked
[00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:19.170] quite
[00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:19.390] so
[00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:19.530] soon,
[00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:19.850] but
[00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.290] no,
[00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:20.550] that's
[00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:20.750] good.
[00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.630] Okay,
[00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:22.150] so
[00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.970] she
[00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:23.190] just
[00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.590] asked,
[00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.170] what
[00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:24.290] are
[00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:24.390] you
[00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.570] doing
[00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:24.730] when
[00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:24.870] you're
[00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:25.130] whispering?
[00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.470] So
[00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.550] if
[00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:26.630] you
[00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.770] think
[00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:26.930] about
[00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.070] what
[00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.190] you're
[00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.350] doing
[00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.510] when
[00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.630] you're
[00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.930] whispering,
[00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.570] first
[00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:28.710] of
[00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.910] all,
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:33.780] your
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.020] vocal
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:34.240] cords
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:34.360] are
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:34.580] not
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.000] vibrating
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.200] at
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:35.460] all
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:35.840] at
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.040] any
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.400] point.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:38.440] So
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:38.660] that
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.780] should
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.440] mean
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:40.740] that
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:40.980] you're
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.500] not
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.380] making
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:42.680] the
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.060] distinction
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:43.400] between
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:43.660] S
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:43.820] and
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.040] Z,
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:44.780] or
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.060] between
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:45.340] F
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:45.540] and
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:45.760] V,
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.360] or
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:46.560] what's
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:46.700] my
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:46.860] other
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.120] example
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:47.320] here,
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:47.540] F
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:47.820] and
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.120] V.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:48.880] So
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.020] the
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.240] difference
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:49.500] between
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:49.940] bath
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.440] and
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:50.880] bathe
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.860] is
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.060] that
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.260] the
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:52.600] V
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.060] is
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:53.400] voiced
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.620] and
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:53.840] the
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.000] F
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.560] is
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:54.940] voiceless.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.120] But
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.600] that
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:57.840] doesn't
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.040] seem
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:58.180] to
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:58.320] be
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:58.600] true,
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:58.980] right?
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:19:59.320] I
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:19:59.420] mean,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:19:59.520] if
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:19:59.700] you
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.120] whisper
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.240] safe
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.020] and
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.700] save,
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:07.780] you
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:07.900] have
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.040] the
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.320] feeling
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.200] that
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.520] you
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:09.640] can
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:09.760] hear
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:09.860] the
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.080] difference
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.320] between
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:10.760] them.
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:11.780] I
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.000] think
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.380] if
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:12.700] you
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:12.980] were
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.340] to
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:13.600] whisper
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:13.800] one
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:13.920] of
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.020] these,
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.160] so
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.320] do
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:14.440] a
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:14.680] controlled
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.120] experiment,
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:15.700] go
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.100] back
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:16.240] to
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:16.360] your
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:16.540] dorm,
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:16.900] whisper
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.100] to
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:17.240] your
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:17.440] dorm
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:17.600] mate,
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.020] safe,
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.480] and
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:18.660] then
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:18.920] find
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.100] out
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:19.300] what
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:19.440] they
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:19.620] think
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:19.760] you
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.020] said.
[00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:21.390] Maybe
[00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.730] warn
[00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:21.890] them
[00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:22.030] in
[00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:22.410] advance
[00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.510] what
[00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.730] you're
[00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:24.910] going
[00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:25.090] to
[00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.370] do.
[00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.410] I
[00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:27.790] really,
[00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:28.030] really,
[00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:28.790] boy,
[00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:29.210] the
[00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.570] complaints.
[00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:32.210] Yes,
[00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.510] so
[00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.770] there's
[00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:32.850] got
[00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:32.910] to
[00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:33.010] be
[00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:33.250] something
[00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:33.510] else
[00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.730] going
[00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:33.970] on,
[00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:34.150] right?
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.440] Let's
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:35.580] do
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:35.740] this
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.040] experiment
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:36.280] again,
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:36.420] though.
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:36.620] So
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.020] it's
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:37.240] easiest
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.420] for
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:37.560] you,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:37.800] actually,
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:37.960] with
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.180] F
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:38.320] and
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:38.480] V.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:38.780] So
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.120] let's
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.240] do
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:39.420] this
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:39.580] thing
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:39.820] again.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.100] If
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:40.200] we
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:40.300] go
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:40.460] back
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:40.580] and
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:40.740] forth
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:40.960] between
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.260] F
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:41.440] and
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:41.680] V,
[00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.890] which
[00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:46.010] of
[00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.130] them
[00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.270] is
[00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.610] voiced?
[00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.810] The
[00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:48.010] V,
[00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:48.310] right?
[00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.630] The
[00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.750] V
[00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.890] is
[00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:49.110] voiced.
[00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.810] OK,
[00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.330] now
[00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.470] do
[00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.590] it
[00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.830] again,
[00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:51.010] but
[00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:51.310] whisper.
[00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.890] Does
[00:20:58.890 --> 00:20:59.190] anybody
[00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.870] feel
[00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:00.030] a
[00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:00.310] difference
[00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.630] between
[00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.850] F
[00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:00.990] and
[00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.190] V?
[00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.850] I
[00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:03.910] mean,
[00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:04.130] not
[00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.450] here,
[00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:05.370] right?
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.220] Yeah?
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.320] Ah,
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.480] yeah,
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:20.620] there
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:20.740] might
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:20.840] be
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:20.940] a
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.120] difference
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.300] in
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:21.420] the
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:21.640] aperture
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:21.820] of
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:21.920] your
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.180] mouth.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:22.380] I
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:22.500] think
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:22.660] you're
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:22.860] right.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:23.480] And
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.180] I
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:24.340] think
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:24.520] you're
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:24.720] right,
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:24.960] too,
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:25.140] that
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:25.320] there's
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:25.420] a
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:25.680] difference
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:25.940] in
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.560] how
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:26.880] fast
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.080] the
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.240] air
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.540] is
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.240] flowing.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:28.960] For
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.100] me,
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:29.240] I
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:29.480] actually
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:29.740] have
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:29.900] the
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:30.100] opposite
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.300] of
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:30.380] your
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:30.640] feeling.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:30.820] For
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.060] me,
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.160] there's
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:34.320] more
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:34.540] air
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:34.680] when
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:34.860] there's
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.000] an
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.220] F
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.420] and
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:36.640] less
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:36.840] air
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.020] when
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.220] there's
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:37.340] a
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:37.500] V.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:38.060] Yeah?
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:47.860] Yeah,
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:48.700] my
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.000] jaw
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.220] is
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:49.560] moving
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:49.860] as
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:49.980] I
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.140] do
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:50.500] that,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:50.940] and
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.260] I
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:51.420] think
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:51.600] that
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:51.760] is
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.180] affecting
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:52.500] what
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:52.700] my
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:52.880] lips
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.040] are
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.300] doing.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:53.780] They're
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.180] coming
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:54.520] together
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:54.820] more.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:55.700] So
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:55.940] I
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:56.120] think
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:56.420] what's
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:56.740] happening
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:57.120] maybe
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.860] is
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.220] an
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:58.440] attempt
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:58.580] to
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:58.760] answer
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:58.940] your
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.260] question.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:00.140] So
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.700] I
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:01.940] just
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:02.360] said
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.300] sounds
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:03.480] can
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:03.620] be
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:03.800] either
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.080] voiced
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.260] or
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:04.640] voiceless.
[00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.930] If
[00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:06.090] they're
[00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:06.350] voiced,
[00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.510] what
[00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:06.610] it
[00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:06.810] means
[00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:06.910] is
[00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:07.050] that
[00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:07.170] your
[00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:07.410] vocal
[00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:07.710] cords
[00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.890] are
[00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:08.310] vibrating.
[00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.030] And
[00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:09.130] I
[00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:09.270] made
[00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.410] it
[00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:09.610] sound
[00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:09.950] like
[00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:10.290] the
[00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:10.390] way
[00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.470] you
[00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.610] do
[00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.850] that
[00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:11.070] is,
[00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.210] well,
[00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:11.370] you
[00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:11.710] stick
[00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.950] your
[00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:12.230] vocal
[00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.510] cords
[00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.750] into
[00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.930] the
[00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.110] flow
[00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.250] of
[00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.450] air,
[00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.850] right,
[00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.990] and
[00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.130] you
[00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:14.270] make
[00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.430] them
[00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.790] vibrate.
[00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.570] But
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:15.690] I
[00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:15.810] think
[00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:16.010] maybe
[00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.190] what
[00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.330] we're
[00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:16.590] learning
[00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.790] is
[00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:16.930] that
[00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:17.030] you
[00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:17.170] do
[00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:17.350] some
[00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.550] other
[00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:17.890] things,
[00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.270] too,
[00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.930] to
[00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:19.550] optimize
[00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:19.930] the
[00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:20.170] flow
[00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:20.370] of
[00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:20.590] air
[00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.830] so
[00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.990] that
[00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.110] you
[00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.250] will
[00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:21.410] get
[00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:21.510] a
[00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.630] good
[00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.050] vibration
[00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:22.450] going,
[00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:22.950] right?
[00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.210] That
[00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.570] maybe
[00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.090] if
[00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:24.270] the
[00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:24.450] flow
[00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:24.610] of
[00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:24.750] air
[00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.930] is
[00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:25.110] too
[00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.570] fast,
[00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:25.810] and
[00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:25.950] maybe
[00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:26.130] we're
[00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:26.370] learning
[00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:26.650] things
[00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:26.830] about
[00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.990] the
[00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.310] aperture
[00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.570] of
[00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:27.690] your
[00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:28.070] mouth,
[00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.470] right,
[00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.670] as
[00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:28.910] well.
[00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:30.530] There's
[00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:30.830] a
[00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:31.130] way
[00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.310] of
[00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.510] making
[00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.890] sure
[00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:32.130] that
[00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:32.390] the
[00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.930] pressure
[00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.210] that
[00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:33.350] you're
[00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.670] getting,
[00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:34.190] the
[00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.390] sort
[00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.510] of
[00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.790] rush
[00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:34.930] of
[00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:35.070] air
[00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.270] that
[00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.390] you're
[00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.570] getting
[00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.690] on
[00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:35.790] your
[00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:36.010] vocal
[00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:36.230] cords,
[00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:36.370] will
[00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:36.550] make
[00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:36.690] them
[00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:36.990] vibrate
[00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.170] in
[00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:37.310] just
[00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.430] the
[00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.590] right
[00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.830] way.
[00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.770] And
[00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:39.210] you're
[00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:39.610] manipulating
[00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:39.970] all
[00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:40.090] of
[00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:40.310] that
[00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.710] stuff
[00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.050] without
[00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:41.610] thinking
[00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:41.890] about
[00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:42.130] it.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:42.740] And
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.260] you
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:43.660] can
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:43.860] still
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.060] hear
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:44.180] it
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:44.340] when
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:44.480] you
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:44.720] whisper.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.020] So
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.140] when
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:45.260] you
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:45.520] whisper,
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:45.880] you're
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.220] not
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:46.620] engaging
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:46.820] your
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.040] vocal
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.340] cords,
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:47.500] but
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:47.620] you're
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:47.820] doing
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:47.960] all
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.100] the
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:48.300] other
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:48.680] stuff.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.040] And
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.380] that's
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:49.480] what
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:49.620] you're
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:49.860] using
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.020] to
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:50.120] hear
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:50.260] the
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:50.560] difference.
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:52.240] There's
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:52.940] experimental
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.240] work
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:53.380] on
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:53.580] this.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:53.700] It's
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:53.800] the
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:53.900] kind
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.000] of
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.120] thing
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:54.380] people
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:54.700] try
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:54.820] to
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:54.980] figure
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.280] out.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.000] Really
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.160] good
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:57.480] question.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:00.660] Okay,
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.100] so
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:01.400] your
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:01.620] vocal
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:01.860] cords
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:02.040] can
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.160] either
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.320] be
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:02.660] vibrating
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:02.840] or
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:02.940] they
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:03.100] cannot
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.320] be
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:03.640] vibrating.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:04.040] So
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:04.940] you
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.820] have
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.100] voiced
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:06.480] sounds
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:06.560] and
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:06.640] you
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:06.780] have
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.060] voiceless
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.500] sounds.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:07.720] So
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.040] S
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.280] and
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:08.580] Z
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:08.860] and
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.120] T
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:09.360] and
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:09.580] D
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:09.860] are
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.180] all
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:10.600] alveolar,
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.160] but
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:11.500] S
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:11.700] and
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:11.940] T
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:12.200] are
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:12.580] voiceless
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.180] and
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:13.480] Z
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:13.720] and
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:13.920] D
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.100] are
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.460] voiced.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:15.480] Does
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:15.560] that
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:15.700] all
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:15.900] sound
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.200] right?
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:16.600] Is
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:16.820] anyone
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.540] upset
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:17.820] by
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.020] any
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.160] of
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.460] that?
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.760] Disturbed?
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.320] Alarmed?
[00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.670] Hungry?
[00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:23.110] Yeah?
[00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:23.550] Anything?
[00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.810] Okay,
[00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.030] good.
[00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:25.250] So
[00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:26.430] back
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.000] to
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.120] the
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.340] Polish
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:31.760] plurals.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:32.780] So
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.500] we
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:33.760] saw
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.300] before
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.700] we
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.060] convinced
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:36.580] ourselves,
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:36.840] or
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:36.980] I
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.320] convinced
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:37.800] myself,
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.020] and
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.220] I
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.660] tried
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:38.880] to
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.020] take
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.140] the
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:39.300] rest
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:39.400] of
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:39.480] you
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:39.660] with
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:39.820] me,
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.020] kind
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:40.100] of
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:40.200] as
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.540] collateral
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:40.920] damage,
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:41.600] that
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.700] Polish
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.740] has
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.800] words
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.000] that
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.220] end
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:45.380] in
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:45.560] K
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:45.800] and
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.040] words
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.200] that
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:46.420] end
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:46.620] in
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:46.940] G
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.020] underlyingly,
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.440] but
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:48.560] it
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:48.800] also
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.020] has
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.180] a
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:49.380] rule
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:49.600] that
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:49.980] changes
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.340] G
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:50.540] to
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:50.800] K
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.000] at
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.120] the
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:51.360] ends
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:51.500] of
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:51.840] words.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.060] That
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:52.220] was
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:52.580] Polish.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.420] Okay,
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:55.600] but
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:55.700] it's
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:55.840] not
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.020] just
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.220] G.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.080] So
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:58.920] we
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.040] can
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.220] see
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:23:59.380] some
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:23:59.540] other
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:23:59.760] pairs
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:23:59.940] of
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.140] words.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:00.280] I
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.400] don't
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:00.520] have
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:00.660] any
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:00.820] more
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.120] minimal
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:01.480] pairs
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:01.760] for
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:01.920] you,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.100] but
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:02.240] you
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:02.360] can
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:02.500] see
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:02.720] there's
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:02.840] the
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.000] same
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.320] general
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:03.780] tendency
[00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.090] that
[00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.750] if
[00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.870] we
[00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:06.150] look
[00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:06.450] at
[00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:06.950] singulars
[00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:07.430] in
[00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.810] Polish,
[00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:08.390] that
[00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.530] they
[00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:08.710] can
[00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.990] end
[00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.170] in
[00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:09.470] sounds
[00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.730] like
[00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:10.090] K
[00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:10.410] or
[00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:10.830] P

[00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:12.350] S,
[00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:12.990] right?
[00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:13.230] That's
[00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.370] what
[00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.490] we're
[00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.770] seeing
[00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:13.950] in
[00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:14.130] these
[00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:14.490] pairs.
[00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:15.370] And
[00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:15.550] that
[00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:15.810] when
[00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:16.010] you
[00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.670] pluralize
[00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:16.930] them,
[00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:18.870] some
[00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:19.290] nouns
[00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:19.550] that
[00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:19.770] end
[00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:19.970] in
[00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:20.210] P
[00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.630] still
[00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.910] end
[00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:21.130] in
[00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:21.330] P
[00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:21.670] when
[00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:21.810] you
[00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:22.130] add
[00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.550] the
[00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.130] E,
[00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.430] the
[00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.930] suffix,
[00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.450] like
[00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:24.850] corpse,
[00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.090] but
[00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.470] some
[00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.930] change
[00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:27.110] the
[00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.310] P
[00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:27.550] to
[00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:27.710] a
[00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.890] B.
[00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.050] And
[00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:29.290] the
[00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:29.490] same
[00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:29.750] deal
[00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.930] for
[00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:30.130] these
[00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:30.270] other
[00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:30.670] ones.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:31.760] So
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:31.920] what
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.060] we're
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:32.340] learning
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:32.700] is
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.920] it
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.360] isn't
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:34.880] just
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.280] that
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:35.700] G
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.200] becomes
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:36.600] K
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:36.840] at
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.000] the
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.160] end
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:37.280] of
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:37.420] a
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:37.700] word
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:37.960] in
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.160] Polish.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:39.720] There's
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:39.900] this
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.100] more
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:40.400] general
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:40.840] thing.
[00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:42.070] What's
[00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.190] the
[00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.330] more
[00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:42.570] general
[00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:43.030] thing?
[00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:43.350] What's
[00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.530] going
[00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:43.770] on
[00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:43.970] here?
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:45.500] What's
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:45.640] the
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:45.920] difference
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.260] between
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:46.520] G
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:46.720] and
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.000] K?
[00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.950] So
[00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:48.070] they're
[00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.270] both
[00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:48.650] velar.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:52.880] Yeah,
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.120] which
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.280] one
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:53.420] is
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:53.740] voiced?
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:55.500] The
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:55.780] G.
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:56.840] So
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.260] what's
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:57.540] happening
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:57.800] is

[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.200] voiced,
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:24:59.400] is
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:24:59.740] becoming
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.100] voiceless
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.380] at

[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.240] in
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:01.460] Polish.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.720] What's
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.000] happening

[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:11.300] B
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:11.600] becomes
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:11.760] the
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:11.980] voiceless
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:12.380] version,
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:12.560] which
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:12.700] is
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:12.940] P.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:13.200] Yeah,
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:13.620] those
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:13.740] are
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.080] both
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:14.820] bilabial
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.380] sounds.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:15.740] They
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:15.880] involve
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.060] both
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:16.220] your
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:16.440] lips.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.160] Yes?
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:18.740] How
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.600] is
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:21.920] D
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.460] voiced?
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:23.980] Oh,
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.260] B.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.160] B.
[00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:30.330] You're
[00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:30.550] raising
[00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:30.690] a
[00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:30.810] good
[00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:31.030] point.
[00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:31.530] There's
[00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:31.690] a
[00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:31.950] reason
[00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.170] that
[00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:32.290] I
[00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:32.630] started
[00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.930] with
[00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:33.230] sounds
[00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.450] like
[00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:33.810] S
[00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:34.050] and
[00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:34.330] Z
[00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:34.710] and
[00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.950] F
[00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.150] and
[00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:35.410] V,
[00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:35.930] because
[00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:36.170] you
[00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:36.610] can
[00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:37.270] go
[00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.450] for
[00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:39.850] as
[00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:40.030] long
[00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:40.170] as
[00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:40.250] you
[00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.430] have
[00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.750] breath.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:42.620] Whereas
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.600] there's
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:44.700] a
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:44.860] limit
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:45.040] to
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:45.200] how
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.380] long
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:45.520] you
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:45.720] can
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:45.940] be.
[00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:49.290] We
[00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:49.510] just
[00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.950] said
[00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.310] the
[00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.470] way
[00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.790] voicing
[00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:51.310] works
[00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.910] is
[00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:52.050] that
[00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:52.250] you've
[00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.390] got
[00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.710] air
[00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:53.250] flowing
[00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:53.970] across
[00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:54.190] your
[00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.410] vocal
[00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:54.730] folds
[00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:54.910] and
[00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:55.150] making
[00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:55.390] them
[00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:55.870] vibrate.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:56.940] And
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.120] for
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.340] a
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:57.540] Z,
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:57.840] you
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:57.980] can
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.160] see
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:58.300] how
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:58.460] that
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:58.600] would
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:58.960] work,
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:25:59.120] you
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:25:59.280] know,
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:25:59.420] so
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:25:59.600] the
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:25:59.760] air
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:25:59.940] just
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.280] flows.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:00.880] For
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.100] a
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.420] B,
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:02.400] well,
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.720] the
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:03.860] air
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.120] only
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:04.520] has
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:04.700] so
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:04.880] far
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.020] to
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.300] go.
[00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:06.290] Yeah,
[00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.850] that's
[00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:06.970] one
[00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:07.250] reason
[00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.450] you
[00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:07.710] can't
[00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.890] keep
[00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:08.030] a
[00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:08.250] B
[00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:08.590] going
[00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.790] for
[00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:09.030] very
[00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.350] long.
[00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.810] All
[00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:09.990] that
[00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.210] air
[00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:10.510] has
[00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.610] to
[00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.730] get
[00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:10.890] in.
[00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:11.430] It
[00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.610] has
[00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:11.730] to
[00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:11.890] flow
[00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:12.390] past
[00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.530] your
[00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:12.750] vocal
[00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.950] folds
[00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:13.130] to
[00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.270] get
[00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:13.470] them
[00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:13.610] to
[00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.890] vibrate
[00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:13.990] a
[00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.090] little
[00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.310] bit,
[00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.730] and
[00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:14.850] then
[00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:14.950] it
[00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:15.070] gets
[00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.150] to
[00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:15.250] your
[00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:15.390] mouth,
[00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.530] and
[00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:15.650] then
[00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:15.730] it
[00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:15.890] has
[00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:16.010] to
[00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.370] stop.
[00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.810] So,
[00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:17.030] you
[00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.150] know,
[00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.850] there
[00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:17.950] are
[00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:18.110] other
[00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.510] departments
[00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.710] that
[00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.790] are
[00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:19.010] better
[00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.190] at
[00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.330] this
[00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:19.470] than
[00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.610] I
[00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:19.770] am,
[00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:19.990] but,
[00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:20.170] you
[00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:20.290] know,
[00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.550] the
[00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:20.910] air
[00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:21.210] pressure
[00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:21.390] in
[00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:21.510] your
[00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.710] mouth
[00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.930] is
[00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:22.110] going
[00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.250] to
[00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.390] build
[00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.570] up
[00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:22.850] past
[00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.970] a
[00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:23.110] certain
[00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.370] point.
[00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:23.650] You
[00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:23.850] won't
[00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:23.990] be
[00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.110] able
[00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.230] to
[00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.330] keep
[00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:24.530] doing
[00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:24.730] that.
[00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.470] But
[00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.830] you
[00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.970] do
[00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:27.090] it
[00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:27.210] for
[00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.310] as
[00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.450] long
[00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:27.570] as
[00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:27.670] you
[00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:27.930] can.
[00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:28.290] That's
[00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:28.390] the
[00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.570] sense
[00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:28.690] in
[00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:28.830] which
[00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:29.030] it's
[00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:29.270] voiced.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:30.540] Yeah,
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:30.860] good
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.160] question.
[00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:32.370] Yeah.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.400] So,
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:35.660] yeah,
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.120] what's
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.360] happening
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:36.560] in
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:36.780] Polish
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.020] is
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.280] not
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:37.640] just
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:37.840] G
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.120] becomes
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.380] K.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.500] It's
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.420] voiced
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:40.960] sounds
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.220] are
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:41.580] becoming
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.120] voiceless.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.480] So,
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:44.320] Z
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:44.700] becomes
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.100] S,
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:45.740] D
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.140] becomes
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:46.520] T,
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:46.900] B
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.260] becomes
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:47.520] P,
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:47.720] and
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:47.820] G
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.140] becomes
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:48.420] K.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.240] So,
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:49.600] it's
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.060] sometimes
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:50.420] called
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:50.800] final
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.340] devoicing,
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:51.720] and
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:51.940] it's
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.320] cross
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:52.740]-linguistically
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.040] quite
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:53.380] common.
[00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.570] Okay.
[00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:59.270] So,
[00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.070] we've
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:04.740] talked
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.160] about
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:05.600] place
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:05.740] of
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:06.340] articulation,
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.280] and
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:07.460] we've
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:07.660] talked
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:07.920] about
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.300] voicing.
[00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.410] Now,
[00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.530] we
[00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:09.850] need
[00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:09.950] to
[00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:10.110] talk
[00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.270] about
[00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:10.630] another
[00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:11.070] sort
[00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.230] of
[00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.650] dimension
[00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:12.010] for
[00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:12.690] categorizing
[00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.570] sounds,
[00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.110] which
[00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.250] is
[00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:14.450] called
[00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.770] manner
[00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:15.010] of
[00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:15.630] articulation.
[00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.250] So,
[00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.470] think
[00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.690] about
[00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:17.090] S
[00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:17.450] and
[00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.850] T.
[00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:18.530] They're
[00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:18.930] both
[00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:19.390] alveolar,
[00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:19.950] and
[00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:20.110] they're
[00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.350] both
[00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.750] voiceless,
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.360] but
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:22.540] they're
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:22.760] different
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:22.980] from
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.160] each
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:23.400] other,
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:24.600] and
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:24.700] the
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:24.820] way
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:24.980] we
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:25.300] distinguish
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:25.580] them
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.060] is
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:26.500] via
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:26.700] what
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:26.840] we
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.000] call
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.340] manner
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:27.560] of
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.180] articulation.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:28.800] So,
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.000] they're
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.380] both
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:29.880] voiceless
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.500] alveolar
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.120] sounds,
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:31.820] but
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.580] T
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.080] is
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:33.300] a
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:33.820] stop,
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:34.740] and
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.360] S
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:35.640] is
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:35.900] what's
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:36.100] called
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:36.280] a
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:36.640] fricative.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:37.800] So,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:38.780] stops
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:38.960] are
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.180] also
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:39.460] called
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.020] plosives.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.460] I
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:41.900] promise
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.480] never,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:42.740] ever
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.000] to
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.240] call
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:43.440] them
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:43.960] plosives.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:44.720] I
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:44.900] will
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.220] always
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:45.480] call
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.680] them
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.220] stops,
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:46.560] because
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:46.840] that's
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.000] what
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.160] I
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:47.320] grew
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:47.440] up
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:47.660] calling
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:47.900] them,
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:48.240] but
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:48.360] you
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:48.520] will
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:48.860] sometimes
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:49.080] see
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.380] things
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:49.600] written
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:49.820] in
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:49.920] which
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.120] they're
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:50.320] called
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:50.840] plosives.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.060] In
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:52.620] homeworks,
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:52.720] if
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:52.800] you
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:52.960] ever
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.120] need
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:53.280] to
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:53.420] write
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:53.640] about
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:53.840] them,
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.200] feel
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:54.360] free
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:54.520] to
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:54.640] call
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:54.800] them
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:54.960] either
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.280] one.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:55.580] It
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:55.780] doesn't
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:56.040] matter.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:57.380] I
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:57.580] like
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:57.780] calling
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:57.980] them
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:58.320] stops,
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:58.780] because
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.240] they're
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:27:59.480] named
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:27:59.740] after
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:27:59.920] the
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.200] fact
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:00.480] that,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:00.660] well,
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:00.900] they
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.600] stop
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:01.820] the
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.080] flow
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:02.240] of
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:02.420] air,
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:02.740] right?
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:02.980] That's
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.120] what
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.260] they
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:03.440] do.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:03.720] That's
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:03.820] what
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:03.920] a
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.180] stop
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:04.440] is.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:04.900] So,
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:05.060] the
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:05.240] air
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.360] is
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:05.540] coming
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:05.680] out
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:05.740] of
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:05.860] your
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:06.100] lungs,
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:06.260] and
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:06.340] it
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:06.560] gets
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:06.960] stopped.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:09.600] Fricatives,
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.100] like
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:10.400] S,
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.100] are
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:11.540] sounds
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:11.860] in
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:12.060] which
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.220] you
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:12.480] don't
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:12.740] stop
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:12.900] the
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.080] flow
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.260] of
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:13.340] air,
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:13.840] but
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.080] you
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.640] narrow
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.240] some
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:16.720] aperture
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.820] enough
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.080] to
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:18.460] create
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:18.940] turbulent
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.380] airflow,
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:20.080] which
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:20.220] you
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:20.580] hear
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:20.900] as
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.140] a
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:21.660] kind
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:21.760] of
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.080] hissing
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.420] sound.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.000] So,
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:23.280] sounds
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:23.500] like
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:23.780] S,
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:24.340] and
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:24.740] shh,
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.060] and
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:25.520] ff,
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.140] these
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:26.720] are
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:26.880] all
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.180] fricatives.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:34.600] So,
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:34.780] for
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.020] T
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:35.240] and
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.440] D,
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:35.940] the
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.160] airflow
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.440] is
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:36.820] stopped.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:37.440] For
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:37.780] S
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.040] and
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:38.340] Z,
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.000] the
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.240] airflow
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.600] is
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:39.980] restricted,
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:40.260] but
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:40.400] is
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:40.600] not
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.040] stopped.
[00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:43.170] Hold
[00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:43.390] your
[00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:43.610] tongue
[00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:44.030] close
[00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:44.210] to
[00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:44.330] the
[00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.610] alveolar
[00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:44.950] ridge,
[00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:45.170] but
[00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:45.430] you
[00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:46.170] allow
[00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:46.410] air
[00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:46.570] to
[00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:46.710] keep
[00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.970] flowing
[00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:47.250] through.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.140] That's
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.540] why,
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:50.040] since
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.180] the
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:50.540] conversation
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:50.740] we
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:50.940] just
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:51.120] had,
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:51.420] that's
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:51.760] why
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.480] an
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:52.840] S,
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:53.300] you
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:53.420] can
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:53.620] keep
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:53.980] going
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.220] for
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:54.420] as
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:54.580] long
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:54.700] as
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:54.780] you
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:54.920] have
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.140] breath
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:55.260] in
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:55.400] your
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:55.660] lungs,
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:56.400] whereas
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:56.700] a
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:56.960] T,
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:57.820] you
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.100] can't
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:58.300] keep
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:58.720] executing
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:58.980] it.
[00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.990] So,
[00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.690] now
[00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.790] we
[00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:06.130] have
[00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:06.670] these
[00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:06.910] three
[00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:07.250] ways
[00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.390] of
[00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:08.050] categorizing
[00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:08.330] these
[00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:08.910] kinds
[00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:09.090] of
[00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:09.330] speech
[00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:09.730] sounds,
[00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:11.150] place,
[00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:11.550] and
[00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:11.850] manner,
[00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:12.350] and
[00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.750] voicing.
[00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:13.610] Place
[00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.730] of
[00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:14.290] articulation,
[00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.630] manner
[00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.790] of
[00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:15.330] articulation,
[00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:15.590] and
[00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.930] voicing.
[00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:17.330] So,
[00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:17.630] there
[00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.710] are
[00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:17.810] a
[00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.930] bunch
[00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:18.090] of
[00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:18.410] places
[00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:18.590] of
[00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.190] articulation
[00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.530] over
[00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:19.710] there
[00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.810] on
[00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:19.950] the
[00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:20.250] left,
[00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:22.190] and
[00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.750] the
[00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.150] sounds
[00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:23.330] that
[00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.410] we
[00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:23.530] have
[00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:23.750] mainly
[00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.050] talked
[00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:24.250] about
[00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:24.410] have
[00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:24.550] been
[00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:24.750] either
[00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.110] stops
[00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.270] or
[00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:25.670] fricatives.
[00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:26.670] And
[00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.070] then,
[00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.570] each
[00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:30.350] of
[00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.570] these
[00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.030] places
[00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.250] on
[00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.370] the
[00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.630] table,
[00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.210] there's
[00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.350] a
[00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.610] pair
[00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:32.850] of
[00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.350] sounds,
[00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.990] and
[00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.150] I
[00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:35.590] hope
[00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.790] I
[00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:36.230] managed
[00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.490] to
[00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:36.630] do
[00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.810] this
[00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:37.010] right.
[00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:37.270] Yes,
[00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:37.410] it
[00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:37.550] looks
[00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:37.730] like
[00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.870] I
[00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:38.110] did.
[00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:39.310] In
[00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.490] all
[00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:39.630] of
[00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.830] these
[00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.310] pairs,
[00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.010] you've
[00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:42.170] got
[00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:42.390] both
[00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:42.510] a
[00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:42.730] voiced
[00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:42.910] and
[00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:43.010] a
[00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.270] voiceless
[00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:43.770] sound.
[00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:44.010] Which
[00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:44.190] one
[00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.330] is
[00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.770] first?
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:46.980] The
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:47.200] voiced
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.540] sound.
[00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.290] So,
[00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:48.630] in
[00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.850] all
[00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:48.970] of
[00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:49.130] those,
[00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.350] there's
[00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.450] a
[00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:49.650] pair.
[00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:50.790] So,
[00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:51.010] you've
[00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.170] got
[00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:51.530] shh
[00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:51.730] and
[00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.110] shh,
[00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.370] for
[00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.630] example,
[00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:52.930] the
[00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:53.170] post
[00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:53.490]-alveolar
[00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:53.850] fricatives,
[00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.510] and
[00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:54.730] the
[00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:55.070] shh
[00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.270] is
[00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:55.450] the
[00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:55.690] voiced
[00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:55.930] one,
[00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.110] and
[00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.250] the
[00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:56.530] shh
[00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:56.730] is
[00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:56.870] the
[00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:57.090] voiceless
[00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:57.390] one.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:58.260] Yeah?
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:03.840] All
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:03.980] right.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:04.340] So,
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:04.700] now,
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.060] new
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.820] class
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:05.960] of
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:06.240] sounds.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:06.460] This
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:06.560] is
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:06.660] a
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:06.780] new
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:06.980] manner
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.120] of
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.640] articulation.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:08.560] So,
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:08.680] we've
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:08.860] got
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.220] D,
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:09.700] which
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:09.800] is
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:09.900] a
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.100] voiced
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:10.460] alveolar
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:10.860] stop,
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:11.540] and
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:11.920] Z,
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:12.580] which
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:12.700] is
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:12.860] a
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:13.100] voiced
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:13.520] alveolar
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:13.900] fricative,
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:14.500] and
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:14.620] now
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:14.720] we
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:14.860] need
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:14.960] to
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.100] think
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.320] about
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:15.540] N.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.300] Well,
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:18.300] N
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.140] is
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.600] voiced,
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.080] and
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.780] it's
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.040] a
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:24.560] stop
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:24.760] in
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:24.920] the
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.160] sense
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:25.360] that
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:25.520] you
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:25.680] are
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.140] stopping
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:26.460] the
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:26.720] air
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.040] from
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:27.400] flowing
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:27.740] through
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:27.940] your
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.320] mouth.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:28.840] If
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:28.920] you
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.060] think
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:29.240] about
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:29.460] what's
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:29.720] happening
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.160] inside
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:30.380] your
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:30.720] mouth
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.040] during
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.200] an
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.400] N,
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.360] your
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:32.700] tongue
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:32.940] is
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.300] jammed
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:33.540] against
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:33.740] your
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:34.080] alveolar
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.420] ridge,
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.680] just
[00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.910] as
[00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:36.010] it
[00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:36.130] would
[00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:36.290] be
[00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:36.470] for
[00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.610] a
[00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:36.770] T.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:38.780] So,
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:41.900] I
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:42.100] love
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:42.280] the
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:42.500] sound
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:42.640] of
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.000] phonetics
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.240] in
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:43.320] the
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:43.500] morning.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:43.740] It's
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:43.960] great.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.340] So,
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:47.780] when
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:47.900] you're
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.100] doing
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.280] an
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:48.700] N,
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:49.560] you've
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:49.800] stopped
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:49.960] the
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.120] flow
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:50.260] of
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:50.320] air
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:50.440] in
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:50.540] your
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:50.780] mouth,
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:50.920] and
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.060] so
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:51.360] N
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:51.720] is
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.200] technically
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.480] a
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:52.820] stop.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:53.360] It's
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:53.560] called
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:53.720] a

[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.180] because
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:54.420] there's
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:54.560] no

[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:55.500] mouth.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:55.880] If
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.040] there's
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:56.160] air

[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:56.900] somewhere,
[00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.730] it's

[00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:58.010] out
[00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.070] of

[00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.530] nose,
[00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:00.330] and
[00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:00.910] you
[00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:01.030] can
[00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:01.310] tell
[00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:02.150] because
[00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:02.410] if
[00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:02.510] you
[00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.710] hold
[00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.870] your

[00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:04.430] you
[00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.570] will
[00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:04.710] not
[00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.830] be

[00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:05.050] to
[00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:05.210] make

[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:07.940] The

[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:08.580] that
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.180] you
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:09.680] can
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:09.860] keep

[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:11.300] long
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:11.420] as
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:11.480] you
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:11.620] have
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:11.880] breath,
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:12.680] is,
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:13.680] well,
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.060] the
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:14.220] air
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:14.440] has
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:14.620] some

[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:14.940] to
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.180] go.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:15.480] It's
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:15.640] going
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:15.820] out
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:15.940] your
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.220] nose.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:18.460] What's
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:18.760] happening
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.000] when
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:19.100] you
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:19.280] make
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:19.420] an
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:19.680] N
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.260] is
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:20.460] that
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:20.600] you
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:20.780] are
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.400] lowering
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.100] the
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:22.440] velum,
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.340] which
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:24.560] is
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:24.980] this
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.520] doohickey
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:25.660] in
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:25.780] the
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:25.920] back
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.060] of
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:26.160] your
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.540] mouth
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.120] that
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:27.700] partitions
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:28.260] your
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:28.720] nose
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.140] from
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:29.520] your
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.020] mouth.
[00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:31.150] By
[00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:31.510] lowering
[00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:31.790] it,
[00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:32.010] you're
[00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:32.350] allowing
[00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.610] air
[00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:32.790] to
[00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.010] flow
[00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:33.250] through
[00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:33.470] your
[00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.850] nose.
[00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.350] So,
[00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.570] for
[00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:34.870] T
[00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:35.130] and
[00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:35.450] D,
[00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:36.250] the
[00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:36.510] airflow
[00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:36.710] is
[00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.930] stopped
[00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:37.090] at

[00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.510] alveolar
[00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:37.870] ridge.
[00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:38.450] For
[00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.850] N,
[00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.530] the
[00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:39.830] airflow
[00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.190] is
[00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.470] also
[00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.810] stopped
[00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:40.950] at
[00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:41.070] the
[00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.330] alveolar
[00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.710] ridge.
[00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:41.930] It
[00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:42.290] can't
[00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:42.450] go
[00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:42.590] through
[00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.730] the
[00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:42.990] mouth.
[00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:43.450] It's
[00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:43.670] stopped
[00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:43.850] right
[00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:44.030] there,
[00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:44.450] but
[00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.670] it
[00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:44.870] goes
[00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:45.050] through
[00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:45.210] your
[00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:45.410] nose.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:47.640] A
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.020] nasal
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:48.620] stop,
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:49.680] a

[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:51.540] people
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:51.860] often
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.080] just
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:52.300] call
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:52.480] them
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:52.960] nasals
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.360] because
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:54.740] nasal
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.140] fricatives
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:55.380] are
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:55.680] messy.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.380] N
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:06.940] is
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.080] an

[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.000] nasal.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:09.360] What
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:09.480] would
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:09.600] a
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.100] bilabial
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:10.440] nasal
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:10.720] sound
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.020] like?
[00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.790] Close
[00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:16.390] your
[00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:16.570] lips
[00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:16.730] and
[00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.930] allow
[00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:17.070] the
[00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.170] air
[00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:17.290] to
[00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:17.430] flow
[00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.610] through
[00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:17.750] your
[00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.970] nose.
[00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:18.810] A
[00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:19.130] velar
[00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.450] nasal,
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.440] remember
[00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.830] that
[00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:25.590] velar
[00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.930] means
[00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:26.210] the
[00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.430] place
[00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.530] of
[00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.030] articulation
[00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:27.250] for
[00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:27.430] a

[00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:27.890] or
[00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:28.050] a
[00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:28.210] G.
[00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:28.790] So,
[00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:28.910] you
[00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:29.110] make
[00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.230] a
[00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.370] K
[00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:29.550] or
[00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:29.670] a
[00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:29.730] G
[00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.070] sound
[00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.970] and
[00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:31.150] then
[00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:31.330] just
[00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:31.490] let
[00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:31.630] air
[00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:31.830] flow
[00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.050] through
[00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:32.150] your
[00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:32.310] nose.
[00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:33.330] That's
[00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:33.630] the
[00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.070] sound
[00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.210] at
[00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:34.310] the
[00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.550] end
[00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:34.690] of

[00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:35.170] like
[00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:35.590] song
[00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.150] or
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:36.800] king.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:37.980] You're
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.180] making
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:38.320] a
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:38.540] velar
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:38.800] nasal.
[00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:40.230] English
[00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.550] doesn't
[00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:40.850] allow
[00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:41.370] words
[00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:41.510] to
[00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.730] begin
[00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:41.910] with
[00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:42.150] velar
[00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:42.470] nasals,
[00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:43.630] but
[00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:43.750] there
[00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.850] are
[00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:44.110] languages
[00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.330] that
[00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:44.530] do.
[00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:46.410] Tagalog,
[00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:46.610] for
[00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.910] example,
[00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:47.470] the

[00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:52.050] So,
[00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.130] it
[00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.350] starts
[00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:52.490] with
[00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.570] a

[00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.770] Tagalog
[00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:55.950] is
[00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:56.190] learning
[00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.310] how
[00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.410] to

[00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:58.030] nasals.
[00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:58.470] If

[00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:08.150] again.
[00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:08.650] So,
[00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:08.810] we've
[00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:08.930] got

[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:30.740] We

[00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:35.230] We
[00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:35.350] don't
[00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.510] have

[00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.390] Tagalog
[00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:43.570] is

[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:46.800] But
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.360] English
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:47.920] doesn't

[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:49.520] Yes.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:58.300] Oh,
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:58.460] yeah.
[00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:05.390] Yeah.
[00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:06.270] So,
[00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.990] we
[00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.290] haven't
[00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:07.450] yet
[00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:07.710] gotten

[00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:09.270] Jay,
[00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:09.510] the

[00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:10.210] at
[00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:10.290] the

[00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.590] of
[00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:10.650] the
[00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:10.870] year.
[00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.930] You're
[00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:12.210] absolutely
[00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:12.530] right.
[00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:12.750] There's
[00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.870] a
[00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:13.090] gap
[00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:13.410] there.
[00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:14.470] And
[00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.570] I
[00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.770] put
[00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:14.990] the
[00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.410] palatal
[00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:15.830] line
[00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:16.250] there
[00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.250] partly
[00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:17.510] to
[00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.670] get
[00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:17.810] you
[00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.950] to
[00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:18.210] ask

[00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:19.450] question.
[00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:19.910] So,
[00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.070] one
[00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:20.170] of
[00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:20.350] the
[00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:20.850] points
[00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:21.050] of
[00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.450] this
[00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:22.190] table,
[00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:22.910] it's
[00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:23.070] kind
[00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:23.190] of
[00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.370] like
[00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:23.530] when
[00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:23.650] the
[00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:23.950] periodic
[00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:24.350] table
[00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:24.570] was
[00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:24.830] first
[00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:25.190] invented,
[00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:25.430] I
[00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.630] guess.
[00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:26.010] So,
[00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.090] we
[00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:26.190] have
[00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.330] the
[00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:26.670] system
[00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:26.870] for
[00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:27.830] categorizing
[00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.290] sounds.
[00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:28.850] And
[00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:29.050] now,
[00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:29.190] we
[00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.310] get
[00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.410] to
[00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:29.510] look
[00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.630] at
[00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:29.750] it
[00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.870] and
[00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:30.030] say,
[00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:30.170] well,
[00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.310] wait,
[00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:30.470] why
[00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.650] isn't
[00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:30.790] there
[00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:31.070] anything
[00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.450] there?
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:32.640] And
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:32.980] what
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:33.100] would
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:33.180] it
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:33.280] be
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:33.580] like
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:33.800] if
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.140] it
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:34.280] were
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:34.500] there?
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:34.920] We'll
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.120] do
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:35.260] a
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:35.340] little
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:35.480] bit
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:35.560] of
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:35.680] that
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:35.800] in
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:35.880] a
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.040] second.
[00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.630] But,
[00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:38.230] yeah,
[00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.450] you're
[00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.630] right.
[00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:39.030] So,
[00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:39.210] we
[00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:39.710] haven't
[00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.970] yet
[00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:41.090] talked
[00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:41.290] about
[00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:41.410] the
[00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:41.610] kind
[00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:41.730] of
[00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:42.030] sound
[00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.250] that
[00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:42.930] the
[00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:43.470] IPA
[00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.790] symbol,
[00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:44.110] Jay,
[00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.510] the
[00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.290] sound
[00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.430] we
[00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.630] usually
[00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:45.850] write
[00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:46.010] with
[00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.330] Y
[00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:46.530] in
[00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:46.810] English,
[00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:47.110] the
[00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:47.530] sound
[00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:47.650] at
[00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:47.750] the
[00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.930] beginning
[00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:48.130] of
[00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:48.190] the
[00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.410] year,
[00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:48.590] we
[00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.030] haven't
[00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.250] put
[00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.430] that
[00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.550] on
[00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.670] the
[00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:49.870] table
[00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:50.090] yet.
[00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:50.470] You're
[00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.610] right.
[00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.350] It's
[00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:51.530] not
[00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.650] a
[00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:51.970] stop.
[00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:52.950] It's
[00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:53.150] also
[00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:53.350] not
[00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:53.470] a
[00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.710] fricative
[00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.970] because
[00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:54.110] you're
[00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:54.270] not
[00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.590] making
[00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:55.310] any
[00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.630] turbulence
[00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:55.910] in
[00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:56.010] the
[00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:56.250] airflow.
[00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:57.010] And
[00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:57.190] it's
[00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.350] not
[00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:57.630] nasal.
[00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.170] So,
[00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.430] it's
[00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.590] another
[00:34:58.590 --> 00:34:58.770] kind
[00:34:58.770 --> 00:34:58.870] of
[00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:59.030] thing.
[00:34:59.170 --> 00:34:59.350] We'll
[00:34:59.350 --> 00:34:59.470] get
[00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.610] to
[00:34:59.610 --> 00:34:59.790] it.
[00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.410] Good
[00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:01.730] question.
[00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:02.050] Other
[00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:02.650] questions?
[00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:04.150] All
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.760] right.
[00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:09.450] So,
[00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.970] yeah.
[00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.270] Okay.
[00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.650] So,
[00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.030] this
[00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.470] way
[00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.570] of
[00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:12.110] classifying
[00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:12.270] the
[00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.530] sounds
[00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.850] leads
[00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:12.970] us
[00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:13.070] to
[00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:13.210] wonder
[00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:13.410] about
[00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:13.670] gaps.
[00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:14.310] Yes,
[00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.950] thanks,
[00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.230] Norbin.
[00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:15.430] Yeah,
[00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.630] you
[00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.870] set
[00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.990] that
[00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.150] up
[00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.410] nicely.
[00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:19.730] So,
[00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:19.970] let's
[00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:20.130] think
[00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:20.310] about
[00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.490] some
[00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:20.590] of
[00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:20.730] these
[00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:21.050] gaps.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:22.320] So,
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:22.700] English,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:22.920] for
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.220] example,
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:23.940] has
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:24.520] bilabial
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.040] stops,
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:25.580] P
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:25.780] and
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:25.980] B,
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:26.460] and
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:26.580] it
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:26.860] has
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:27.240] a
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:27.680] bilabial
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.000] nasal,
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:28.340] an
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:28.580] M,
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.180] but
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:29.280] it
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:29.480] doesn't
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:29.600] have
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:29.720] a
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.180] bilabial
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:30.540] fricative.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:32.520] What
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:32.640] would
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:32.720] a
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.060] bilabial
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:33.320] fricative
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:33.580] sound
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:33.840] like?
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:37.900] It
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:37.960] would
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.100] sound
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.280] kind
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:38.340] of
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:38.480] like
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:38.720] blowing
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:38.900] out
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.020] a
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:39.260] candle,
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:39.640] right?
[00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.570] Open
[00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:40.690] your
[00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:40.870] lips
[00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:41.090] just
[00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:41.290] enough
[00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:41.390] to
[00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.510] let
[00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.630] some
[00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.730] air
[00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:41.890] come
[00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:42.050] out
[00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.170] and
[00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.330] then
[00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:42.530] blow.
[00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:44.190] Ah,
[00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:44.450] that's
[00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.530] a
[00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:44.910] bilabial
[00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:45.270] trill.
[00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:45.510] We
[00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.630] will
[00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.770] get
[00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.910] to
[00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:46.130] that.
[00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:49.010] Either
[00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.190] that
[00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.250] or
[00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:49.330] you
[00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:49.430] were
[00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.590] just
[00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:49.770] having
[00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:50.010] fun.
[00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:50.190] I'm
[00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.330] not
[00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:50.510] sure.
[00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:51.730] There
[00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:52.130] are
[00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.450] languages
[00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:52.670] that
[00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.850] have
[00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:53.070] that.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:54.960] Okay.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:55.360] So,
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:55.560] but
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:55.760] a
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.100] bilabial
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:56.320] fricative,
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:56.660] English
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:56.980] doesn't
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:57.140] have
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:57.260] a
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:57.640] bilabial
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:57.980] fricative,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:58.560] but
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.000] there
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:35:59.080] are
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:35:59.360] languages
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:35:59.560] that
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:35:59.720] do.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:00.260] Japanese
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:00.640] does,
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:00.820] for
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.120] example.
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:01.460] So,
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:01.640] in
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.040] Japanese,
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:02.640] the
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.060] sound
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:03.300] that
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:03.440] when
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:03.660] people
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:03.820] were
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.000] writing
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:04.480] Japanese
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:04.640] in
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:04.740] the
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:04.880] Roman
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.200] alphabet,
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:05.900] when
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:06.020] they
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:06.260] write
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:06.420] an
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:06.760] F,
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:07.840] when
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:07.980] they
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.380] write
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.000] the
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.200] name
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:09.320] of
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:09.520] this
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:09.860] mountain,
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:10.600] they'll
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:10.760] write
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:10.840] it
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:10.980] with
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.100] an
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:11.320] F.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:11.720] But
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:11.860] in
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.180] Japanese,
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:12.620] that's
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:12.780] not
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:12.960] an
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:13.180] F.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:13.420] It's
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:13.540] a
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:13.960] bilabial
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.300] fricative.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:14.600] It's
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.040] huji,
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:15.600] huji.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:16.380] If
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:16.480] you
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:16.720] learn
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.100] Japanese,
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:17.480] you
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:17.660] must
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:17.960] learn
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.600] to
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.220] pronounce
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:19.480] the
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:19.700] F
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.960] bilabially
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.700] rather
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.080] than
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.000] labiodentally.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:23.400] So,
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:23.520] in
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:23.740] English,
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:23.900] we
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.040] have
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:24.140] a
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:24.660] labiodental
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.040] F
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.760] with
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.020] our

[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:27.520] lip
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:27.800] against
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.040] our
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.400] teeth.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.160] In
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:29.560] Japanese,
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:29.880] F,
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:30.400] your
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:30.600] teeth
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:30.720] are
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:30.880] not
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.240] involved.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:31.440] It
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:31.560] is
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:31.740] only
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:31.940] your
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.180] lips.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:34.740] What
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:34.940] would
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.120] a
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.740] bilabial
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.160] fricative
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:39.420] sound
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:39.560] like?
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:39.680] Is
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:39.820] this
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:39.940] a
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:40.140] voiced
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:40.300] or
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:40.420] a
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:40.660] voiceless
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.240] bilabial
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:41.560] fricative?
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.160] Voiceless.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:44.560] What
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:44.660] would
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:44.780] it
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:44.900] sound
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:45.080] like
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:45.180] if
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:45.260] it
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:45.380] were
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:45.660] voiced?
[00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:47.690] And
[00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.830] that
[00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:49.190] exists
[00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.570] too.
[00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:50.470] There
[00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.530] are
[00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:50.870] dialects
[00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.970] of
[00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:51.290] Spanish,
[00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:51.470] for
[00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.710] example,

[00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.170] vowels.
[00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:54.330] If
[00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:54.450] you
[00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:54.570] have
[00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:54.710] the

[00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.510] in
[00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.710] words
[00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.910] like
[00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:57.330] abuela,
[00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:00.230] that
[00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.450] B
[00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:00.690] has
[00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:01.170] that

[00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.510] Moving
[00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.790] across

[00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:08.210] I've
[00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.330] got
[00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:08.490] a

[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:16.560] were

[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:18.860] I
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:18.960] should
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.160] step

[00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:02.810] that
[00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:02.990] she's
[00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.110] not

[00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:04.830] fricative.
[00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.070] Yes.
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:08.700] Is

[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:10.220] fricative?
[00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:11.730] Voiceless.
[00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:12.030] Yeah.
[00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:14.130] English

[00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:15.650] but
[00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:15.890] there
[00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:16.050] are
[00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:16.290] languages
[00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:16.530] that

[00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.670] Languages
[00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.850] like
[00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:18.110] German,
[00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.430] say,

[00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:26.190] Sebastian
[00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.530] Bach.
[00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.470] His

[00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:31.410] Yeah.
[00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:33.290] It
[00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:33.470] shows
[00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.630] up
[00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.750] in

[00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:36.330] Chekhov,
[00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:36.730] that
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:37.680] sound.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:39.520] What
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:39.720] would
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.420] a
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:40.720] velar
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:40.980] fricative
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.240] sound
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:41.440] like
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:41.540] if
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:41.640] it
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:41.760] were
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.100] voiced?
[00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:47.490] And
[00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:49.230] English
[00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.470] doesn't
[00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.590] have
[00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:49.770] that
[00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:49.990] either,
[00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.610] but
[00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:51.270] there
[00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.330] are
[00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:51.610] languages
[00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:51.830] that
[00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:52.030] do.
[00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.290] Again,
[00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:52.410] there
[00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:52.470] are
[00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.810] dialects
[00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:52.870] of
[00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:53.150] Spanish
[00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.530] where
[00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:53.650] if
[00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:53.710] you
[00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.850] have
[00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:54.010] a
[00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:54.190] G
[00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.570] between
[00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:54.970] vowels,
[00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.430] it'll
[00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.810] get
[00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:55.990] this
[00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.130] kind
[00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:56.230] of
[00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.470] sound
[00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.650] in
[00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:57.030] words
[00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.230] like
[00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.470] agua.
[00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.390] Okay.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:01.980] So
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.220] we've
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:02.380] talked
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:02.560] about
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:02.820] various
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.080] kinds
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:03.240] of
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:03.660] nasals,
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:04.060] nasal
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:04.480] stops.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.000] So
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.020] an
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:06.340] M
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:06.820] is
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:06.920] a

[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:07.620] nasal,
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.000] right?
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:08.960] Where
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.260] you
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:09.940] close
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:10.100] the
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:10.240] flow
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:10.340] of
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:10.480] air
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:10.660] at
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:10.760] your
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.020] lips,
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.380] allow
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:12.700] the
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:12.880] air
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.020] to
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:13.220] flow
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:13.480] through
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:13.920] your
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.220] nasal
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:14.500] cavity
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:14.720] by
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.000] lowering
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.180] your
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:15.480] velums,
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:15.620] you
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:15.760] get
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:15.940] an
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.100] M.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:17.520] Or
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:17.680] you
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:17.820] can
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.060] stop
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:18.220] the
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:18.380] flow
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:18.500] of
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:18.580] air
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:18.700] in
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:18.860] other
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:19.180] places.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:19.420] You
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:19.560] can
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:19.680] have
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:19.760] an
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.160] alveolar
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.460] nasal,
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:20.740] right?
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:21.660] You
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:21.800] can
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:21.920] have
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.000] a
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:22.260] velar
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:22.540] nasal.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:23.980] What
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:24.120] would
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.220] a
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:24.600] glottal
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:24.900] nasal
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:25.240] sound
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:25.480] like?
[00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.830] Trick
[00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:31.230] question.
[00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:31.430] You
[00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.570] would
[00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:31.770] need
[00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:32.170] surgery.
[00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:34.370] So
[00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:35.250] the
[00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:35.590] way
[00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.070] nasal
[00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.390] stops
[00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.870] work
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.960] is
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.300] you're
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:38.660] stopping
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:38.900] the
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.100] flow
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:39.240] of
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:39.440] air
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:39.740] somewhere
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:39.960] in
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.060] your

[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.000] tract,
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:41.560] but
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:41.740] you're
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.100] allowing
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:42.380] the
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:42.560] air
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:42.760] to
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.020] flow
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:43.340] through
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:43.600] your

[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.260] cavity,
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:44.900] right?
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.220] That's
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:45.360] what
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.000] a
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.180] nasal
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:46.540] stop
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:46.740] is.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:46.940] Here,
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:47.200] let's
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:47.400] get
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:47.660] back
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:47.760] to
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:47.880] one
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:47.980] of
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.140] these
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:48.440] sedgital
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:48.860] sections.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:50.600] So
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.120] that
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.500] N
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:51.980] there,
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.540] what
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.780] you're
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.100] doing
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.380] is
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:54.840] you're
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:55.140] stopping
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:55.320] the
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:55.480] flow
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:55.600] of
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:55.740] air
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:56.000] there
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.180] at
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:56.380] the
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:56.780] alveolar
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.200] ridge,
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:57.480] right?
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:57.920] But
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.080] you're
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:58.320] lowering
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:58.500] the
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:58.660] velum
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:58.820] to
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:39:58.960] let
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.080] the
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:39:59.220] air
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:39:59.400] flow
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:39:59.640] through.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.080] Or
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:00.240] an
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:00.500] M,
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.000] you'd
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.160] be
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:01.620] closing
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.040] the
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:02.240] flow
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:02.360] of
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:02.480] air
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:02.660] at
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:02.780] your
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.040] lips
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:03.540] and
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:03.860] lowering
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:04.040] your
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:04.240] velum
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:04.380] to
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:04.500] let
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:04.620] the

[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:04.980] flow
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.220] through.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:05.800] Or
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.380] a
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:06.620] velar
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:06.920] nasal,
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:07.580] like
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.000] at
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:08.120] the
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:08.280] end
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:08.400] of
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:08.720] King,
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:09.380] yeah?
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:09.960] You're
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.380] making
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:10.540] a
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:10.800] closure
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.060] at
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:11.160] the
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:11.440] velum,
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:11.640] but
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:11.760] you're
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:11.960] also
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.320] lowering
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.520] the
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:12.760] velum
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:12.880] and
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.080] letting
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:13.240] the
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:13.380] air
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:13.560] flow
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:13.760] through.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:14.600] A
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:14.940] glottal
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:15.240] nasal,
[00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:16.670] you'd
[00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.810] have
[00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:16.970] to
[00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:17.210] stop
[00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.390] the
[00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.590] flow
[00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:17.750] of
[00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.970] air
[00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:18.450] down
[00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:18.770] there
[00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:19.230] at
[00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.590] the
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.100] vocal
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:22.460] folds,
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:23.600] and
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:23.820] let
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:23.980] the
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.140] air
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:24.320] go
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:24.520] through
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:24.700] your
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:24.980] velum.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:26.400] But
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:26.580] if
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:26.720] you're
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:26.980] stopping
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.120] it
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:27.300] down
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:27.540] there,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:27.780] it
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:27.960] can't
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.100] be
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:28.280] going
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:28.480] through
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:28.640] your
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:28.900] velum.
[00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.950] So
[00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:30.050] you
[00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.170] would
[00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.470] need,
[00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:30.810] again,
[00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.030] as
[00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.130] I
[00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.330] say,
[00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:32.330] probably
[00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:32.630] there
[00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.890] are
[00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:33.450] unethical
[00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:33.830] surgeons
[00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:34.130] who
[00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.270] would
[00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.550] modify
[00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.850] you
[00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:35.010] so
[00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:35.130] that
[00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:35.210] you
[00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.330] could
[00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:35.530] make
[00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:35.850] glottal
[00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:36.170] nasals.
[00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:36.350] You
[00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:36.730] need
[00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:37.130] extra
[00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.630] ways
[00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.770] to
[00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:37.890] get
[00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:38.050] air
[00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:38.190] to
[00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:38.370] flow
[00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:38.710] through
[00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.950] your
[00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:39.530] nasal
[00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.830] cavity.
[00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.350] I'm
[00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:40.530] not
[00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:40.950] recommending
[00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:41.450] this,
[00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.650] by
[00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:41.750] the
[00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.910] way.
[00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.210] All
[00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:45.430] right,
[00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:48.290] cool.
[00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:51.050] So
[00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:51.210] those
[00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:51.310] are
[00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:51.450] some
[00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:51.550] of
[00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.670] the
[00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:52.010] gaps.
[00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:54.070] Oh,
[00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:54.350] and
[00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:54.510] I
[00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.110] flagged
[00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:55.350] a
[00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:55.550] gap
[00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.790] that
[00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:56.170] I
[00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:56.350] didn't
[00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:56.530] talk
[00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:56.710] about.
[00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.930] Sorry,
[00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:57.430] a
[00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.490] couple
[00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:57.710] gaps.
[00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:59.170] So
[00:40:59.170 --> 00:40:59.610] English
[00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:00.350] has
[00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:01.510] interdental
[00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:02.010] fricatives,
[00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:02.390] th
[00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.750] and
[00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.990] th.
[00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:03.330] And
[00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:03.450] as
[00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:03.570] I
[00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:03.730] said,
[00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:03.930] those
[00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:04.030] are
[00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.230] cross
[00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.670]-linguistically
[00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:05.190] kind
[00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.330] of
[00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:05.610] rare,
[00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:06.150] which
[00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.330] is
[00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:06.690] why
[00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:07.750] if
[00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:08.110] you're
[00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:08.710] trying
[00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.910] to
[00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:09.090] do
[00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:09.250] an
[00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:09.610] accent
[00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:10.170] from
[00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:10.530] various
[00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:10.770] kinds
[00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:10.910] of
[00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:11.170] places,
[00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:11.390] for
[00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.650] example,
[00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:11.890] in
[00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:12.170] Europe,
[00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.970] one
[00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:13.070] of
[00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:13.190] the
[00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.370] things
[00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.530] you
[00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:13.750] do
[00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.970] is
[00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:14.390] replace
[00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.650] your
[00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:14.850] TH
[00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:15.390] sounds
[00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.590] with
[00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:15.770] other

[00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.170] of
[00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:16.510] sounds.
[00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:16.970] So
[00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:17.310] if
[00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:17.450] you're
[00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.630] doing
[00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.750] a

[00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:46.690] So
[00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:46.970] you're

[00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.510] those,
[00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:54.030] but
[00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.150] there
[00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.250] are
[00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:54.530] languages

[00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.930] there
[00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:55.090] that

[00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:56.330] If

[00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.690] this
[00:41:58.690 --> 00:41:58.790] is
[00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.890] a
[00:41:58.890 --> 00:41:59.030] kind
[00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.150] of

[00:41:59.570 --> 00:41:59.750] about,
[00:41:59.830 --> 00:41:59.970] because
[00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:00.270] sometimes
[00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.470] your
[00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.710] teacher

[00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:02.210] this.
[00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:03.090] But
[00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:03.190] you
[00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.330] should
[00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:03.470] be
[00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.710] asking
[00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:04.050] yourself,

[00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.670] is
[00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.790] it
[00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.930] an

[00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.550] Part
[00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.650] of
[00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:10.750] your
[00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.970] job,
[00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:11.130] if
[00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:11.230] you're
[00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.510] learning
[00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.950] Tagalog,
[00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.290] for
[00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:12.590] example,
[00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:13.090] is
[00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:13.210] to
[00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:13.350] learn
[00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:13.490] to
[00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.630] make
[00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:13.950] dental
[00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:14.230] Ts
[00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.670] instead
[00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.870] of
[00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:15.230] alveolar
[00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.590] Ts,
[00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.910] because
[00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:16.170] that's
[00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:16.290] what
[00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:16.510] they've
[00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.790] got.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:25.880] Have
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.180] teeth?
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:27.320] Yes.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:31.420] Well,
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.300] I
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:35.480] think,
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.000] I
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:36.400] believe
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:36.620] that
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:36.820] is
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.000] what
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:37.240] people
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:37.500] do,
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:37.780] yeah.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.340] So
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:38.620] you
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.240] make
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:39.760] a
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.100] closure.
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.100] We
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:41.220] can
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:41.360] talk
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:41.520] about
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:41.980] interdental
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:42.360] fricatives,
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:42.700] right?
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.160] So
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:43.420] somebody
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:43.580] who
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:43.840] doesn't
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:44.020] have
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:44.340] teeth
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:44.760] and
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.000] wants
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:45.160] to
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:45.300] do
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:45.480] a
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:45.720] TH,
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:46.780] what
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:46.900] do
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:47.020] they
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:47.260] do?
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:47.520] I
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:47.700] think
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:47.960] their
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.360] job
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:48.600] is
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:48.800] to
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.300] create
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.340] a
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:50.660] turbulent
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.100] airflow
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:51.720] with
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:51.920] their
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.220] tongue
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:52.860] between
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.380] where
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:53.600] their
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:53.800] teeth
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.000] would
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.200] be
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:54.380] if
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:54.500] they
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:54.740] only
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:54.980] had
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:55.360] teeth,
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.080] right?
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.140] And
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:57.280] I
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:57.420] think
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:57.800] there's
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.020] something
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:58.320] similar
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:58.560] going
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:58.740] on

[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:24.380] make,
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:24.900] the
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:25.220] languages
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:25.420] of
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:25.700] Australia,
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:25.940] at
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.080] least,
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:26.360] often
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:26.620] don't
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:27.000] make
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.180] voicing
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:28.660] distinctions.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:28.940] So
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.060] they
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:29.240] have
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:29.600] stops,
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:29.800] but
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:29.920] they
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.080] don't
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:30.440] distinguish
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:30.820] voiced
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:31.060] from,
[00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:32.230] so
[00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.470] they
[00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.730] have
[00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:33.530] places
[00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:33.710] of
[00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:34.250] articulation
[00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.730] and
[00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.070] lots
[00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:36.230] of
[00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.390] them,
[00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:36.850] and
[00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:37.210] nasals
[00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:37.370] and
[00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:37.510] all
[00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.650] those
[00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:37.930] places
[00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:38.190] as
[00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.370] well,
[00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.550] but
[00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:38.750] no
[00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:39.090] distinction
[00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:39.430] between
[00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.730] voiced
[00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:39.870] and
[00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:40.070] voiceless.
[00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.450] Yeah.
[00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:43.130] Okay.
[00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:43.790] Any
[00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.930] other
[00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:44.250] questions
[00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:44.450] about
[00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:44.610] this
[00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:44.870] chart
[00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:45.730] before
[00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:45.970] we
[00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:46.610] zoom
[00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:46.850] past
[00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:46.990] it?
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:48.860] Like
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:48.960] I
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.100] said,
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:49.480] I'm
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:49.560] going
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:49.740] to,
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:50.020] on
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.200] the
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:50.480] website
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:50.780] there
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:50.900] will
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:51.280] be
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.120] a
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:52.440] link
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:52.960] to
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.460] charts
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:54.660] that
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:54.760] will
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:54.960] look
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.500] hopefully
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:55.760] sort
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:55.860] of
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.020] like
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:56.280] this,
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:57.820] more
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:58.120] official
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:58.480] charts
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:58.900] by
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:44:59.080] the
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:44:59.540] IPA,
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:44:59.780] which
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:44:59.940] will
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.460] have
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.640] sound
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.080] files
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:02.320] so
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:02.460] that
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:02.560] you
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:02.700] can
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:02.960] listen
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.300] to
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:03.800] trained
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.380] phonologists
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:04.740] making
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:04.940] the
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.220] sounds,
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:05.720] and
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.120] also
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:06.940] at
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.060] least
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:07.460] one
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:07.820] website,
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.000] which
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.100] I
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:08.240] hope
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:08.340] is
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:08.500] still
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:08.680] up,
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.200] has
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.180] MRIs
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:10.320] so
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:10.440] that
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:10.520] you
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:10.660] can
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:10.960] watch
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.140] the
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:11.400] inside
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:11.620] of
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:11.820] a
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:12.180] person's
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:12.420] vocal
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:12.680] tract
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:12.900] as
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.100] they
[00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.850] make
[00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:13.990] the
[00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.210] sound.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:16.420] Okay.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.020] Now,
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.100] we
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:20.280] have
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:20.420] been
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:20.760] talking
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.060] about
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:21.340] parts
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:21.560] of
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.220] the
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:22.420] vocal
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:22.640] tract
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:22.780] that
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:23.040] English
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.620] uses.
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.020] Sometimes
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:25.220] it
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:25.440] doesn't
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:25.680] use
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:25.820] them
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:25.960] for
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:26.080] the
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:26.220] same
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:26.480] things
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:26.640] other
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.020] languages
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:27.260] do,
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:27.480] so
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:27.640] we
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:27.800] have
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.100] teeth.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:28.300] We
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:28.480] use
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:28.620] our
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:28.800] teeth
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.000] for
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:29.540] interdentals,
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:29.700] but
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:29.800] we
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:29.940] don't
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:30.080] make
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:30.380] dental
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:30.820] stops.
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.060] But
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:32.200] there
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:32.300] are
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:32.600] places
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.140] in
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:33.660] the
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:33.900] vocal
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:34.120] tract
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:34.300] that
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:34.540] English
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:34.840] just
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.020] does
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:35.220] not
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:35.560] use,
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:35.780] and
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:35.960] yet
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:36.360] other
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:36.740] languages
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:37.040] do.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:38.080] Here
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:38.200] are
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:38.320] a
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:38.500] couple.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:39.420] There
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:39.540] are
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:39.660] what
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:39.760] are
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:39.940] called
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:40.560] retroflex
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:40.980] sounds.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:41.520] These
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:41.620] are
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:41.960] sounds
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.120] in
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:42.340] which
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:42.660] the
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:42.820] tip
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:42.940] of
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:43.080] your
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:43.300] tongue
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:43.500] is
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:43.680] on
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:43.940] your
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:44.300] palate.
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:44.980] So
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:45.640] instead
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:45.820] of
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:45.980] a
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:46.340] t,
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.160] you're
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:47.460] making
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:47.700] a
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:47.960] k,
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:48.380] a
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:48.540] k.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.200] So
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:50.460] your
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:50.720] tongue
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:50.960] is
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.280] curled
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:51.520] back
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:51.660] a
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:51.780] little
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:51.960] bit
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.260] further
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:52.460] than
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:52.580] it
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:52.740] would
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:52.900] be
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:53.100] for
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:53.300] a
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:53.420] t,
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:53.980] and
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:54.120] it's
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.380] making
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:54.780] a
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.240] closure
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:55.460] if

[00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:42.750] symbols
[00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.950] on
[00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:43.250] it,
[00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.650] including
[00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:43.850] some
[00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:43.950] of
[00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.990] the
[00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.110] ones
[00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:44.250] we've
[00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:44.410] talked
[00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:44.610] about.
[00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:45.050] Pharyngeal,
[00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:45.510] uvulars,
[00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:46.250] retroflexes.
[00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:48.170] And
[00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.310] for
[00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:48.490] some
[00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:48.730] reason,
[00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:48.950] the
[00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:49.170] dental
[00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:49.490] stops
[00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:49.650] are
[00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:49.830] still
[00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:50.050] red.
[00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:50.190] I
[00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:50.310] don't
[00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:50.450] know
[00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.650] why.
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:52.860] Yep,
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:53.820] this
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:53.840] is
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:53.960] a
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.120] chart.
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:49:59.240] Okay,
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:49:59.760] now,
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.100] people
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:01.340] keep
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:01.620] asking
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:01.880] me
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.140] about
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:02.640] sounds
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:02.880] that
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.020] I've
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:03.160] been
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:03.420] carefully
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:03.800] avoiding,
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.000] so
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.180] let's
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:04.320] talk
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:04.480] about
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:04.640] them.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.240] There
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:06.640] are
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.120] what
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:07.240] are
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:07.580] called
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.460] approximants.
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:11.500] Approximants
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:11.720] are
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:11.940] not
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:12.440] stops,
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:12.900] and
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:13.000] they're
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:13.220] not
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:13.660] fricatives,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:14.400] and
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:14.540] they're
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:14.760] not
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:15.220] nasals.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:15.860] They
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:16.660] involve
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:17.740] your
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.540] articulators
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:18.960] kind
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.180] of
[00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:19.640] vaguely
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.360] gesturing
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:20.800] towards
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.060] each
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:21.320] other
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:22.320] in
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:22.640] some
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.000] part
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:23.120] of
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:23.240] your
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:23.480] vocal
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:23.900] tract.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:24.720] Not
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.460] enough
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:25.840] to
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:26.080] make,
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:26.280] you
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:26.340] know,
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:26.620] definitely
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:26.840] not
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.060] making
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:27.420] contact,
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:27.740] and
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:27.960] not
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:28.180] enough
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:28.340] to
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:28.600] cause
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:28.820] any
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:29.160] turbulence
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:29.440] in
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:29.560] the
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:29.820] airflow.
[00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:30.750] So
[00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:31.250] if
[00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.330] you
[00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:31.490] think
[00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.670] about
[00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.790] a
[00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:32.110] W,
[00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.490] let's
[00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:32.670] say,
[00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.450] in
[00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:34.750] the
[00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.890] middle
[00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:35.050] of
[00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:35.150] a
[00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.290] word
[00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:35.550] like
[00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:35.930] away,
[00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:37.030] yeah,
[00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:37.910] that's
[00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:38.190] not
[00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:38.330] a
[00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:38.570] stop,
[00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:38.690] and
[00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.790] it's
[00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.950] not
[00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:39.050] a
[00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.290] fricative,
[00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:39.430] and
[00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.550] it's
[00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:39.710] not
[00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.990] nasal.
[00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.530] It's
[00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:41.050] bilabial.
[00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:41.410] You
[00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:41.530] can
[00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:41.690] feel
[00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.910] your
[00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:42.190] lips
[00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:43.370] engaging
[00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.770] as
[00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:43.870] you
[00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:44.050] make
[00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:44.210] the
[00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.490] W
[00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:44.650] in
[00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:44.750] the
[00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.930] middle
[00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:45.110] of
[00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:45.510] away.
[00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:46.030] It's
[00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:46.130] a
[00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:46.650] bilabial
[00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:47.110] sound,
[00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.770] but
[00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:47.950] it's
[00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:48.090] not
[00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:48.210] a
[00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:48.870] bilabial
[00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:49.190] stop
[00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.330] or
[00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:49.430] a
[00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.650] fricative.
[00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.870] It
[00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:50.010] is
[00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:50.170] a
[00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:50.710] bilabial
[00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:51.470] approximant.
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:53.740] So
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:54.240] similarly
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:54.600] for
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:54.840] the
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.260] Y
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.240] sound
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:56.440] at
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:56.540] the
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:56.740] beginning
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:56.960] of
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:57.300] year
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:57.680] or
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.080] yard,
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:50:59.620] and
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:50:59.820] the
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.180] L
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:00.440] and
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:00.600] the
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.000] R
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.420] at
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:02.640] the
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:02.960] beginning
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:03.160] and
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:03.440] end
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:03.760] of,
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:03.880] I
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:03.960] don't
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:04.100] know,
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:04.520] lair
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.220] or
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:06.880] rail.
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:08.320] Those
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:08.540] are
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:08.940] all
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:09.780] approximants.
[00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:11.630] They
[00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:12.110] are
[00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:12.650] sometimes
[00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:13.250] divided
[00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.790] into
[00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:14.590] glides
[00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:14.970] and
[00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:15.410] liquids,
[00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:16.630] and
[00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.910] I'm
[00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:17.250] hoping
[00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:17.510] that
[00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.830] nobody
[00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:18.050] will
[00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:18.410] ask
[00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.650] me
[00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:18.890] how
[00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:19.070] you
[00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:19.370] know
[00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:19.650] whether
[00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:20.010] something
[00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:20.210] is
[00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.310] a
[00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:20.590] glide
[00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:20.750] or
[00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.910] a
[00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:21.150] liquid.
[00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:22.410] Are
[00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:22.510] you
[00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.670] about
[00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.810] to
[00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:22.990] ask
[00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:23.110] me
[00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:23.270] how
[00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.410] you
[00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:23.570] know
[00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:23.750] whether
[00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:24.030] something
[00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.190] is
[00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.270] a
[00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:24.430] glide
[00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.570] or
[00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:24.670] a
[00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.810] liquid?
[00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.490] Go
[00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:27.050] ahead.
[00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.210] Is
[00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:27.290] that
[00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:27.410] what
[00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.510] you're?
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:28.860] Yes.
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:29.200] Okay.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:29.400] All
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:29.500] right.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:29.820] Fine.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.080] So
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.080] a
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:32.460] glide,
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:32.720] I
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:32.920] mean,
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.680] sometimes
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.120] it's
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:34.240] as
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:34.520] though
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:34.780] a
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:35.120] glide
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.120] is
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:36.700] an
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:37.300] approximant
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:37.740] that
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:38.380] if
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:38.520] you
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:38.640] were
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:38.820] to
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:39.060] hold
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:39.240] it
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:39.600] longer,
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:39.860] it
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.000] would
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.180] be
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:40.340] a
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:40.600] vowel.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:41.700] So
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.360] a
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:42.740] W,
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:43.440] if
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:43.580] you
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:43.840] just
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.220] freeze
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:44.740] yourself
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:45.260] in
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.080] W
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:46.680] space,
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.700] you're
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:47.980] making
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:48.240] an
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:48.620] OO.
[00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:49.810] A
[00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:50.050] W
[00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:50.330] is
[00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:50.550] like
[00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:50.810] an
[00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:51.190] OO
[00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.830] sped
[00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:52.090] up.
[00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:52.790] We're
[00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.850] going
[00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:52.870] to
[00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:53.010] talk
[00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:53.190] about
[00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.430] vowels
[00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.770] later,
[00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:53.950] but
[00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:54.050] if
[00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:54.110] you
[00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:54.270] think
[00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:54.530] about
[00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:55.050] what
[00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:55.250] an
[00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.630] OO
[00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:56.150] is,
[00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.770] it's
[00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:57.230] a
[00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.010] held
[00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:58.450] version
[00:51:58.450 --> 00:51:58.610] of
[00:51:58.610 --> 00:51:58.710] a
[00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.930] W.
[00:51:59.370 --> 00:51:59.570] And
[00:51:59.570 --> 00:51:59.970] similarly,
[00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:00.530] a
[00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:01.010] Y
[00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:01.530] sound
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.060] is
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:03.440] a
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:03.920] sped
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.100] up
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:04.420] version
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:04.640] of
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:04.820] an
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:05.160] E,
[00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:07.090] as
[00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:07.270] opposed
[00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.490] to
[00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.650] an
[00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:07.890] R
[00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:08.130] or
[00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:08.250] an
[00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:08.490] L,
[00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:09.050] which
[00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:09.170] are
[00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:09.510] just
[00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.870] some.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:12.320] Because
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:12.580] I
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:12.780] have
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:12.980] not
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.240] given
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:13.520] you
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:13.740] a
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:13.860] good
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:14.060] way
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:14.180] of
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:14.640] distinguishing
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:14.980] glides
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:15.200] from
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:15.480] liquids,
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:15.900] you
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:16.120] can
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:16.560] trust
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:16.760] me
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:16.940] that
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:17.040] I
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:17.200] will
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:17.500] never
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.120] ask
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:18.280] you
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:18.600] to
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:18.980] distinguish
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:19.240] them
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:19.380] in
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:19.500] a
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:19.580] way
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:19.720] that
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:19.820] will
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:19.980] make
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:20.100] a
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:20.400] difference
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:20.660] for
[00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:20.880] like
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.160] grades
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:21.340] or
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:21.580] anything
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:21.820] like
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:22.000] that.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:22.160] You
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:22.480] will
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:22.660] never
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:22.860] see
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:23.020] me
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:23.220] saying,
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:23.400] no,
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:23.600] you're
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:23.800] wrong,
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.060] that's
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:24.180] not
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:24.260] a
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:24.480] glide,
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:24.700] it's
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:24.800] a
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:24.980] liquid.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:25.400] I
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:25.500] mean,
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:25.600] I
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:25.760] may
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:25.940] say
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:26.140] that,
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:26.380] but
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:27.540] there
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:27.760] won't
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:27.960] be
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.320] minus
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:28.720] five
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.040] next
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:29.180] to
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:29.520] it.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:30.820] Yeah.
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:43.220] Having
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:46.020] two
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:46.280] letters.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:46.660] You
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:46.740] know,
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:46.940] that's
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:47.020] a
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:47.120] really
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:47.280] good
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:47.540] question.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:47.760] So
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:47.920] why
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.060] don't
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:48.200] we
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:48.440] just
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:48.780] use
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:48.980] the
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:49.240] letter
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:49.740] OO
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:50.760] for
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.580] the
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.240] bilabial
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:52.520] glide,
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:52.760] for
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.200] the
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:53.380] W.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:55.640] And
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.360] let
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:56.440] me
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:56.560] see
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:56.660] if
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:56.740] I
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:56.860] can
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:57.020] come
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:57.120] up
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:57.200] with
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:57.280] a
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:57.380] good
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:57.660] answer
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:57.820] to
[00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.100] that.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:00.520] So
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:01.980] far,
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:02.200] all
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:02.340] we're
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:02.520] doing
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:02.640] is
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:02.880] talking
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.120] about
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:03.660] sounds
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:04.280] individually.
[00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.730] And
[00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:06.050] eventually,
[00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:06.350] we're
[00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:06.450] going
[00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:06.570] to
[00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:06.830] start
[00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:07.250] talking
[00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.830] about
[00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:08.690] sequences
[00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:09.050] of
[00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:09.490] sounds.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:10.760] And
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.560] we're
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:11.620] going
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:11.720] to
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:11.860] want
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:11.960] to
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.080] be
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:12.240] able
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:12.440] to
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:12.780] talk
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:13.220] about
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.380] restrictions
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.080] on
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:15.360] the
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:15.620] ways
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:15.820] in
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:15.960] which
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:16.300] sounds
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:16.500] get
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:16.640] to
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.000] interact
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.200] with
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:17.400] each
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:17.600] other.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:18.460] And
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:18.580] so
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:18.740] it's
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:18.820] going
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:18.860] to
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:18.980] be
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:19.280] useful
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:19.560] at
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:19.760] that
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:19.980] point
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:20.140] to
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:20.240] be
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:20.360] able
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:20.600] to
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.000] distinguish,
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:21.360] for
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:21.760] example,
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:22.680] consonants
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:22.880] from
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.280] vowels.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.080] And
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.860] once
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.080] we
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:26.400] do
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:26.840] that,
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:27.480] and
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:27.600] you
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:27.740] should
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:27.880] feel
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:28.020] free
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:28.160] to
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:28.340] call
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:28.520] me
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:28.700] on
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:28.920] this
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.040] if
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:29.160] it
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:29.440] doesn't
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:29.620] come
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:29.820] up
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:30.140] later.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:31.020] I'll
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:31.180] try
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:31.300] to
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:31.460] make
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:31.600] sure
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:31.740] it
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:32.080] does.
[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:33.260] It'll
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:33.480] turn
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:33.660] out
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:33.780] to
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:33.920] be
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.260] useful
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:34.500] to
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:34.720] be
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:34.860] able
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:35.040] to
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:35.300] think
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:35.580] of
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.320] the
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:36.680] consonant
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.340] version
[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:37.560] of
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:37.700] the
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.000] sound,
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:38.200] the
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:38.420] W,
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:38.940] and
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:39.200] also
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:39.380] the
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:39.600] vowel
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:39.980] version
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:40.180] of
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:40.420] the
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:40.640] sound,
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:40.860] the
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:41.080] OO.
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:41.920] But
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:42.100] you're
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:42.220] right
[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:42.400] that
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:42.520] there
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:42.600] are
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:42.820] plenty
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:43.040] of
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:43.560] sound
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.000] changes
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:44.500] where
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:44.960] you
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.240] see
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:45.540] them
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:46.360] converting
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.160] back
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:47.340] and
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:47.500] forth
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:47.780] between
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:48.000] each
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:48.180] other.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:48.440] That's
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:48.500] the
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:48.620] kind
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:48.720] of
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:48.880] thing
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.040] that
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:49.440] happens.
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:52.420] But
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:53.320] that's
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:53.460] the
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:53.620] prima
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:53.840] facie
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.120] reason
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:54.300] for
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:54.800] distinguishing
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.020] them,
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:55.240] because
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:55.540] there
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:56.040] are
[00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:57.350] rules
[00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:57.550] for
[00:53:57.550 --> 00:53:57.710] the
[00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:58.210] distribution
[00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:58.490] of
[00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:59.010] sounds
[00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:00.110] for
[00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:00.290] which
[00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.490] it's
[00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:00.710] useful
[00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.870] to
[00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:01.030] have
[00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.230] that
[00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:01.670] distinction.
[00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:02.430] It's
[00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.610] like
[00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:03.090] anything
[00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:03.390] else,
[00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:03.510] I
[00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.630] guess.
[00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.770] We
[00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.950] make
[00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:04.110] that
[00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:04.450] distinction
[00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:04.710] as
[00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:05.130] long
[00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:05.290] as
[00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:05.990] it
[00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.210] turns
[00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:06.330] out
[00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:06.430] to
[00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.510] be
[00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.790] useful
[00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.970] for
[00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:07.270] explaining
[00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.630] stuff.
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:09.600] Good
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.220] question.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:11.380] Yeah.
[00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:15.170] All
[00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.370] right.
[00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:17.950] Okay.
[00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:19.070] So
[00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:19.430] those
[00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.530] are
[00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:19.690] glides
[00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:19.790] and
[00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:20.010] liquids.
[00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.270] Okay.
[00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.530] And
[00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:20.890] then,
[00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:21.810] this
[00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:22.070] was,
[00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.430] Raquel
[00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.590] was
[00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:22.870] asking
[00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:23.070] about
[00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:23.250] this
[00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:23.630] before,
[00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:24.910] sounds
[00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:25.230] like
[00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:25.430] ch
[00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.830] and
[00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:26.150] j.
[00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:27.110] I
[00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:27.250] think
[00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:27.410] I
[00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.750] said
[00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:28.190] you
[00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.330] could
[00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:28.510] think
[00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.650] of
[00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:28.930] ch
[00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:29.650] as
[00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:29.870] like
[00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:30.010] a
[00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:30.350] stop,
[00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:30.570] a
[00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:30.910] T,
[00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:31.870] followed
[00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:32.150] by
[00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.270] a
[00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.570] fricative,
[00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:32.970] sh.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:35.620] Or
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.180] j,
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:36.960] the
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.280] j
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:37.520] at
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:37.700] the
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:38.000] beginning
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:38.240] and
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:38.520] end
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:38.700] of
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:38.840] a
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:39.040] word
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:39.280] like
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:39.740] judge,
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:41.360] as
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:41.720] being
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:41.900] a
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:42.220] stop,
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:42.400] a
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:42.620] D
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:43.160] sound,
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:43.700] followed
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:43.960] by
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:44.080] a
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:44.340] fricative,
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:44.620] a
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:44.840] j.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.400] There's
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:47.560] a
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:47.720] little
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:47.920] bit
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.040] of
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:48.180] a
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:48.520] debate
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.160] about
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:49.420] whether
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:49.620] what
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:49.740] I
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:49.940] just
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:50.200] said
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:50.320] is
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:50.460] the
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:50.580] right
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:50.720] way
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:50.820] to
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:50.960] think
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.120] about
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:51.300] this
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:51.400] or
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:51.640] not.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:51.800] I
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:51.960] think
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.160] the
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:52.440] standard
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:52.640] way
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:52.760] to
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:52.900] think
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.080] about
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:53.200] it
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:53.340] is
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:53.540] not
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:53.900] exactly
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:54.200] that.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:54.580] What
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:54.800] people
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.060] do
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:55.280] is
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:55.600] say,
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:56.460] yeah,
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:56.960] there's
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:57.280] this
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:57.700] package
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:58.140] deal,
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:58.420] an
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.020] affricate.
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:54:59.820] So
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:54:59.980] there's
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:00.140] a
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:00.400] name
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:00.560] for
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:00.740] this
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:00.940] kind
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:01.060] of
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:01.300] thing.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.200] An
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:02.660] affricate
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.160] is
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:03.940] this
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:04.200] kind
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:04.340] of
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:04.800] sequence,
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:05.440] something
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:05.720] like
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:05.840] a
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.060] stop,
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.020] followed
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:07.280] by
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:07.400] a
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:07.640] fricative.
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:08.840] And
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.320] the
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:10.740] arguments
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:10.960] about
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:11.160] whether
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:11.340] or
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:11.460] not
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:11.580] to
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:11.720] make
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:11.920] this
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.260] move,
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:12.480] about
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:12.620] whether
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:12.800] to
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:12.940] say,
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:13.100] no,
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:13.360] that's
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:13.480] a
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:13.720] single
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:14.220] sound
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:14.520] with
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:14.860] a
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:15.240] complex
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:15.780] motion,
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:16.560] as
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:16.720] opposed
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:16.860] to
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.020] saying,
[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:17.120] no,
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:17.340] there's
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:17.660] two
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:18.160] sounds
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:18.400] right
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:18.880] next
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:19.080] to
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:19.240] each
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:19.480] other,
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.100] has
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:20.280] to
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:20.380] do
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:20.520] with
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:20.620] the
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:20.780] kinds
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:20.900] of
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:21.360] considerations
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:21.600] I
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:21.720] was
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:21.880] just
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.200] talking
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:22.480] about.
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:22.660] When
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:22.800] you're
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:22.940] trying
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:23.080] to
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:23.220] figure
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:23.460] out
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:23.900] what's
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:24.020] the
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:24.220] best
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:24.580] theory
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:24.960] of,
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:25.140] for
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:25.440] example,
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.140] what
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:26.600] sequences
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:26.920] of
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:27.280] sounds
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:27.500] are
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:27.860] allowed
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:28.100] in
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:28.240] the
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:28.520] syllable
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.100] in
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:29.200] a
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:29.360] given
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:29.880] language.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.140] Sometimes
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:31.440] it's
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:31.700] useful
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:31.840] to
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:31.960] be
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:32.100] able
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:32.240] to
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:32.480] say,
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:32.940] this
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:33.100] is
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:33.240] a
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:33.480] language
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:33.680] that
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.020] doesn't
[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:34.320] ever,
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:34.600] ever
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.180] allow,
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:35.880] say,
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:36.340] a
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:36.580] syllable
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:36.820] to
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:37.100] end
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:37.260] with
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:37.360] a
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:37.600] stop
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:37.860] followed
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.100] by
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:38.220] a
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:38.500] fricative.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:39.440] Oh,
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:39.580] but
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:39.740] it's
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:39.920] okay
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:40.100] for
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:40.200] it
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:40.280] to
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:40.420] end
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:40.580] with
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:40.780] ch.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:41.940] So
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:42.080] we'll
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:42.220] just
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:42.500] treat
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:42.700] that
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:42.840] as
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:42.980] a
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:43.180] single
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:43.620] package.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:44.020] We
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:44.280] won't
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:44.520] treat
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:44.640] it
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:44.800] as
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:44.920] a
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:45.140] stop
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:45.380] followed
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:45.560] by
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:45.680] a
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:45.880] fricative.
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:46.520] That's
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:46.620] the
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:46.760] kind
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:46.880] of
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.100] move
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:47.340] people
[00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:47.580] want.
[00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:51.450] Terminology.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:55:59.660] So
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:00.280] I've
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:00.400] made
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:00.540] the
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:00.720] table
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.060] wider.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:02.860] There
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:02.960] are
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:03.440] glides,
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:04.200] like
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:04.380] w
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:04.880] and
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.120] y.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:05.920] There
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.000] are
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:06.100] some
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:06.280] other
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:06.620] glides
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:06.960] there,
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.200] which
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:08.380] I
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:08.480] can
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:08.600] try
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:08.700] to
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:08.860] read
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:08.980] to
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.120] you.
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:09.460] What
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:09.580] would
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:09.820] a
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.520] labiodental
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:10.980] glide
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:11.720] sound
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:12.020] like?
[00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.830] What's
[00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:16.910] a
[00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:17.410] labiodental
[00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:17.790] fricative?
[00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:18.630] A
[00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.870] voiced
[00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:19.370] labiodental
[00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:19.770] fricative?
[00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.650] Vuh,
[00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:22.030] right?
[00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.250] Like
[00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:22.370] a
[00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.570] V
[00:56:22.570 --> 00:56:22.930] sound.
[00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:24.170] So
[00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:25.030] can
[00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.170] you
[00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:25.330] try
[00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:25.450] to
[00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:25.590] make
[00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:25.710] a
[00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:26.170] labiodental
[00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:26.590] glide,
[00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:27.070] maybe
[00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:27.410] between
[00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.790] vowels?
[00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:28.570] It's
[00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:28.670] gonna
[00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.790] be
[00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.990] something
[00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.510] like,
[00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:30.250] Allah,
[00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:31.190] Allah,
[00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.670] Allah.
[00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:34.090] English
[00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:34.350] doesn't
[00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:34.490] have
[00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:34.710] those.
[00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.870] I
[00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:35.030] believe
[00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.270] Hindi
[00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.610] does.
[00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:36.270] So
[00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.470] there
[00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.850] are
[00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:37.210] languages
[00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:37.430] out
[00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.550] there
[00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:37.690] that
[00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:37.850] have
[00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:38.290] labiodental
[00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:38.690] glides.
[00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:39.550] Similarly,
[00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:39.890] there
[00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:40.010] are
[00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:40.270] velar
[00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.630] glides,
[00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:41.050] Allah,
[00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:41.730] Allah,
[00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:42.450] Allah,
[00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.930] where
[00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:44.210] your
[00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.790] tongue
[00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:44.930] is
[00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:45.110] just
[00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:45.310] kind
[00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:45.410] of
[00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:45.710] vaguely
[00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:47.110] gesturing
[00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:47.290] in
[00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:47.410] the
[00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:47.750] direction
[00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.950] of
[00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:48.070] your
[00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:48.330] velum.
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:49.600] I
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:49.740] kind
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:49.840] of
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:50.020] like
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:50.200] the
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:50.600] IPA
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:50.900] symbol
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:51.100] for
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:51.220] the
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:51.460] velar
[00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:51.760] glide.
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:52.280] It
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:52.580] looks
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:52.760] like
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:52.980] something
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:53.160] out
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:53.260] of
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:53.540] Tolkien.
[00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:55.450] Yep.
[00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:00.290] All
[00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.750] right.
[00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:01.750] So
[00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:02.310] we've
[00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:02.470] done
[00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:03.090] consonants.
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:04.580] Have
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:04.700] not
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:04.860] done
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:05.000] all
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:05.140] the
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:05.640] consonants.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:06.080] So
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:06.880] what
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:06.960] I'm
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.040] gonna
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:07.180] do
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:07.280] is
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:07.400] show
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:07.540] you
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:07.700] some
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:07.960] vowels,
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:08.540] and
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:08.660] then
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:08.820] we'll
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:09.000] circle
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.280] back
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:09.420] and
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:09.560] look
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:09.660] at
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:09.820] some
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:10.240] particularly
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:10.780] exotic
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.400] consonants,
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:11.740] probably
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:12.060] next
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:12.300] time,
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:12.560] probably
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:12.780] not.
[00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.810] I
[00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:13.970] want
[00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:14.070] to
[00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:14.210] start
[00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.450] talking
[00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.610] about
[00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:14.890] vowels.
[00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:16.030] So
[00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:16.210] let's
[00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:16.330] go
[00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:16.490] through
[00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.610] the
[00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:16.850] vowels
[00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:17.410] systematically.
[00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:19.390] Compare
[00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:20.030] the
[00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.290] vowel
[00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:20.530] in
[00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:20.650] the
[00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:20.810] middle
[00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:21.030] of
[00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.470] bead
[00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:22.050] and
[00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:22.250] the
[00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.490] vowel
[00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:22.710] in
[00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.810] the
[00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:22.970] middle
[00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:23.170] of
[00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:23.670] bad.
[00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:24.470] And
[00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.970] here,
[00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:25.170] let
[00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:25.250] me
[00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.430] just
[00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.670] warn
[00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.890] you
[00:57:25.890 --> 00:57:26.370] that
[00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:26.530] the
[00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:27.250] IPA
[00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:29.190] becomes
[00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.710] particularly
[00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:30.950] forbidding
[00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:31.190] when
[00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.330] we
[00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:31.450] get
[00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:31.630] to
[00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.990] vowels
[00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.370] in
[00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:32.750] English.
[00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:33.890] And
[00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:34.070] it's
[00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:34.250] not
[00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:34.410] the
[00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:34.630] fault
[00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.810] of
[00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:34.950] the
[00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:35.490] IPA.
[00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:36.130] It's
[00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:36.330] the
[00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:36.650] fact
[00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.910] that
[00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:37.190] English
[00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.730] has
[00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:38.210] a
[00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:38.450] very
[00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.970] large
[00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:39.350] number
[00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:39.590] of
[00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:39.910] vowels
[00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:40.770] and
[00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:41.890] not
[00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:42.490] very
[00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:42.710] good
[00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:43.070] system
[00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:43.490] for
[00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:44.270] writing
[00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.610] them.
[00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.130] This
[00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:45.230] is
[00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.430] one
[00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.550] of
[00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:45.590] the
[00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:45.750] things
[00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.870] that
[00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:46.030] makes
[00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:46.330] English
[00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:46.690] spelling
[00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:47.010] so
[00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:47.370] difficult
[00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:47.630] that
[00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.790] we
[00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:48.430] can
[00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.770] actually
[00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:49.050] have
[00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:49.610] competitions
[00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:49.970] where
[00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:50.110] you
[00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:50.390] watch
[00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.690] people
[00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:51.130] spell.
[00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.790] This
[00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:52.050] is
[00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:53.190] the
[00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:53.530] kind
[00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:53.650] of
[00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:53.810] thing
[00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:53.950] that
[00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:54.070] in
[00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:54.270] many
[00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.650] languages
[00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.930] would
[00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:55.070] be
[00:57:55.070 --> 00:57:55.510] impossible.
[00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:56.030] If
[00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:56.150] you
[00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.390] tried
[00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.550] to
[00:57:56.550 --> 00:57:56.670] do
[00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.850] that
[00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:57.010] in
[00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:57.390] Finnish,
[00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:57.930] the
[00:57:57.930 --> 00:57:58.230] spelling
[00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.410] bee
[00:57:58.410 --> 00:57:58.550] would
[00:57:58.550 --> 00:57:58.710] just
[00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.950] never
[00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:59.330] end
[00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:00.130] because
[00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:00.950] every
[00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:01.290] word
[00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:01.770] is
[00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:02.150] pronounced
[00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.610] exactly
[00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:02.750] the
[00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.850] way
[00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:03.010] it's
[00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:03.210] spelled.
[00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.910] We
[00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:04.050] don't
[00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:04.170] do
[00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:04.310] that
[00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:04.410] in
[00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:04.670] English.
[00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:06.170] So
[00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.670] here
[00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.870] are
[00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:07.250] two
[00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.710] vowels,
[00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:08.030] and
[00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.210] those
[00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.310] are
[00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:08.470] their
[00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.910] IPA
[00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:09.350] symbols,
[00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:10.050] the
[00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:10.290] vowel
[00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:10.510] in
[00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.770] bead
[00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:11.030] and
[00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.130] the

[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:40.500] Yes.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:42.920] Yeah,
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:43.060] the
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:43.220] second
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:43.400] vowel
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:43.560] is
[00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:43.720] more
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:44.040] open.
[00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:47.530] You're
[00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:47.770] tongue.
[00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.630] Yeah,
[00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.990] it's

[00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:52.590] It's
[00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:52.750] going
[00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:52.910] from
[00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:53.030] the
[00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.170] top

[00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.850] Yeah,
[00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:54.010] I
[00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:54.130] think
[00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:54.250] you
[00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:54.390] guys
[00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.490] are
[00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:54.650] both
[00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.870] right.
[00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:55.250] So
[00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.430] for
[00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:56.050] ee,
[00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:57.190] your
[00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.450] tongue
[00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:57.670] is

[00:58:57.830 --> 00:58:57.930] of
[00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:58.170] tense
[00:58:58.170 --> 00:58:58.310] and
[00:58:58.310 --> 00:58:58.430] it's
[00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.550] up
[00:58:58.550 --> 00:58:58.670] there
[00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.770] at
[00:58:58.770 --> 00:58:58.850] the
[00:58:58.850 --> 00:58:58.970] top
[00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:59.050] of
[00:58:59.050 --> 00:58:59.110] your
[00:58:59.110 --> 00:58:59.390] mouth.
[00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.890] And
[00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:00.070] then
[00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:00.250] for
[00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:00.730] ah,
[00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:01.730] your
[00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:02.010] tongue
[00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:02.870] drops.
[00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:03.390] In
[00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.630] fact,
[00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.870] drops
[00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:04.050] so
[00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:04.250] far
[00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.430] that
[00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.550] it
[00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:04.870] drags
[00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:05.010] your
[00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:05.230] jaw
[00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.530] down
[00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:05.730] with
[00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:05.890] it.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:06.880] Maybe
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.100] there's
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:07.180] a
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:07.460] more
[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:07.980] reasonable
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.220] way
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:08.340] to
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:08.480] say
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:08.660] that.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:08.840] You
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.180] lower
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:09.400] your
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:09.620] jaw
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:09.840] so
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:09.980] that
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:10.120] your
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:10.320] tongue
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:10.560] can
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:11.180] go
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:11.380] even
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:11.620] further
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:11.960] down.
[00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.750] So
[00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:16.230] one
[00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.410] way
[00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:16.530] of
[00:59:16.530 --> 00:59:17.050] classifying
[00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:17.410] vowels
[00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:18.170] is
[00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:18.350] in
[00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:18.610] terms
[00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:18.790] of
[00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:19.150] height.
[00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:20.770] So
[00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:20.910] we
[00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:21.150] talk
[00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:21.410] about
[00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.610] the
[00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:21.830] high
[00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:22.150] vowel
[00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.490] like
[00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:22.930] heat
[00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:23.770] and
[00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:23.950] the
[00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:24.190] low
[00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:24.570] vowel
[00:59:24.570 --> 00:59:24.930] like
[00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:25.510] hat.
[00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:26.290] And
[00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:26.410] there
[00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:26.510] are
[00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.730] vowels
[00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:26.910] in
[00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:27.210] between,
[00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.610] like
[00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:27.790] the
[00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:28.050] vowel
[00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:28.310] in
[00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:28.790] hate.
[00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.450] That
[00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.650] vowel
[00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:29.830] is
[00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:30.030] called
[00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:30.370] mid.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:31.380] So
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:31.460] we
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:31.500] have
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:31.720] high
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:32.080] vowels
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:32.280] and
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:32.360] we
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:32.480] have
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:32.720] mid
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:33.020] vowels
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:33.260] and
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:33.380] then
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:33.480] we
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:33.600] have
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:33.800] low
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.180] vowels.
[00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.650] Okay,
[00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:43.550] now
[00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:44.830] let's
[00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:44.950] do
[00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:45.190] another
[00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.690] comparison.
[00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.190] Think
[00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.390] about
[00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.530] the
[00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:46.770] vowel
[00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:46.990] in
[00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:47.210] he
[00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:48.150] and
[00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.290] the
[00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:48.530] vowel
[00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:48.870] in
[00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:49.110] who.
[00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:50.650] So
[00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:51.270] everybody
[00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.690] go
[00:59:51.690 --> 00:59:52.470] ee,
[00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:53.050] ooh.
[00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:00.490] What's
[01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:00.790] going
[01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:01.210] on
[01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:01.350] in
[01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:01.490] your
[01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.690] vocal
[01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:02.070] tract
[01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:02.350] as
[01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:02.470] you
[01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.630] do
[01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.990] that?
[01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.930] What's
[01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:10.050] the
[01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:10.270] difference
[01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:10.510] between
[01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.770] ee
[01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:10.930] and
[01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:11.190] ooh?
[01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:13.490] Your
[01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:13.750] lips.
[01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:13.970] Your
[01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:14.130] lips
[01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:14.270] are
[01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.670] definitely
[01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:15.170] involved.
[01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:15.710] Yes.
[01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.270] So
[01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.450] for
[01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:16.990] ooh,
[01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:18.330] your
[01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:19.290] lips
[01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:19.430] are
[01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.750] rounded.
[01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:20.970] For
[01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:21.210] the
[01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:21.430] ooh,
[01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.730] that's
[01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:22.190] absolutely
[01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.510] right.
[01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:23.730] And

[01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:28.610] Five.

[01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:30.310] It
[01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:30.430] does

[01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:30.750] have
[01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.990] five.
[01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:31.130] It

[01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.410] like
[01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:31.850] 14.
[01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:33.790] And,

[01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:34.230] know,
[01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:35.250] why
[01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:36.010] are
[01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:36.190] we
[01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:36.450] taught
[01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:36.650] that
[01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.750] it

[01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:37.250] has
[01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:37.630] five?
[01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.830] Why
[01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:37.970] do
[01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:38.530] we
[01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:38.710] only
[01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.910] have
[01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:39.230] five
[01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.570] letters
[01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:39.950] for
[01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:40.210] vowels?
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:43.660] Who
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:43.880] gave
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.060] us
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:44.280] this
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:44.600] alphabet?
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:46.200] The
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:46.620] Romans,
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:47.260] right?
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:48.040] Yeah.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:48.560] And
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:48.740] in
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:48.980] Latin,
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:49.220] there
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:49.420] in
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:49.620] fact
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:49.840] are
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.160] five
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:50.520] vowels,
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:50.820] which
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:50.960] can
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.100] be
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:51.360] either
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:51.920] long
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.040] or
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:52.260] short.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:52.640] So
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:52.780] this
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:52.900] is
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.020] a
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:53.220] perfect
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:53.540] alphabet
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:53.820] for
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.100] Latin.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.320] But
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:55.580] then
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:55.740] we
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:55.900] got
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:56.060] hold
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:56.160] of
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:56.340] it.
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:57.260] And
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:57.660] so
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:58.920] we've
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.080] ended
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:03:59.360] up
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:03:59.680] with,
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:03:59.880] you
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.040] know,
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:00.440] 12,
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:00.860] 14
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:01.200] vowels,
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:01.480] different
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:01.860] dialects
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:01.920] of
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.100] English
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:02.240] are
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:02.520] different.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:03.680] And
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:03.880] we
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.080] have
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:04.460] five
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:04.720] letters
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:04.900] to
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.040] spell
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:05.200] them
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:05.380] with.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:05.780] And
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:05.900] this
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.000] is
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.120] why
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:06.240] we
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:06.380] have
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:06.680] spelling
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:06.940] bees.
[01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:08.730] One
[01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:08.830] of
[01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:08.890] the
[01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:09.130] reasons.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:10.220] OK,
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:10.540] so
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:10.980] I've
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.160] written
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:11.540] six
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:11.720] of
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.000] our
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:12.500] five
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:12.820] vowels
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:13.440] here
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:13.600] on
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:13.760] this
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.040] chart.
[01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.190] And
[01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.510] then,
[01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.710] but
[01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:17.010] well,
[01:04:17.090 --> 01:04:17.150] we
[01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.290] have
[01:04:17.290 --> 01:04:17.590] more.
[01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:18.030] So
[01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:18.590] think
[01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:18.950] about
[01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:19.890] ooh
[01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:20.250] and
[01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:20.690] ooh,
[01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:21.290] right?
[01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.530] In
[01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:22.110] hood
[01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:22.630] and
[01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:23.050] hood.
[01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:24.290] Or
[01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:24.890] E
[01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:25.230] and
[01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.650] E
[01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:26.250] and
[01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:26.730] heed
[01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:27.030] and
[01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:27.290] heed.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:27.980] Or
[01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:28.540] A
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.000] and
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:29.420] A
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:29.780] in
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:30.280] raid
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:30.480] and
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:30.880] red.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:31.580] Or
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.100] O
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:32.440] and
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:32.840] O
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.260] like
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:33.460] in
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:33.860] coat.
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:36.660] There
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:36.760] are
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.060] various
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:37.260] ways
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:37.400] of
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:37.640] talking
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:37.900] about
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:38.100] this
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:38.560] distinction.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:39.280] But
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.000] one
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:40.320] way
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:40.640] is
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:40.820] like
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:41.040] this.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:41.220] We
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:41.460] say
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:41.660] that
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:41.860] there's
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:41.980] a
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.300] distinction
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:42.660] between
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:42.820] what
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:42.920] are
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.120] called
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:43.540] tense
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:43.920] vowels
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.160] and
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:44.280] what
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:44.380] are
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:44.600] called
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.080] lax
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:45.540] vowels.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.220] So
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.860] ooh
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:49.720] is
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:49.880] a
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.240] high
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:50.680] back
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.300] rounded
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.020] tense
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:52.420] vowel.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:53.000] And
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:53.080] if
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:53.160] you
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:53.260] go
[01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:53.440] back
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:53.580] and
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:53.760] forth
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.140] between
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:54.620] ooh
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:54.920] and
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.380] ooh,
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.100] ooh,
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.400] ooh,
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.060] ooh,
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.160] the
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:00.460] idea
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:00.760] is
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.300] basically
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:01.520] what
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:01.640] you're
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:01.880] doing
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.040] is
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:02.560] relaxing.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:03.860] So
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.160] your
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:04.520] tongue
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:04.760] is
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.000] not
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:05.340] quite
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:05.560] as
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.240] rigidly
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:06.780] high
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:06.960] and
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.240] back
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:07.760] as
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:07.860] it
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:08.000] would
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.160] be
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:08.340] for
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:08.500] an
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:08.740] ooh
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:09.400] when
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:09.520] it
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:09.740] makes
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:09.920] an
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:10.080] ooh.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:10.600] And
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:10.760] your
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:10.960] lips
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.220] are
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:11.740] probably
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:11.980] not
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:12.220] quite
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:12.400] as
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:12.780] tensely
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:13.100] rounded
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:13.420] either.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:13.640] Your
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:13.800] whole
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.020] body
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:14.720] relaxes.
[01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.950] Same
[01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:17.170] deal
[01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:17.330] with
[01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:17.450] all
[01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.650] these
[01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:17.850] other
[01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:18.210] pairs.
[01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:20.290] It's
[01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:20.410] a
[01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:20.770] fact
[01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:21.150] about
[01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:21.450] English
[01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:21.830] lax
[01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:22.170] vowels
[01:05:22.170 --> 01:05:22.530] that
[01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:22.830] there's
[01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:23.070] a
[01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:23.690] restriction
[01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:24.750] on
[01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.870] their
[01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:25.410] distribution.
[01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:26.190] English
[01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.910] monosyllables
[01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:27.310] don't
[01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:27.730] end
[01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:27.990] in
[01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.370] lax
[01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:28.730] vowels
[01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:29.830] that
[01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:29.930] are
[01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:30.090] either
[01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:30.330] front
[01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:30.450] or
[01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:30.670] high.
[01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:31.110] So
[01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:31.270] we
[01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.690] have
[01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:32.190] words
[01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.490] like
[01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:32.810] flee
[01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:33.390] and
[01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.810] flew
[01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:34.250] and
[01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:34.750] flay.
[01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.490] Those
[01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:35.610] are
[01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:35.790] all
[01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:36.130] words
[01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:36.270] in
[01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:36.630] English.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:37.940] Flay
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:38.260] means
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:38.460] to,
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:38.620] you
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:38.700] know,
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.080] remove
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:39.260] the
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:39.460] skin
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:39.720] from.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.160] But
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:41.300] we
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:41.460] don't
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:41.640] have
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.040] those
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:42.460] three
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:42.800] words
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:42.920] at
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.040] the
