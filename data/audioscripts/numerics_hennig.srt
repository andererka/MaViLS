[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.680] can
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.840] actually
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.980] do
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.160] this
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.560] faster
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.800] in
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.080] linear
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.480] time
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.180] in
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.280] the
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.440] size
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.540] of
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.640] the
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.760] data
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.060] set,
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.800] but
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.040] that
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.220] might
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.440] come
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.600] with
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.780] some
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.280] drawbacks
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.960] and
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.060] then
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.180] we'll
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.360] talk
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.540] more
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.720] about
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.860] that
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.040] next
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.320] lecture.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.660] OK,
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.080] so
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.240] now
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.400] that
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.700] we've
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.080] situated
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.400] us,
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.900] please
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.080] during
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.180] the
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.380] lecture
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.500] at
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.660] any
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.860] point
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.980] if
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.040] you
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.140] don't
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.500] understand
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.740] anything,
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.960] just
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.240] ask
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.400] me,
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.860] I'll
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.920] do
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.040] my
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.200] best
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.320] to
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.500] answer,
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.640] and
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.800] with
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.960] that
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.260] let's
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.400] get
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.560] into
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.840] it.
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.760] OK,
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.980] quick
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.440] recap
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.940] about
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.180] Gaussian
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.600] processes,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.380] talked
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.580] about
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.720] them
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.980] last
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.200] week
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.420] a
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.520] little
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.740] bit,
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.720] why
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.840] do
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.100] we
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.300] kind
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.360] of
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.740] focus
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.940] on
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.160] them
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.480] as
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.920] a
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.140] base
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.420] case
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.600] so
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.860] much.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.640] So
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.220] the
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.420] main
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.780] goal
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.640] for
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.960] regression
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.260] is
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.400] we
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.480] are
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.700] trying
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.880] to
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.180] learn
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.400] an
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.660] unknown
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.140] function,
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.380] in
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.500] this
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.680] case
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.860] f
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.200] star,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.880] from
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.960] a
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.140] training
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.280] data
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.440] set
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.540] of
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.940] examples,
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.480] right.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.820] Kind
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.900] of
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.180] a
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.920] basic
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.420] example
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.960] of
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.520] regression,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.380] and
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.640] what
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.700] do
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.820] we
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.140] want
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.320] from
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.500] our
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.800] model
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.980] if
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.060] you
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.160] do
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.520] regression?
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.100] Ideally,
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.200] maybe
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.340] the
[00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.620] most
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.920] important
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.160] thing
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.340] is
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.460] we
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.580] want
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.660] it
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.800] to
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.440] generalize
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.820] to
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.080] data
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.240] that
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.340] we
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.460] do
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.580] not
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.820] have
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.920] in
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.020] our
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.240] training
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.440] data
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.660] set.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.180] But
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.320] there
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.520] might
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.680] be
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.840] some
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.200] other
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.760] goals
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.960] as
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.180] well
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.840] alongside
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.100] this
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.560] generalization
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.840] goal.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.560] So
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.760] second
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.920] of
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.100] all,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.440] we
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.620] might
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.780] want
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.940] our
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.220] model
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.340] to
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.480] be
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.880] sufficiently
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.440] simple
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.080] or
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.660] interpretable
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.280] that
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.360] we
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.500] can
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.720] actually
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.140] understand
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.420] what's
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.620] going
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.820] on
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.060] after
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.400] training,
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.580] what
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.680] the
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.840] model
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.000] has
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.220] actually
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.580] learned.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.560] Then
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.960] third,
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.660] we
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.840] really
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.040] would
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.260] also
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.460] like
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.580] to
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.720] know
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.820] how
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.980] much
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.100] to
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.420] trust
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.580] the
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.880] prediction,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.100] right.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.180] If
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.240] you
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.360] just
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.480] get
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.580] a
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.780] point
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.100] estimate,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.560] we
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.740] might
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.080] be
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.160] not
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.380] actually
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.640] sure
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.820] how
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.960] much
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.060] we
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.200] should
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.520] trust
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.660] in
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.780] that
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.000] point
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.340] estimate.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.560] Is
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.660] that
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.820] a
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.120] good
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.600] prediction
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.080] far
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.340] away
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.580] from
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.740] the
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.960] data?
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.260] And
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.400] then
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.760] finally,
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.240] we
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.420] really
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.560] want
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.660] this
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.720] to
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.840] be
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.160] fast,
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.360] right.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.620] If
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.820] it
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.000] doesn't
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.220] help
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.420] us,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.620] if
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.820] our
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.020] model
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.340] trains
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.720] for,
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.980] let's
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.200] say,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.000] 300
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.540] days,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.020] then
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.200] we
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.440] can't
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.620] use
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.780] that
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.000] really
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.260] well
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.480] in
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.040] practice.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.880] And
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.460] GPs
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.660] are
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.880] really
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.080] kind
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.200] of
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.480] the
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.520] prime
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.980] example
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.160] where
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.260] we
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.400] can
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.740] hit
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.960] all
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.060] of
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.220] these
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.520] points.
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.660] So
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.780] for
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.040] example,
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.160] of
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.280] course
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.360] you
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.460] want
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.960] generalization,
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.200] that's
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.400] just
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.220] what
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.340] we
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.480] need
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.620] for
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.940] regression.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.720] But
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.000] then
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.460] GPs
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.640] in
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.840] some
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.940] way
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.060] are
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.460] simple
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.680] and
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.380] interpretable
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.620] because
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.820] we
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.040] can
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.520] reason
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.820] about
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.100] what
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.280] the
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.560] kernel
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.780] kind
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.840] of
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.300] encodes,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.440] what
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.780] assumptions
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.020] about
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.160] the
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.360] data.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.600] We
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.780] get
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.880] an
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.220] uncertainty
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.640] estimate
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.300] that
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.740] tells
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.000] us
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.200] how
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.340] much
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.420] we
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.540] should
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.800] trust
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.940] the
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.300] prediction
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.680] assuming
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.000] our
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.320] model
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.520] is
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.960] correct.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.540] And
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.680] then
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.100] finally,
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.340] as
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.520] we've
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.680] learned
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.960] last
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.220] week,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.560] it's
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.720] actually
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.900] very
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.320] expensive
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.640] to
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.880] train
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.020] them
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.140] and
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.240] do
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.580] inference,
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.760] right.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.900] So
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.020] what
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.080] do
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.160] we
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.280] do
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.440] about
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.580] that
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.780] last
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.020] point?
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.260] And
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.500] that's
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.620] what
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.120] we'll
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.280] deal
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.460] with
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.680] today.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.700] All
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.820] right.
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.140] So
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.600] just
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.720] as
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.820] a
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.040] reminder,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.880] this
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.960] is
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.100] what
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.240] the
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.440] Gaussian
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.820] process
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.180] posterior
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.580] looks
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.940] like
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.920] in
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.080] the
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.340] mean.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.380] We
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.540] have
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.740] kind
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.860] of
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.400] an
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.700] error
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.980] term
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.280] between
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.460] the
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.800] data
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.360] and
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.600] our
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.200] prior
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.500] mean,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.700] our
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.880] prior
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.220] prediction
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.620] that
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.900] gets
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.340] scaled
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.100] by
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.320] the
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.600] inverse
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.760] of
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.900] the
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.120] gram
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.540] matrix.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.080] You
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.200] can
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.400] think
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.500] of
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.640] that
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.880] as
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.560] how
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.200] strict
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.360] should
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.460] I
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.760] interpret
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.980] this
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.240] error.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.520] So
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.680] if
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.820] my
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.300] uncertainty,
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.740] my
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.000] prior
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.320] uncertainty
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.460] is
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.620] very
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.020] large,
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.960] maybe
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.300] it's
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.580] fine
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.880] if
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.260] I'm
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.460] far
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.700] away
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.920] from
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.040] the
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.180] true
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.420] data,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.920] right.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.820] But
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.940] if
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.260] my
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.040] uncertainty
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.180] is
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.320] actually
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.520] very
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.060] concentrated,
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.380] I
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.540] should
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.740] make
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.880] a
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.040] big
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.440] update
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.540] to
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.380] be
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.660] closer
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.880] to
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.060] the
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.720] training
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.920] data.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.860] And
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.000] then
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.580] the
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.100] covariance
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.040] evaluated
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.260] at
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.620] data
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.960] points
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.960] also
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.320] involves
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.540] this
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.920] inversion
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.100] of
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.220] a
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.520] matrix
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.860] of
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.940] the
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.140] size
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.240] of
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.340] the
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.480] data
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.700] set.
[00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.230] Now
[00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.650] really,
[00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.910] GP
[00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.070] regression
[00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.410] actually
[00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.550] is
[00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.730] two
[00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.990] parts,
[00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.130] right.
[00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.250] It's
[00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.450] not
[00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.730] just
[00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.030] computing
[00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.150] the
[00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.370] posterior.
[00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.090] We
[00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.230] also
[00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.370] need
[00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.490] to
[00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.710] find
[00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.870] the
[00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.090] kernel
[00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.750] hyperparameters.
[00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:48.130] So
[00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.710] do
[00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.990] model
[00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.430] selection
[00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.630] in
[00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.710] a
[00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.870] way.
[00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.830] So
[00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.990] this
[00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.110] would
[00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.230] be
[00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.530] your
[00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.330] training
[00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.610] loop
[00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.890] during
[00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.110] deep
[00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.370] learning,
[00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.530] for
[00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.850] example.
[00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.190] And
[00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.470] the
[00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.810] loss
[00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.250] that
[00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.530] we
[00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.330] optimize
[00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.550] for
[00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.010] GPs
[00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.310] is
[00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.690] the

[00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.430] marginal
[00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.810] likelihood.
[00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.490] So
[00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.530] given
[00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.570] this
[00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.070] kernel
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.640] hyperparameter
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.780] or
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.940] these
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.160] kernel
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.820] hyperparameters,
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.240] how
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.580] likely
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.840] is
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.360] it
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.480] that
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.600] the

[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.620] from
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.800] this
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.040] model?
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.020] And
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.060] you
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.140] can
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.300] see
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.600] that
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.040] if

[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.480] We

[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.980] So

[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.000] we
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.360] evaluate
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.660] at
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.960] here
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.200] and

[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.680] points.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.000] And
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.140] then
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.320] for

[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.580] We
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.740] just
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.960] saw

[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.500] And
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.660] then
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.760] we
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.920] also
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.080] need

[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.400] Is
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.580] this
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.400] great,

[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.080] Does

[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.860] Here's
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.080] an
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.360] illustration
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.600] of
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.860] that.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.400] On
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.560] the
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.720] left,
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.880] we
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.940] have
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.060] a

[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.780] I
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.960] believe
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.120] this
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.260] is
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.460] a

[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.020] And
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.260] you
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.360] get
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.560] these

[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.400] and

[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.040] transposed.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.100] Now,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.800] just
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.940] as
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.080] a
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.340] quick

[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.280] right?
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.840] This
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.920] is
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.020] a

[00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.220] the
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.460] data
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.640] is
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.000] actually,
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.620] you
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.740] can
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.960] order
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.140] the
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.400] data
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.820] just
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.120] from

[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.320] But

[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:40.740] You're
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:40.840] not
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:40.920] going
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.940] to
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:41.040] be
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.200] able
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.380] to
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:41.780] form
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:41.980] even
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.400] form
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.560] that
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:42.780] kernel
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.180] matrix
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.400] in
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.720] memory,
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.160] because
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.260] it
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.420] takes
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:44.660] about
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:44.900] 80
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.200] gigabytes.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.600] So,
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.040] maybe
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.180] you
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.280] have
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.420] a
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:48.600] very,
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:48.820] very
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.120] big
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.420] machine
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:49.600] with
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.700] a
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:49.780] lot
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:49.920] of
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.140] RAM,
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:50.880] and
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:50.980] you
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.120] have
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.340] 80
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:51.600] gigabytes
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:51.780] of
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.000] RAM,
[00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.390] then
[00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.930] you'll
[00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.290] probably
[00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.530] still
[00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:54.750] face
[00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:54.930] this
[00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.250] problem.
[00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:56.590] A
[00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:56.810] modern
[00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.550] CPU,
[00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:58.050] excuse
[00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.250] me,
[00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:58.610] has
[00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.850] about
[00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.730] one
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.140] gigaflop

[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.120] second,
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.500] so
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.400] 10
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:06.480] to
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:06.620] the

[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.020] per

[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.320] If
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.500] we
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.020] plug
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.160] that

[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.320] of
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:13.680] operations
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:13.900] we
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.040] need
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.160] for
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.280] the

[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.400] one
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:15.560] over
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.200] three

[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.120] n
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.460] cubed,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:17.620] right,
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:17.800] that's
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:17.880] the

[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.100] of

[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:18.620] set,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.560] it'll
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:19.740] take
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:19.840] you
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.180] about
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.120] 83
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.560] hours
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.020] to
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.160] do
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.500] that
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.180] modulo
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.660] overhead,
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:24.540] okay?
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.480] That's
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:25.740] kind
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:25.820] of
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:25.980] not
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.380] acceptable.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.100] Later
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.200] in
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.300] the
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.540] lecture,
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:28.700] I'll
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:28.920] show
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.220] you
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:29.780] what
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:29.880] I
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:29.960] did
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.140] this
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:30.460] morning,
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.020] you
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.140] can
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:31.240] do
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:31.400] this
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:31.500] in
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:31.660] seven
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:31.780] and
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:31.800] a

[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.180] to
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:33.520] desirable

[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.120] Okay,
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.420] so
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:35.900] clearly,
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:36.220] the

[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.940] is

[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.140] both
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.280] in

[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.020] sets
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.200] that
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.300] we
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:41.440] might
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:41.620] care
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:41.880] about.
[00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.570] What
[00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:43.670] can
[00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.730] we
[00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.830] do
[00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.110] instead?
[00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:45.370] We'll
[00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:45.510] talk
[00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:45.690] about

[00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.630] today,
[00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.030] and
[00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.150] we'll
[00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.310] try
[00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.430] to
[00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.670] reduce
[00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.790] the

[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:50.640] in

[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.360] points.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.520] You've
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:53.720] already
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:53.960] seen

[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:57.700] I
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:57.980] only
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.440] show

[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:05.740] gives

[00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.210] regression,
[00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.490] right?
[00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.270] We
[00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:18.330] need
[00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:18.450] an
[00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:18.770] approximation
[00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:19.030] to

[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:22.940] So
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.120] is

[00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.010] as

[00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.210] Can

[00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:39.090] Can

[00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:04.690] Let's
[00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:04.790] take
[00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.370] a

[00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.570] that

[00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.310] So
[00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.470] just
[00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.590] as
[00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.690] a

[00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.870] in
[00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.990] our

[00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:15.390] that's
[00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:15.530] just
[00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.810] a

[00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:19.330] And
[00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:19.510] we
[00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:19.630] get
[00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.770] out
[00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:19.890] a

[00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:21.650] and
[00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.770] if
[00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:21.910] we
[00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.230] stop
[00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.330] it
[00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:22.550] after

[00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:23.170] iterations,
[00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.030] that
[00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.330] only
[00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:24.610] has
[00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:24.890] i
[00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.310] columns
[00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.570] that
[00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:25.690] are
[00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:25.910] non

[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.260] And
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:28.400] then
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:28.520] we
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:28.600] get
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:28.700] an

[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:30.580] So
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.340] what
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:31.640] happens
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:31.840] here?
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.200] So
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.440] really,
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:32.640] there's
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:32.840] only
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.340] two

[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:34.200] kind
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.360] of.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.500] Down
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:35.940] here,
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.200] A
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.580] prime
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:37.980] is

[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.200] of
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.380] like
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:38.520] the

[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:39.340] the

[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:39.680] of
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:39.800] the

[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.260] matrix
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:40.400] that
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:40.500] we
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:40.760] haven't
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.120] learned.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.040] You
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.140] can
[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:42.280] see
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:42.460] that
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:42.780] by,
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:43.700] you
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:43.820] can
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.340] reformulate
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:44.520] that
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:44.700] as
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.000] just
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.440] A
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:45.940] minus
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.860] the
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.320] current
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:47.760] approximation
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.040] of
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.140] the

[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.320] Li
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:49.540] times
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:49.760] Li
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.000] transpose.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:50.560] So
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:50.680] this
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:50.780] is
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:50.880] kind

[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.120] residual,
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:52.480] let's
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:52.660] call
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:52.780] it.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.100] And
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:54.200] then
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:54.340] there's
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.420] a
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:54.560] second
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:54.720] thing
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:54.900] going
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.500] on,
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.100] where,
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.200] as
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.420] Marvin
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:57.700] developed
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:57.980] last
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.240] week,
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:10:59.420] this
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:10:59.620] step
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:10:59.960] here,
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:00.560] you
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:00.700] can
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.000] interpret
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.420] as
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.420] multiplying
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:02.720] this
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.440] residual
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.040] with

[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.480] in
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:05.580] this
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:05.700] case
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:05.840] the

[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:06.480] up
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:06.600] to
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:06.940] scaling,
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:07.760] that
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.260] selects
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:08.340] a

[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:09.600] matrix,
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:09.780] that
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:09.980] just
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.300] selects
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:10.420] a

[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:10.820] of
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:10.920] the
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.200] matrix.
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.160] And
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.420] depending
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:12.760] on
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.120] how
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.240] you
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:13.520] choose
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:13.800] these,
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.040] you
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.180] might
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:14.300] get
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:14.460] a
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:14.780] worse
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:14.960] or
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.320] better
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.380] approximation
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:16.900] after

[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:17.940] iterations
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.780] less
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:18.940] than

[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:20.900] OK,
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.420] now
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.460] can

[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.280] algorithm
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:24.580] by
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:24.900] tracking
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.080] a

[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.260] to
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:26.420] also
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:26.580] get

[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:27.660] of
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:27.840] this?
[00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:30.270] First,
[00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.810] our
[00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:30.970] goal
[00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:31.150] is
[00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.310] to
[00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.710] develop,
[00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:32.110] or
[00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.250] to
[00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:32.510] find
[00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:32.710] such
[00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.830] a

[00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:33.530] an
[00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.750] inverse
[00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.150] approximation.
[00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:35.930] And
[00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.110] we
[00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.330] know
[00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:36.510] we
[00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:36.710] have
[00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.950] this
[00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:37.290] matrix
[00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:37.830] approximation

[00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.810] Can
[00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:40.950] we
[00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:41.350] somehow
[00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.770] wrangle
[00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.010] our
[00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:43.430] algorithm
[00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.770] to
[00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:44.010] also
[00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:44.210] get
[00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.310] an
[00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.490] inverse
[00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:44.850] approximation?
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:46.640] And
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.080] what
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.180] we
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.300] could
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:47.480] do,
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:47.640] for
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:47.920] example,
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:48.240] if
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.320] I
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.460] just
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:48.680] take
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.240] this
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.300] equation,
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.080] and
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.200] I
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.500] multiply
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:51.720] from
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:51.880] the
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.020] left
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.160] and
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.340] right
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:52.520] with
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:52.680] A
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:52.940] inverse,
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.260] then
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:54.780] obviously
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:54.920] on
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.040] the
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:55.240] right
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.140] side,
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:56.220] I
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:56.360] have
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:56.500] A
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:56.720] inverse
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:56.920] here.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.860] And
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.000] on
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.140] the
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.360] left
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:58.660] side,
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:58.920] I
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.100] have
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.300] my
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:11:59.680] Cholesky
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.240] factors
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.320] that
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:03.820] I
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.120] multiply
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.880] from
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.060] the
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.320] left
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.540] with
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:05.720] A
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:05.920] inverse.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.360] Now
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.540] that
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:07.980] didn't
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.160] really
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.320] get
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:08.440] me
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:08.660] much,
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.020] because
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.320] I'm
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:09.560] trying
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:09.760] to
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.200] solve,
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:10.660] or
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:10.760] I'm
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:10.960] trying
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.160] to
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.540] invert
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.380] the
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:12.600] matrix
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:12.940] A.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:13.280] So
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:13.800] to
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.300] get
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:14.400] an
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:14.920] approximation
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.300] for
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:15.420] the
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:15.660] inverse,
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:15.840] I
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:15.940] need
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.060] the
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.220] inverse
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:16.600] itself.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:16.820] That
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.220] doesn't
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:17.380] really
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:17.540] solve
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:17.680] the
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:17.960] problem.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:18.820] But
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.140] let's
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.260] see
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:19.460] what
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:19.700] actually
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:19.940] the
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.300] entries
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:20.460] of
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:20.620] this
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:20.820] matrix
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.040] look
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.260] like.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:22.860] So
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.220] clearly,
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:23.500] the
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:23.760] Ci
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:23.980] is
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.160] actually
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.300] a
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:24.460] low
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:24.620] rank
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:24.980] matrix,
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.200] right?
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.420] Because
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:25.820] Li
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.000] and
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.380] Li
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.040] transpose
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.500] are
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:27.880] both,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.220] only
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:28.380] have

[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.180] columns.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.060] And
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:31.200] the
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.440] last
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:31.800] column
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.740] is
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:32.960] just
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.160] A

[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:35.420] that
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:35.540] we
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.040] constructed
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.200] in
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:37.380] step
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:37.820] 7.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.600] And
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:38.720] we
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:38.880] just
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.160] put
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.340] into

[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.400] Okay?
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.700] So
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:43.900] if
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.200] I
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.600] just
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.040] evaluate,
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:45.340] or
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:45.640] just
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.220] plug
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:47.460] in

[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:52.720] remember
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:52.960] A
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.180] prime
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.320] is

[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.240] the
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:54.460] thing
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:54.580] that
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:54.700] we
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:54.900] haven't
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.120] learned
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.320] about
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.580] A.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:58.880] And
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.360] I
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:12:59.960] plug
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.100] in
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.240] my

[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:00.960] for
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.080] the
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.380] residual,
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:01.660] right?
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.240] That's
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:02.680] the
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.120] matrix
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.540] itself
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:03.900] minus
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.140] the
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:04.320] part
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:04.440] that
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:04.620] I've
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:04.840] learned
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:04.940] in
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.040] the
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.280] last
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.620] iteration.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.480] And
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:07.580] then
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:07.720] I
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.120] multiply
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.460] A

[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:09.160] into
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.480] this.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:09.880] So
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:09.980] I
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.120] get
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.340] an

[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:10.840] matrix
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.240] here,
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:11.620] that's
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:11.680] what
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:11.740] you
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:11.840] can
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:11.980] see
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.320] here.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:13.480] And
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:13.580] then
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:13.660] I
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:13.820] get
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.120] A
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.440] inverse
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:14.840] times
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.260] Li
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:15.580] minus
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:15.920] 1.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.500] And
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:17.600] then
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:17.680] I
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:17.800] can
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.200] also
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:18.580] just
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.000] introduce
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.320] an
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:19.700] identity
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:19.980] matrix
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.120] on
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.240] the

[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:20.540]-hand
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:20.820] side
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.180] by
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:21.800] adding
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.140] A
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:22.340] inverse
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:22.620] times
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:22.940] A.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:23.920] Okay?
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:24.680] And
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:24.800] now
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:24.920] what
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.040] I
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.220] have
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:25.320] in
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:25.580] here
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:25.840] is
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.040] just
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.280] A
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.540] inverse
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:26.840] times
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.160] Li
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:27.400] minus
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:27.800] 1
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.820] times
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.520] A
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:29.760] inverse
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:29.980] times
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.360] Li
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:30.740] minus
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.040] 1
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.620] transposed.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:32.620] But
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:32.840] that's
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.140] just
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.240] the
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.460] inverse
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:34.880] approximation
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.140] from

[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:35.740] iteration.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.200] So
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:37.540] now
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.260] I've
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:38.620] reduced
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:38.860] this
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.180] last
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:39.660] column
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.340] of
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.000] this
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.500] Cholesky
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:42.760] factor
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.080] to
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.340] something
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:43.520] that
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:43.640] I
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:43.980] computed
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.120] in

[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:44.760] iteration.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:45.820] So
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:45.920] I
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.040] can
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.660] recursively
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:46.960] also
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.620] construct
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.360] the

[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.580] And
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:49.700] that
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:49.900] inverse
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.240] approximation
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:50.500] is
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:50.700] actually
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:50.980] also
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.200] low
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.480] rank
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.720] in
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:52.880] the
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.080] same
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.400] way
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.800] that
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:53.900] I
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.400] construct
[00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:55.100] the

[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:56.640] matrix
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:56.900] A.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:58.240] Okay?
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:58.340] So
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:58.600] really
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:58.760] the
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.080] Cholesky
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.240] is
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.520] actually
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.740] also
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.980] an
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.360] approximate
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:02.720] matrix
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.020] inversion
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.400] algorithm.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:05.820] Okay.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:06.420] So
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.060] now
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:07.380] I
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:07.640] added

[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:10.660] what
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:10.780] we
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:10.920] need
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.020] to
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.440] track
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:11.840] to
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.160] compute
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:12.500] this
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:12.900] inverse
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.300] approximation
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:13.600] as
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:13.820] well.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:14.720] So
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:14.900] first
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.020] of
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:15.220] all,
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.060] we
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:16.620] select
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.060] a
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:17.580] unit
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:17.860] vector
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.120] that
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.540] corresponds
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:18.780] to
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.120] selecting
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.280] a
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:19.420] data
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:19.680] point
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:19.820] if
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.880] A
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.280] is
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:21.360] a
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:21.500] kernel
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:21.880] matrix.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.380] And
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:22.520] let's
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:22.660] call
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:22.820] that
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.160] action.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.320] Then
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:25.840] I
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.480] do
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:27.580] a
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:27.660] bunch
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:27.740] of
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.060] stuff.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:28.360] And
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:28.540] let's
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:28.780] focus
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:28.980] on
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.120] the
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.340] bottom
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:29.600] party
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:29.960] first.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:30.920] So
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.200] you've
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.420] seen
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:31.780] that
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.940] here
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.100] we
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.360] update
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:33.540] the

[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.180] residual.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:34.840] And
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.020] now
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.180] I
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:35.400] found
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:35.560] a
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:35.860] way
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.800] to
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.800] also
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.080] compute
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.340] this

[00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:44.330] to
[00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:44.470] the

[00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.090] Ci.
[00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.830] Okay?
[00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:47.170] And
[00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:47.310] by
[00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.650] definition
[00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:47.850] of
[00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:48.150] Ci,
[00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:48.690] we
[00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.150] said
[00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.270] it
[00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:49.570] was
[00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:49.950] A
[00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.150] inverse
[00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.350] times

[00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.750] inverse
[00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.910] times
[00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.110] Li
[00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.630] transposed.
[00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:53.630] I
[00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:53.790] can
[00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.130] rewrite
[00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:54.370] this
[00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:54.710] update

[00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:56.450] And
[00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:56.550] what
[00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.710] we'll
[00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.010] find

[00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.970] if
[00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:59.190] I
[00:14:59.190 --> 00:14:59.490] just
[00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.550] take

[00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.510] I
[00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:03.650] just
[00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:04.010] get

[00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:06.930] A.
[00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.710] So
[00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.950] in
[00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:08.290] here
[00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.390] is

[00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.170] In
[00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.430] here
[00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.690] I

[00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:23.150] So

[00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:26.450] And

[00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:51.510] the
[00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:51.670] unit
[00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.890] vector
[00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:52.090] Ei.
[00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.550] So
[00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.870] that's
[00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:53.310] the
[00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:53.910] observation
[00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:54.310] that
[00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.430] you
[00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.930] previously
[00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:55.270] did
[00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:55.510] in
[00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:55.870] Cholesky.
[00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:56.070] Let's
[00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:56.270] take
[00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:56.370] a
[00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:56.490] step
[00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:56.770] back.
[00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:57.570] That's
[00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:57.750] this,
[00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.930] right?
[00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:58.450] Residual
[00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:58.750] times
[00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:58.970] Ei.
[00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:02.590] Question?
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.020] Sure.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:10.500] So
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:10.940] for
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.160] us,
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:11.520] sorry,
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:11.900] for
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.060] us
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.420] residual
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:12.840] is
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.620] the
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:13.860] thing
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.000] that
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.100] we
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.280] care
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:14.600] about
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.120] minus
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.940] our
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:16.280] approximation.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:22.620] All
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:22.740] right.
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:23.060] So
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.320] we
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:23.460] have
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:23.600] a
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:23.900] way
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.940] to
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.880] modify
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.100] our
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:27.340] action
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:27.500] to
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:27.660] get
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.000] some
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.460] vector
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:28.700] D.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:28.920] And
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.020] it
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.220] turns
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:29.380] out
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:29.520] that
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:29.720] this
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:29.980] inverse
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.440] approximation
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:30.760] is
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.100] just
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.740] at
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:31.960] each
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.360] iteration
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:32.680] I
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:32.860] add
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:32.980] an
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.180] outer
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:33.520] product
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:33.700] of
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:33.820] these
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.080] vectors
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:34.340] Di.
[00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:36.330] OK.
[00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:37.290] And
[00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:37.390] we
[00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:37.530] see
[00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:37.650] that
[00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:37.830] down
[00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.010] here
[00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:38.150] as
[00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.350] well,
[00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:38.610] right?
[00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:38.690] Right
[00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:38.950] now,
[00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:41.390] this
[00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.110] I
[00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.390] minus
[00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:42.610] Ci
[00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:42.890] minus
[00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:43.070] 1
[00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:43.290] times

[00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.890] times
[00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:44.190] Ei
[00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:44.450] just
[00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:44.590] gets
[00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.910] replaced
[00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.110] by
[00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.230] the
[00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.450] vector
[00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:45.710] Di.
[00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.750] And
[00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:46.890] let's
[00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:47.010] do
[00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:47.130] a
[00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:47.390] quick
[00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.390] complexity
[00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:48.830] analysis.
[00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:49.470] Is
[00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.570] that
[00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:49.750] actually
[00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:49.910] more
[00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:50.290] expensive
[00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:50.530] than
[00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:50.710] doing
[00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.850] the
[00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.190] Cholesky
[00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:51.370] by
[00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:51.730] itself?
[00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:52.510] We
[00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:52.670] know
[00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.790] that
[00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.910] the
[00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.290] Cholesky
[00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:53.750] per
[00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.110] iteration
[00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.850] takes
[00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:55.670] O
[00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.730] of
[00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.870] n
[00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:56.150] squared.
[00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:57.330] And
[00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:57.410] let's
[00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:57.510] take
[00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:57.610] a
[00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:57.710] look
[00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.810] at
[00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:58.250] the
[00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:58.630] actions,
[00:16:58.950 --> 00:16:58.990] at
[00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.290] the
[00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.570] computations
[00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:00.710] that
[00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.810] we
[00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:01.050] added.
[00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.150] OK.
[00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:02.390] So
[00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:02.810] here
[00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.390] we
[00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.770] have
[00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:05.710] a
[00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.930] matrix
[00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:06.130] vector
[00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:06.610] multiplication
[00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:07.090] and
[00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:07.270] another
[00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.530] matrix
[00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:07.710] vector
[00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.150] multiplication
[00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.530] that's
[00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:08.630] still
[00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.830] n
[00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:09.110] squared.
[00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:09.990] In
[00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.210] this
[00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:10.650] Ei
[00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:11.270] normalization
[00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.670] constant
[00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.090] step,
[00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.550] we
[00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:12.730] also
[00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:12.930] just
[00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:13.070] do
[00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:13.310] matrix
[00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:13.490] vector
[00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.950] multiplication.
[00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.070] And
[00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:15.230] then
[00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.490] down
[00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:15.870] here,
[00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:16.730] this
[00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.830] is
[00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:16.950] a

[00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.290] rank
[00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:17.650] matrix.
[00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:19.130] So
[00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.570] we
[00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:19.670] can
[00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:19.810] actually
[00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:20.010] just
[00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:20.370] track
[00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:20.690] the
[00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:20.850] low
[00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:20.990] rank
[00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.470] factors
[00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.750] by
[00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.510] storing
[00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.730] the
[00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.290] Di's.
[00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:23.670] Or
[00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.110] even
[00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.310] if
[00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:24.570] we
[00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:25.510] multiply
[00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.730] this
[00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.950] out,
[00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:26.090] this
[00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.190] is
[00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:26.290] an
[00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:26.430] outer
[00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:26.790] product,
[00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.090] this
[00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:27.190] is
[00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:27.310] also
[00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:27.530] just
[00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.690] O
[00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:27.770] of
[00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.870] n
[00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:28.070] squared.
[00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.930] OK.
[00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.230] So
[00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.450] per
[00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.830] iteration,
[00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.470] you
[00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.610] just
[00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:30.950] pay
[00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:31.210] n
[00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:31.550] squared
[00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.370] to
[00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:32.530] do
[00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:32.850] this.
[00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.590] So
[00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.770] asymptotically,
[00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.970] it's
[00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:35.170] just
[00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:35.290] as
[00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:35.710] expensive
[00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:36.550] as
[00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:36.690] if
[00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:36.810] we
[00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:37.170] just
[00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.330] approximated
[00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.530] the
[00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:38.810] matrix
[00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.170] itself.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.020] All
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.140] right.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.180] Let's
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.280] take
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:43.380] a
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:43.500] look
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:43.580] at
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:43.700] what
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:43.840] this
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.020] looks
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:44.180] like
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:44.300] if
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:44.380] you
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:44.620] apply
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:44.780] it
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:44.960] to
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.360] Gaussian
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:45.640] process
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.020] regression.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.080] So
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.480] remember,
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:49.600] for
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.320] just
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:50.540] computing
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:50.660] the
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:50.960] posterior,
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:51.860] we
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:52.080] need
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:52.280] these
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:52.560] two
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:52.900] matrix
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.340] inverses
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:53.520] of
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:53.640] the
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:53.880] kernel
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:54.940] matrix,
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:55.680] size
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:55.880] n
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.020] by
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:56.280] n.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.280] Now
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:58.400] we
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:58.500] have
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:58.580] an
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:58.900] approximation
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.200] to
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.340] this
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:17:59.560] inverse.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.080] So
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.220] what
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:00.680] happens
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.120] if
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.200] you
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.360] just
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:01.780] replace
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.100] that
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:02.500] with
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:02.740] this
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.040] inverse
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.500] approximation?
[00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.430] We
[00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.510] get
[00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.810] this.
[00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:06.130] So
[00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:06.270] this
[00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.390] is
[00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.650] three
[00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.050] iterations
[00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:07.430] of
[00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.570] the
[00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:07.830] partial
[00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:08.250] Cholesky.
[00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.710] Partial
[00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.950] because
[00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:09.110] we
[00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.450] don't
[00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:09.750] run
[00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.850] it
[00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:09.990] to
[00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.110] convergence.
[00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.970] And
[00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:13.470] the
[00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.730] data
[00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.950] points
[00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.050] that
[00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:14.130] we
[00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:14.490] selected,
[00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:14.790] or
[00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.030] the
[00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.230] unit
[00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.690] vectors
[00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.210] for
[00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:16.370] our
[00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.810] actions,
[00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.490] are
[00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:17.710] just
[00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.030] selecting
[00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:18.410] the
[00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.250] data
[00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.550] points
[00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:19.790] in
[00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:19.970] blue
[00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:20.250] here.
[00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:20.530] So
[00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:20.730] in
[00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:21.030] sequence,
[00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:21.330] from
[00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:21.470] the
[00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.610] left
[00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:21.770] to
[00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.910] right,
[00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:22.050] the
[00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.230] first
[00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.410] three.
[00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:23.530] Now
[00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:23.910] clearly,
[00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:25.530] not
[00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:25.670] the
[00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:25.930] greatest
[00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:26.450] approximation,
[00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:26.870] right?
[00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.750] Basically,
[00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:28.130] back
[00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.530] here,
[00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:29.050] we
[00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:29.130] haven't
[00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:29.350] learned
[00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.750] anything
[00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.150] about
[00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:30.290] the
[00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:30.430] true
[00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.730] function
[00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:30.890] in
[00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:31.030] gray
[00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:31.410] dashed.
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.140] Now
[00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.990] you
[00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.130] might
[00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:36.430] notice
[00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.830] also
[00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:37.610] that
[00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.770] this
[00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.030] kind
[00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:38.110] of
[00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.270] looks
[00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.470] like
[00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.690] GPU
[00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:39.070] regression
[00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.890] if
[00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:40.010] you
[00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.250] only
[00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.130] did
[00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:41.370] GPU
[00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:41.650] regression
[00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:41.810] on
[00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.910] the
[00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:42.070] first
[00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.250] three
[00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:42.450] data
[00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:42.730] points.
[00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:45.570] And
[00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:45.750] in
[00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.030] fact,
[00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:47.350] doing
[00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.490] the
[00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:47.650] partial
[00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:48.070] Cholesky
[00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.510] with
[00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.770] no
[00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.150] noise
[00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.930] is
[00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:51.390] equivalent
[00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.610] to
[00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:51.810] GPU
[00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:52.170] regression.
[00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.750] And
[00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.950] you're
[00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:54.330] selecting
[00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:54.530] the
[00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:54.730] data
[00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:55.070] points
[00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.350] that
[00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.650] your
[00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.030] pivoting
[00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:56.390] strategy
[00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.790] selects,
[00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:56.850] so
[00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:56.990] your
[00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.170] unit
[00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:57.550] vectors.
[00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:58.570] And
[00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:58.670] if
[00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:58.730] you
[00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.890] add
[00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.150] noise,
[00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.390] it's
[00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.670] almost
[00:18:59.670 --> 00:18:59.850] the
[00:18:59.850 --> 00:18:59.970] same,
[00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:00.130] not
[00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:00.410] quite.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:02.680] So
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:02.760] you
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:02.880] can
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.100] think
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:03.200] of
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:03.320] the
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:03.500] partial
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:03.920] Cholesky
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.100] as
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:04.380] something
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:04.800] like
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.300] doing
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:05.520] GPU
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:05.940] regression,
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:06.720] but
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.160] conditioning
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:07.560] only
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:07.740] on
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:07.840] a
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:07.960] few
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.140] data
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:08.380] points.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.440] So
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:12.840] last
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.000] time,
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.100] we
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:13.260] already
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:13.600] saw
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:13.800] that
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:13.920] it
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.160] really
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:14.700] matters
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.980] what
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:16.420] pivots
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:16.560] you
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:16.940] choose,
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:17.380] or
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:17.720] in
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:17.920] other
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.360] language,
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:18.700] what
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:18.920] unit
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.260] vectors
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:19.400] you
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:19.600] choose,
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:19.780] what
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:19.980] data
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:20.200] points
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:20.320] you
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:20.600] select.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:20.920] It's
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.080] just
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:21.300] all
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.120] different
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.600] names
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:24.740] for
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:24.840] the
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.000] same
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.300] thing.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.060] And
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:26.980] it
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:27.160] turns
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.380] out

[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.200] here,
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.400] that's
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:30.560] also
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:30.740] the
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.040] case.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:31.580] So
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.760] on
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:32.920] the
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.180] left,
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:34.300] I

[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:36.700] this

[00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:43.010] I
[00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.410] chose
[00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:43.890] those
[00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:44.250] actions
[00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:44.410] that
[00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:44.850] selected
[00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.510] the
[00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.730] first
[00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:45.990] 10
[00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.190] data
[00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.430] points

[00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:47.030] here.
[00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:47.910] And
[00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:47.990] you
[00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.070] can
[00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.250] see
[00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:48.510] that
[00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.870] in
[00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:49.050] this
[00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:49.370] region,
[00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.590] my
[00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.870] real

[00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.790] learned
[00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:50.970] the

[00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:56.930] All
[00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:57.050] the

[00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:57.370] over
[00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:57.710] here,
[00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:58.110] we
[00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.310] essentially
[00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.470] have
[00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.690] learned
[00:19:58.690 --> 00:19:59.210] nothing
[00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.930] about
[00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:00.090] the

[00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:00.810] that
[00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:00.950] we're
[00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.230] trying
[00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.670] to
[00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:02.150] approximate.
[00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.910] Now,
[00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:04.470] on
[00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.610] the
[00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.870] right,
[00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.490] I
[00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:05.730] just
[00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.030] chose
[00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:06.190] a

[00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:07.730] actions.
[00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:08.050] So
[00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:08.270] a
[00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.410] random
[00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:08.830] selection

[00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:10.170] I
[00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:11.190] consider
[00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.390] a

[00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.510] look
[00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.650] at
[00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:14.770] in

[00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.830] And
[00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:16.910] you
[00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:16.990] can
[00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.110] see
[00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.210] that
[00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.310] this
[00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.450] looks
[00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.610] much
[00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:17.810] better,
[00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:18.110] right?
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:18.990] The
[00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.670] posterior
[00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:19.890] is
[00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.070] much
[00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.350] closer
[00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.470] to

[00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.490] lines.
[00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.730] And
[00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.190] also,
[00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.050] we
[00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:25.170] can
[00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:25.470] imagine
[00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.770] that
[00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:26.050] we've
[00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:26.250] learned
[00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:26.430] quite
[00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.530] a
[00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:26.630] lot
[00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.830] more
[00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.010] about
[00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.170] the
[00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:27.470] function,
[00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.710] and
[00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.810] we're
[00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.010] much
[00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.170] more
[00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:28.530] certain
[00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:28.770] about

[00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:29.070] it
[00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.290] is.
[00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.450] So
[00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:31.910] this
[00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:32.190] choice
[00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.330] of
[00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.490] data
[00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:32.870] points
[00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:33.310] not
[00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.530] only
[00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:33.930] matters
[00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:34.210] for
[00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:34.830] approximating
[00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.030] the

[00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.410] In
[00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:36.770] particular,
[00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:36.930] it
[00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:37.110] also
[00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.490] matters
[00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.910] if
[00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:37.990] you
[00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.310] approximate
[00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.530] the
[00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:38.790] inverse,
[00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.090] and
[00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:39.390] thus,
[00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:39.690] for
[00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:40.010] GP
[00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.610] approximation.
[00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.190] OK?
[00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:43.150] So
[00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:43.390] you
[00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.510] can
[00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.810] think
[00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:43.930] of
[00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:44.230] this

[00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.050] In
[00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:51.190] the

[00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:51.710] that

[00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:54.450] that,
[00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:55.370] while

[00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:55.670] do

[00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:02.150] by
[00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.270] the
[00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.450] random
[00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.770] order.
[00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:04.990] But
[00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.250] you
[00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:05.350] could
[00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.530] also
[00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:05.750] think
[00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.830] of
[00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.930] a
[00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:06.090] different
[00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:06.430] strategy
[00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.730] that
[00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.170] selects
[00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:07.310] data
[00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.510] points
[00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.590] in
[00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.690] a
[00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:07.910] smarter
[00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:08.210] way.
[00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.770] And
[00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:08.890] we'll
[00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:09.070] see
[00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.250] that
[00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:09.670] later.
[00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.450] OK?
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.230] So
[00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.890] the
[00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:13.190] selection
[00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.390] of
[00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.510] data
[00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.870] points
[00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:14.450] that
[00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.570] you
[00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.810] choose
[00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:15.110] really
[00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.470] matters
[00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.650] for
[00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.850] how
[00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:16.130] quickly
[00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.330] you
[00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:16.710] converge
[00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.890] to
[00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:17.070] this
[00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.270] inverse
[00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.690] approximation,
[00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:18.010] and
[00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:18.150] thus,
[00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.310] to
[00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.470] the
[00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.670] GP
[00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:18.930] posterior.
[00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:21.290] So
[00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:21.370] how
[00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:21.430] do
[00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.530] we
[00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:21.630] do
[00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:21.770] this
[00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.070] smarter?
[00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.870] Can
[00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.990] we
[00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.210] find
[00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.470] better
[00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.830] actions
[00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.010] to
[00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:24.130] do
[00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:24.350] this?
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:26.720] So
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:26.820] on
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:26.960] the
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.200] left,
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.080] there's
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.420] another
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.220] illustration
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:29.500] of
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:29.680] this.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:29.900] So
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:30.400] inside
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:30.580] the
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:30.720] part
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:30.820] of
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.160] Cholesky,
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:31.440] there's
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:31.580] a
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:31.840] step
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.480] where
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:32.620] we
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:32.800] take
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:32.940] the
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:33.380] residual,
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:33.760] A
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.140] prime.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:35.480] So
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:35.700] the
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.040] part
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:37.160] of
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:37.280] the
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:37.520] matrix
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:37.660] that
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:37.760] we
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:37.960] haven't
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.220] learned
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:38.500] yet,
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:40.540] that
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:40.620] we
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:40.800] can
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.240] rewrite
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:41.900] via
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.260] this
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:45.940] part,
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:47.460] where
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:47.680] we
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.380] correct
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:48.740] our
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.180] action
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.060] with
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:50.540] the
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:50.900] inverse
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:51.300] approximation
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:51.520] from
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:51.620] the
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:51.840] previous
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.100] step.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.560] And
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:53.720] this
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:53.960] looks
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.260] like
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:54.760] this.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:54.960] So
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.220] this
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:55.320] is
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:55.460] the
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:55.960] residual,
[00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.710] after
[00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:58.270] also
[00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:58.510] 10
[00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:58.830] iterations
[00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:59.030] of
[00:21:59.030 --> 00:21:59.130] the
[00:21:59.130 --> 00:21:59.310] partial
[00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.710] Cholesky.
[00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:01.390] And
[00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.870] every
[00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:02.390] time
[00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.750] I
[00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.170] select,
[00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:03.490] I
[00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:03.810] chose
[00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:03.910] a
[00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:04.050] unit
[00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:04.310] vector
[00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.510] that
[00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.930] selects
[00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:05.070] one
[00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.150] of
[00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:05.290] these
[00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:05.470] data
[00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.710] points.
[00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.830] And
[00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.910] you
[00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:06.010] can
[00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:06.210] see
[00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:06.510] that
[00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.890] most
[00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:07.990] of
[00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.090] the
[00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.230] data
[00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.430] points
[00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.710] here
[00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.890] have
[00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:09.010] been
[00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.410] selected,
[00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:10.070] the
[00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.270] ones
[00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:10.650] here,
[00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.850] and
[00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.930] the
[00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:11.050] ones
[00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:11.230] down
[00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.410] here.
[00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:11.510] I
[00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.650] think
[00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:11.830] those
[00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.970] are
[00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:12.510] maybe
[00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.010] 30
[00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.210] data
[00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:13.410] points,
[00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:13.510] or
[00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.650] something
[00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:13.810] like
[00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:13.970] that.
[00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:15.570] So
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:15.670] in
[00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:15.850] each
[00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:16.110] step,
[00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.290] I
[00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:16.550] chose
[00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:16.670] a
[00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.150] data
[00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:17.390] point,
[00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:17.590] and
[00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.390] the
[00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.730] residual
[00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:18.930] of
[00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:19.010] the
[00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.230] matrix
[00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.390] looked
[00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.550] like
[00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:19.790] this.
[00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:21.050] But
[00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:21.330] why
[00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:21.450] do
[00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:21.490] I
[00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:21.610] have
[00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:21.670] to
[00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:21.970] restrict
[00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:22.350] myself
[00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.550] to
[00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:22.670] a
[00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:22.830] vector
[00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.990] that
[00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.130] looks
[00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:23.310] like
[00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.650] this?
[00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.350] The
[00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.830] operation
[00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.750] cost
[00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:27.150] per
[00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:27.630] iteration
[00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:28.350] is
[00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.030] squared
[00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:30.290] in
[00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:30.410] the
[00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:30.570] number
[00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:30.670] of
[00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:30.750] data
[00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.890] points
[00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:31.170] anyways.
[00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:31.590] So
[00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.710] I
[00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.810] can
[00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.170] afford
[00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:32.290] a
[00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:32.490] matrix
[00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:32.710] vector
[00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.070] multiplication
[00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.510] here.
[00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.070] I
[00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.190] can
[00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.310] choose
[00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.490] any
[00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:34.690] vector.
[00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:34.810] I
[00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:34.890] don't
[00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:35.010] have
[00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:35.110] to
[00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.410] select
[00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:35.570] a
[00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.750] column.
[00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:36.770] So
[00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:36.970] what
[00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:37.090] if
[00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:37.210] we
[00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:37.490] found
[00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.650] a
[00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:37.830] better
[00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:38.250] vector
[00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:38.910] with
[00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:39.150] some
[00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:39.410] different
[00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:39.790] entries,
[00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:40.130] maybe
[00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.350] even
[00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.570] more
[00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:40.710] than
[00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.990] one,
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:42.660] to
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.020] more
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.480] quickly
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.060] approximate
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:44.480] the
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:44.620] kernel
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.000] matrix
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.240] or
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:45.360] the
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:45.740] inverse,
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:46.980] which
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:47.160] we
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.540] just
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:47.900] learned
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.800] is
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:48.960] kind
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.040] of
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.160] the
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:49.380] same.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:50.860] And
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.160] here,
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:51.900] I
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:52.140] chose
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:52.380] some
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:52.780] strategy
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:52.980] that
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.100] I'm
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:53.180] going
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:53.260] to
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:53.400] tell
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:53.480] you
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:53.620] about
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:53.700] in
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:53.780] a
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:53.960] moment.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:54.240] And
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.580] clearly,
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:54.860] just
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.300] visually,
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:55.480] you
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:55.600] can
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:55.760] see
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:55.920] that
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.060] it's
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:56.240] more
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:56.660] close
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.240] to
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:57.400] the
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:57.660] true
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.200] matrix,
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:58.520] the
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:58.680] true
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:58.880] kernel
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.220] matrix.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:00.540] So
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:00.940] what's
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:01.060] a
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:01.240] better
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:01.660] way,
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.300] more
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:02.640] efficient
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.040] way,
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.100] to
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:04.360] choose
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:04.840] these
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.180] actions?
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:07.780] OK.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.020] So
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:08.160] this
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:08.220] is
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:08.320] the
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:08.440] second
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:08.620] part
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:08.680] of
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:08.760] the
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.020] talk.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.520] And
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:11.700] we'll
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:11.960] talk
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.100] about
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:12.240] a
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.600] method
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:12.960] called
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.060] the
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:13.200] method
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:13.360] of
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:13.620] conjugate
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.220] gradients
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:14.620] that's
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:14.900] originally
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.040] been
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.420] designed
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:15.620] to
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:15.980] solve
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.240] linear
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.780] systems
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.200] as
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:17.340] they
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:17.600] pop
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:17.820] up,
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:18.300] for
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:18.540] example,
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:18.700] in
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:18.880] GP
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.320] regression,
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:20.920] with
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.460] symmetric
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:21.840] positive
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.120] definite
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.600] matrices.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:23.460] Kernel
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:23.700] matrices
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.140] are
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:24.500] symmetric
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:24.780] positive
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.080] definite,
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:25.280] so
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:25.480] that's
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:25.720] great.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:26.840] And
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:26.980] now
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:27.140] we'll
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:27.400] dive
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:27.580] in
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:27.700] kind
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:27.760] of
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:27.840] a
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:27.920] little
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.040] bit
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.120] to
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.260] the
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.600] classic
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.000] view
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.400] of
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:29.520] how
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:29.680] this
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:29.920] method
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.220] works,
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:30.360] and
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:30.500] then
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:30.700] I'll
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.220] pull
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:31.300] you
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:31.620] back
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:31.860] into
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:32.760] this
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.740] view
[00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:35.310] of
[00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.830] actually
[00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:36.550] learning
[00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.670] about
[00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:38.110] the
[00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.450] matrix
[00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.450] or
[00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.190] learning
[00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.410] about
[00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:40.590] the
[00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.910] inverse,
[00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:41.270] as
[00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.450] we've
[00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.630] already
[00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.950] seen.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:43.740] OK.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:44.980] So
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:45.440] method
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:45.580] of
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:45.840] conjugate
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.360] gradients.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:47.620] Our
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:47.860] goal
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:48.140] is
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:48.780] to
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.460] solve
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:49.580] a
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:49.740] linear
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.140] system,
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:50.400] Ax
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:50.620] equals
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:50.840] b.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.140] So
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.340] A,
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:52.440] you
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:52.560] can
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:52.760] always
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:52.940] just
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:53.100] think
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:53.180] of
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:53.260] as
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:53.360] a
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:53.520] kernel
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:53.800] matrix
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.000] for
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.180] our
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:54.500] purposes.
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:55.980] And
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.080] you
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:56.200] want
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:56.300] to
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:56.440] do
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:56.840] that
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.620] with,
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.000] ideally,
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:23:59.440] very
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:23:59.960] few
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.620] matrix
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:00.860] vector
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.320] multiplies.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:01.660] So
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:01.940] just
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.160] a
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:02.340] few
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:02.800] quadratic
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.240] cost
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:03.800] operations
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.000] on
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.100] the
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.260] size
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:04.360] of
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:04.440] the
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:04.580] data
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:04.880] set
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.580] to
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.060] quickly
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:06.560] approximate
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:06.700] the
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:06.920] posterior.
[00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.230] Now
[00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.370] a
[00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:09.610] different
[00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:09.850] way
[00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:10.010] of
[00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.310] thinking
[00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.530] about
[00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:10.710] this
[00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:11.010] problem,
[00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:11.330] Ax
[00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.610] equals
[00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:11.850] b,
[00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:12.050] where
[00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:12.150] A
[00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:12.190] is
[00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.290] a
[00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:12.530] matrix
[00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:12.730] and
[00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:12.850] b
[00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:12.950] is
[00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:13.050] a
[00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:13.270] vector
[00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:13.450] of
[00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:13.670] size
[00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:14.030] n,
[00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:15.250] you
[00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:15.410] can
[00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:16.010] rephrase
[00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.350] this
[00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.930] as
[00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:17.050] a
[00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:17.370] quadratic
[00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:17.850] optimization
[00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:18.290] problem.
[00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:18.830] And
[00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.950] let
[00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.030] me
[00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:19.190] show
[00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.270] you
[00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:19.370] how
[00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.510] that
[00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.710] works.
[00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:20.210] So
[00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.930] take
[00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:21.290] this
[00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:22.110] quadratic
[00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.110] function,
[00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.130] where
[00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:24.430] the
[00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.710] argument
[00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.070] x
[00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.270] is
[00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:25.390] a
[00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:25.630] vector
[00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:25.830] of
[00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:26.030] size
[00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:26.350] n.
[00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:27.870] If
[00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.990] you
[00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.190] take
[00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.370] its
[00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.850] gradient,
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:30.680] then
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.160] setting
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:31.340] the
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:31.680] gradient
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:31.880] to
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.080] 0,
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:32.320] so
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:32.880] solving
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.740] this
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.060] or
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.020] optimizing
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:35.680] this
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.700] quadratic,
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.140] which
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:37.220] is
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:37.360] a
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:37.680] convex
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.100] optimization
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:38.380] problem,
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:38.540] so
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:38.640] it's
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:38.760] a
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.120] global
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:39.880] minimum,
[00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.390] is
[00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:42.670] actually
[00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:43.070] equivalent
[00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.470] to
[00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.730] solving
[00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:43.910] the
[00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:44.050] linear
[00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:44.350] system
[00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.650] Ax
[00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:44.910] equals
[00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:45.090] b.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:46.680] OK.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.400] So
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:47.800] taking
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:47.960] the
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.240] gradient
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:48.440] of
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:48.740] this,
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.140] just
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:49.320] this
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:49.740] Ax
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.180] minus
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:50.460] b,
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:50.960] setting
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:51.120] it
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:51.220] to
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:51.520] 0,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:52.580] means
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:52.760] it's
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:52.920] equivalent
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.120] to
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.360] Ax
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:53.600] equals
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:53.780] b.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:55.480] And
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:55.640] now
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:55.740] I
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:55.840] can
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.000] also
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.460] define
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.480] another
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.000] residual
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.360] here,
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.680] which
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:24:59.980] is
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:00.760] b
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.000] minus
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.320] Ax.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:01.720] So
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:01.860] if
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.000] I
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.320] plug
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:02.460] in
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:02.680] something
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:02.900] for
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:03.140] x,
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:03.340] that
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.420] tells
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:04.720] me
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.060] how
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.860] well
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:06.060] I've
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:06.260] solved
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:06.420] the
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:06.860] system,
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:07.340] or
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:07.980] equivalently,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:09.560] is
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:09.900] my
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.580] current
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.500] negative
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.100] gradient

[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.180] system.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:14.780] OK.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:14.880] So
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.000] it
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.320] points
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:15.580] in
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:15.680] the

[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:16.180] of

[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:17.740] So
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.000] what's
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.120] your

[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.460] algorithm?
[00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:22.050] Just
[00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:22.230] shout
[00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.330] it
[00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:22.470] out.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:25.760] Nobody
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:25.960] has
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.060] a

[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:26.900] optimization
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.240] algorithm?
[00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:31.030] All
[00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:31.130] right.
[00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:31.450] So
[00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:31.610] what
[00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.690] if
[00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:31.790] we
[00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:32.030] just
[00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.030] throw
[00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:33.350] gradient

[00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:34.110] problem,
[00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:34.310] right?
[00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.530] Why
[00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:34.770] not?
[00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:35.450] Gradient
[00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.650] descent,
[00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:35.930] super
[00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:36.230] easy.
[00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:36.410] We
[00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:36.550] can
[00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:36.770] compute
[00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:36.910] the
[00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:37.190] gradient.
[00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:37.790] It's
[00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:38.030] just
[00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.030] b
[00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:39.290] minus
[00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:39.630] Ax
[00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.410] for
[00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:40.570] the

[00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:41.290] position
[00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:41.610] x.
[00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.470] Why
[00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.550] don't
[00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:42.650] we
[00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:42.750] do
[00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.950] gradient

[00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:44.310] All
[00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.430] right.
[00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.710] So
[00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.550] here
[00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:45.630] on
[00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.770] the

[00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.530] So
[00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:54.670] the

[00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.190] equivalently
[00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.590] the

[00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:06.090] of
[00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:06.230] this
[00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.530] function,
[00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:06.970] and
[00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:07.090] as
[00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:07.190] we
[00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.350] just
[00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.670] learned,
[00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.470] the
[00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.750] solution
[00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.910] to

[00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:09.190] linear
[00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.450] system.
[00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:09.570] So
[00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.810] if
[00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:10.910] I
[00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:11.010] do
[00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:11.290] gradient
[00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:11.590] descent,
[00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:12.730] I
[00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.150] follow
[00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.030] the

[00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.510] of
[00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.830] steepest

[00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:16.030] what
[00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:16.130] I
[00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.230] get
[00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.330] is

[00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:17.170] here.
[00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:17.350] So
[00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.450] I
[00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.610] start
[00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:17.710] at
[00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.030] x0
[00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:18.350] here.
[00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:20.350] The
[00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:20.670] direction,
[00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.890] the
[00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:21.110] green
[00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.330] line,
[00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:21.510] is
[00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.990] orthogonal
[00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.350] to
[00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.930] the

[00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:24.830] lines.
[00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:26.130] Take
[00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:26.310] one
[00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.590] step,
[00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:26.870] and
[00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.970] I
[00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:27.090] can
[00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:27.310] actually
[00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.850] minimize
[00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.810] the

[00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:29.570]-dimensional
[00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:30.190] quadratic
[00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.690] along
[00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:30.990] this
[00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:31.490] distance
[00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.990] in
[00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.190] closed
[00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.410] form.
[00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:33.210] So
[00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:33.350] I
[00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.490] land
[00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:33.730] here,
[00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.990] right?
[00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:34.190] If
[00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.290] I
[00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:34.610] stepped
[00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.810] any
[00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:35.070] further,
[00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:35.230] I
[00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.330] would
[00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.530] actually
[00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:35.870] increase
[00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:36.030] my
[00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.250] function
[00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:36.490] value
[00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:36.770] again.
[00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:36.970] So
[00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:37.170] that's
[00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:37.370] great.
[00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:37.990] And
[00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.090] then
[00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.190] I
[00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.290] do
[00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:38.390] it
[00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.470] a
[00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.610] bunch
[00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:38.690] of
[00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.910] times.
[00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:39.070] So
[00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.310] one,
[00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:39.430] two,
[00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.630] three,
[00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:39.790] four,
[00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:40.070] five,
[00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.270] maybe
[00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:40.470] six

[00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.270] six
[00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:41.510] steps.
[00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:42.570] Fine,
[00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.830] right?
[00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.770] So
[00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:44.930] one
[00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:45.270] observation
[00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:45.610] here,

[00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:47.910] for

[00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:48.370] quadratic
[00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.770] are

[00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.470] Can

[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.540] slightly

[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.100] I

[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.780] Imagine

[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:49.440] OK?
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:49.760] You

[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:56.380] does
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.000] is
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.260] it
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:57.500] takes
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:57.800] right
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.080] angle
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:58.420] steps.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:27:59.320] OK?
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:01.220] Now,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:01.360] of
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:01.500] course,
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:01.800] we
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:01.900] don't
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:02.060] have
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.200] the
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:02.560] squished
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.760] space.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.500] We
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:05.640] have
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:05.960] this
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.680] elongated
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.040] space.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:07.680] So
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:07.780] in
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:07.880] this
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.260] elongated
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:08.620] space,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.100] taking
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:09.420] orthogonal
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:09.700] steps
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:09.940] actually
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:10.240] seems
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:10.380] to
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:10.520] be
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:10.700] a
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:10.920] fine
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.200] idea,
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:11.400] but
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:11.400] it
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:11.620] takes
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.020] six
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:12.360] steps,
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.100] versus
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:13.300] if
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:13.440] I
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:13.680] take
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.480] right
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:14.700] angle
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.060] steps
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.340] in
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:15.500] the
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:15.740] squished
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.080] space,
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:16.740] it
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:16.920] seems
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.020] to
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:17.500] just
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:17.740] take
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:17.980] two
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:18.260] steps.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:18.420] And
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:18.600] that's
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:18.920] actually
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.460] a
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:19.680] general
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:19.960] result
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.100] that
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:20.180] you
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:20.280] can
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:20.520] show
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:20.840] here,
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.140] that
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.120] if
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.260] you
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:23.500] follow
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:23.900] such
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.580] conjugate
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.020] directions,
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.280] let's
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:25.460] call
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:25.580] them
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:25.920] conjugate
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.260] being
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:26.540] another
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:26.800] word
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:26.980] for
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:27.440] orthogonal
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:27.720] in
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.620] a
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.320] product,
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:31.240] with
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:31.420] respect
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:31.520] to
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:31.560] an
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:31.780] arbitrary
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:31.960] inner

[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.160] I
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:33.300] can
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:33.660] converge
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:33.760] in
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:33.860] at
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:34.040] most
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.220] n
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:34.500] steps.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.440] And
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:36.580] now
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:36.760] let's
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:36.860] do
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:36.980] a
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:37.200] slight
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:37.600] modification
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:37.880] of
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.160] this,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.100] because
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.660] for
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:39.760] the
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:39.920] first
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.140] step,
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:40.300] we
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:40.420] don't
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:40.720] have
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.980] decided
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.220] yet
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:42.380] where
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:42.500] we
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:42.640] should
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:42.880] go,
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:43.060] right?
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:43.140] We
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.260] can
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:43.360] go
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:43.440] in
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:43.600] any
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.000] direction.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:44.740] Why
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:44.900] don't
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.040] we
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.240] just
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:45.600] take
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:45.860] our
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.180] negative
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:47.540] gradient
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:47.740] as
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:47.800] a
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:47.960] first
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.220] step,
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.160] walk
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:49.320] into
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:49.480] the
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:49.760] direction
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:49.900] of
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.200] steepest
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:50.480] descent,
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:50.680] and
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:50.820] then
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.040] just
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.640] modify
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.380] our
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:52.620] steps
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:52.960] always
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.240] to
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.200] satisfy
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:54.460] this
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:54.940] conjugacy
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:55.660] condition,
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:56.620] for
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:56.780] which
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:56.900] we
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.040] then
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:57.400] know
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.040] we
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:58.140] can
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:58.340] actually
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:58.780] converge
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:58.940] for
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:28:59.060] this
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.240] two
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:28:59.460] dimensional
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:28:59.980] problems
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.240] in
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:00.600] exactly
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:00.860] two
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.220] steps,
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:01.960] in
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.160] exact
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:03.540] arithmetic.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:04.600] OK?
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.160] So
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.340] that's
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:06.420] the
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:06.680] idea.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:07.980] And
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.120] this
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:08.200] is
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:08.300] what
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:08.400] the
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:08.680] algorithm
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:08.940] looks
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.140] like.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:09.500] So
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.080] don't
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:11.320] get
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:11.540] too
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:11.840] intimidated
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.100] by
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.540] all
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:12.720] the
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.060] symbols.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:13.260] I
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:13.420] just
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:13.600] want
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:13.700] you
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:13.840] to
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.000] kind
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.080] of
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.280] get
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:14.920] the
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.260] gist
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:15.400] of
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:15.600] what
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.640] the
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.960] individual
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.300] steps
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:18.620] do
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:18.940] in
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:19.120] this
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:19.460] graphic.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:19.860] OK?
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.000] So
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.100] I'm
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.220] just
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:20.320] going
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:20.400] to
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:20.700] explain
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:20.900] the
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.200] high
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:21.480] level
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:21.860] parts
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:21.980] of
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.240] this.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:22.940] And
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.400] it's
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:23.560] not
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:23.920] super
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.240] important
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:24.420] to
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:24.620] know
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.020] exactly
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.260] how
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:25.380] to
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:25.720] derive
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:25.980] these
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.280] steps.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:26.960] We'll
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.100] do
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.240] that
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:27.500] next
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:27.840] lecture
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.200] in
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:28.280] a
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:28.420] more
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:28.660] general
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.000] form.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:30.900] So
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:31.420] my
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:31.780] algorithm
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.480] gets
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.420] a
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:33.640] matrix
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:33.960] A,
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:34.300] a
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:34.520] vector
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:34.860] B,
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:35.220] and
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:35.340] an
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:35.600] initial
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:35.860] guess
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:35.980] for
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.100] the
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.360] solution
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:36.800] x0.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.640] I
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.380] have
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:38.640] some
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.020] stopping
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:39.500] criterion,
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:39.680] for
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:39.980] example,
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:40.320] based
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:40.520] on
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:40.680] the
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.020] gradient,
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:41.680] right?
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:41.940] The
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.120] gradient
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:42.420] norm.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:42.720] If
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:42.960] that's
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.280] 0,
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.240] we're
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.060] at
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:46.280] the
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:46.480] end
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:46.680] here.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.160] And
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:48.360] then
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:48.600] in
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:48.700] the
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:48.940] beginning,
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:49.400] I
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:49.800] compute
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.020] the
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.420] residual,
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:50.780] which
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:50.900] we
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.060] just
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:51.320] learned
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:51.440] is
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:51.600] just
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:51.720] a
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:51.920] negative
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.300] gradient,
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:52.520] right?
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:52.660] So
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:52.800] I
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.660] compute
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.060] the
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.600] steepest
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:54.780] descent
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.100] direction.
[00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.510] Then
[00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.950] to
[00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:58.250] actually
[00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.510] figure
[00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:58.690] out
[00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:58.790] in
[00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:58.950] which
[00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:59.930] direction
[00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:00.190] I
[00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.310] should
[00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.630] search,
[00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:00.750] in
[00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.870] which
[00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:01.150] direction
[00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:01.270] I
[00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:01.390] should
[00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:01.830] walk,
[00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:02.870] called
[00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.970] the
[00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:03.130] search
[00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:03.430] direction,
[00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.770] I
[00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:04.050] take
[00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:04.230] my
[00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.470] negative
[00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.930] gradient
[00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:05.490] step,
[00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:05.850] ri
[00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:06.170] minus
[00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:06.430] 1,
[00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:07.370] and
[00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.470] then
[00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:07.570] I
[00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:07.690] do
[00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:08.070] some
[00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.510] correction.
[00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:08.990] And
[00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.150] that
[00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:09.490] correction,
[00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:09.730] in
[00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:09.870] this
[00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.990] case,
[00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:10.290] depends
[00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:10.390] on
[00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:10.490] the
[00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.710] previous
[00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.970] step.
[00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:11.570] So
[00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.730] that's
[00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:11.810] the
[00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:12.170] intuition
[00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:12.570] that
[00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:13.410] when
[00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:13.590] I
[00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.870] take
[00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.970] a
[00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:14.190] gradient
[00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.490] step
[00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:15.090] in
[00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:15.430] green
[00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.810] here,
[00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:17.210] and
[00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.350] I
[00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.610] can't
[00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:17.810] take
[00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:18.170] the
[00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:18.350] next
[00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.530] gradient
[00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:18.690] step,
[00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.790] I
[00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:18.910] have
[00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:18.990] to
[00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.290] slightly
[00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:19.750] correct
[00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.010] it
[00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:20.710] for
[00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:21.210] what
[00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:21.350] I've
[00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.530] done
[00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:21.930] previously.
[00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:22.610] OK?
[00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.710] So
[00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.930] that's
[00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:23.090] this
[00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.570] correction
[00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.930] part
[00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:24.050] here,
[00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:24.210] this
[00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:24.610] minus,
[00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:25.570] depending
[00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:25.730] on
[00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:25.850] the
[00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:26.190] previous
[00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:26.670] search
[00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:26.970] direction.
[00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.910] And
[00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:28.050] then
[00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:28.430] finally,
[00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:29.310] based
[00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.430] on
[00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.530] the
[00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:29.690] search
[00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.990] direction,
[00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.170] I
[00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:30.330] can
[00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:30.710] update
[00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.990] my
[00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.310] estimate
[00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.490] for
[00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.610] the
[00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:31.930] solution
[00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.650] with
[00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:32.870] some
[00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:33.210] step
[00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:33.490] length,
[00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:33.650] and
[00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:33.770] the
[00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:33.990] step
[00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.290] length
[00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.130] is
[00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:35.330] the
[00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.730] exact
[00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:36.550] minimizer
[00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:36.950] along
[00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:37.170] this
[00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:37.550] direction.
[00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:38.090] And
[00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.150] you
[00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:38.250] can
[00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:38.410] see
[00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:38.690] here,
[00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:39.250] by
[00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:39.390] the
[00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:39.870] equipotential
[00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:40.130] lines,
[00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.270] if
[00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:40.370] I
[00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.470] would
[00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.730] walk
[00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:41.170] farther,
[00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.830] I
[00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.950] would
[00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:42.170] actually
[00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:42.570] increase
[00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:42.730] the
[00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:42.950] function
[00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:43.190] value
[00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.490] again.
[00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:44.070] OK?
[00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:44.290] So
[00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:44.450] this
[00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.570] is
[00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:44.810] the
[00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:45.710] minimum
[00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:46.210] along
[00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:46.450] this
[00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:46.850] direction.
[00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.450] All
[00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:48.550] right.
[00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.670] So
[00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:48.810] this
[00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:48.870] is
[00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.950] the
[00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:49.150] method
[00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:49.290] of
[00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:49.530] conjugate
[00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:49.970] gradients,
[00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:50.290] great.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.320] But
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:52.700] remember,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.480] we're
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:54.620] looking
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:54.780] for
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:54.900] a
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:55.100] method
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:55.560] that
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.300] approximates
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:56.440] the
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:56.720] inverse,
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.140] because
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:57.280] we
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:57.400] don't
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:57.580] only
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.020] have
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.140] to
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:58.340] solve
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:58.560] one
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:58.800] linear
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.140] system
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:30:59.340] for
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:30:59.480] the
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:30:59.680] mean,
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:00.320] but
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:00.660] also
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.260] multiple
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:01.680] ones
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.060] for
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:03.580] the
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.920] posterior
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.440] covariance,
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:05.640] right?
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:05.840] Because
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:05.940] we
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.060] have
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:06.260] this
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:06.620] right
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:06.840]-hand
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.660] side
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:07.940] is
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.100] a
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:08.540] kernel
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.080] evaluated
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:09.320] at
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.140] the
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:10.360] training
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:10.520] data
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:10.700] set
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:10.820] and
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:10.940] new
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.100] data
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:11.360] points.
[00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:13.550] OK.
[00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:13.990] So
[00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.190] can
[00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.310] we
[00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.630] also
[00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.890] do
[00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:15.050] the
[00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:15.270] same
[00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:15.570] thing,
[00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.670] or
[00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:15.970] similar
[00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:16.350] thing,
[00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:16.850] as
[00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.970] we
[00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.230] did
[00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.570] for
[00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:17.810] the
[00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:18.090] partial
[00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:18.510] Cholesky
[00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:19.990] by
[00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.470] interpreting
[00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.890] this
[00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:21.350] CG
[00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.970] method
[00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:22.770] as
[00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:23.290] one
[00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:23.450] that
[00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:23.730] also
[00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:24.310] constructs
[00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.430] an
[00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.830] approximation
[00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:25.130] to
[00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:25.210] the
[00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:25.430] inverse?
[00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:26.950] And
[00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:27.030] the
[00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:27.130] answer
[00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:27.310] is
[00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.590] yes,
[00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.850] of
[00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:28.010] course.
[00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.910] Otherwise,
[00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:29.030] I
[00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:29.110] wouldn't
[00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.250] be
[00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:29.410] telling
[00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:29.650] you.
[00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:31.050] So
[00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:31.410] now,
[00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.810] we
[00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:32.150] also
[00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:32.650] want
[00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:34.130] a
[00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:34.570] matrix
[00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:34.910] Ci
[00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:35.590] that
[00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:36.350] approximates
[00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.290] the
[00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:37.650] inverse
[00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.110] from
[00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.290] this
[00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:39.650] method,
[00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:40.410] and
[00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:40.570] we'll
[00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:40.750] see
[00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.890] that
[00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.030] this
[00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:41.150] is
[00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:41.390] also
[00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:41.630] low
[00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.870] rank,
[00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:42.050] in
[00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:42.210] the
[00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:42.450] same
[00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:42.710] way
[00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.890] that
[00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:42.990] it
[00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.110] was
[00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.310] low
[00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.490] rank
[00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.630] for
[00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:43.750] the
[00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.930] partial
[00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:44.330] Cholesky.
[00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:45.970] And
[00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:46.330] in
[00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:46.610] black,
[00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:47.010] I
[00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.190] just
[00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.530] carried
[00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:47.710] over
[00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:47.930] the
[00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:48.190] steps
[00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.350] and
[00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.510] maybe
[00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:48.850] slightly
[00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:49.510] reformulated
[00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:49.690] them,
[00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.850] so
[00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:50.310] let's
[00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.430] take
[00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:50.530] a
[00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:50.630] look
[00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.710] at
[00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.930] that.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:51.870] So
[00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.990] here,
[00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.070] for
[00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.210] the
[00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:52.430] search
[00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.930] direction,
[00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.950] sorry,
[00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:55.270] in
[00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:55.390] the
[00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:55.590] beginning,
[00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:55.890] I
[00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:56.170] compute
[00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:56.310] the
[00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.590] residual
[00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.970] again,
[00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.410] same
[00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:57.690] thing,
[00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.570] and
[00:31:58.570 --> 00:31:58.670] then
[00:31:58.670 --> 00:31:58.770] I
[00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:58.930] just
[00:31:58.930 --> 00:31:59.350] call
[00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.550] that
[00:31:59.550 --> 00:31:59.990] residual
[00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.290] my
[00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:00.710] action,
[00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.290] OK,
[00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:02.250] Si.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.360] And
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:04.640] now,
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:05.900] correcting
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.280] this
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:06.840] residual,
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.060] as
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:08.160] we
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:08.300] did
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:08.720] here,
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:10.080] turns
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:10.320] out
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:10.520] we
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:10.680] can
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:10.980] write
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.340] as
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.460] just
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:12.620] the
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:12.900] residual
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.380] itself
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:13.840] minus
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.040] the
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:14.440] correction
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:14.780] that
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:15.180] depends
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:15.500] on
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.380] the
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:16.680] previous
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:16.980] inverse
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.360] approximation,
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:18.260] OK?
[00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.920] So
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.680] this
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:19.940] term
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:20.260] here,
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.120] it
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:21.500] looks
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:21.700] very
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.120] complicated,
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:22.280] we
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:22.420] can
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:22.820] rewrite
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:23.540] with
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:23.720] the
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.160] same
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:24.820] structure
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.620] as
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:25.740] we
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:25.900] had
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.020] for
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:26.120] the
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.300] partial
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:26.620] Cholesky.
[00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:27.900] That's
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.040] the
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:28.460] conjugacy
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:28.840] correction.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:31.620] And
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:31.820] it
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:31.980] turns
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:32.160] out
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:32.480] that
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.660] this
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:34.920] search
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.300] direction,
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.040] if
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:36.140] we
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:36.300] take
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:36.480] the
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:36.660] outer
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.200] product
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:37.720] up
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:37.840] to
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.160] scaling
[00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.860] and
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.100] sum
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:39.280] that
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:39.520] up,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.100] that
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.400] turns
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:40.560] out
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:40.680] to
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:40.940] be
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.540] this
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:41.920] inverse
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.380] approximation.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:43.520] And
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:43.900] to
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.060] give
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:44.120] you
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:44.180] an

[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:45.340] sort

[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.220] that
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:47.540] works,
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:49.580] so
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:49.760] if
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:49.880] I
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.260] take

[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:01.240] or
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:01.580] if
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:01.740] this
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:01.880] was
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.380] consistent,
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:02.620] this

[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:05.840] it
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:05.960] should
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.060] be
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:06.220] the

[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:06.800] that
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.660] if
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:07.780] I
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:08.220] multiply
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:08.660] Ci,
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:08.980] the

[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:10.960] I
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.160] should
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:11.360] get
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:11.600] Xi,
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:12.200] right?
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:12.400] Otherwise,
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:12.620] I'm
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:12.880] actually
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.660] sort
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:13.860] of
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.760] developing
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.080] two
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:15.380] different
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:15.740] estimates
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:15.960] for
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.080] the

[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:16.960] linear
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.300] system.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:17.920] So
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:17.980] it
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:18.160] only
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:18.440] makes
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:18.780] sense
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:19.900] if
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.100] the
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:20.380] Ci
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:20.880] actually
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.840] is
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.180] equal
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:22.380] to
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:22.660] Xi
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.040] if
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:23.140] I
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:23.440] multiply
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:23.600] it
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:23.680] with
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:23.780] the
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:23.920] right
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.040] hand
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:24.240] side,
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:24.460] because
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:24.620] it's
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:24.740] an
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.200] approximation
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:25.540] to
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:25.640] the
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:25.880] inverse.
[00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:28.430] So
[00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.950] now,
[00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:29.810] we
[00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:30.050] know
[00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:30.330] that
[00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:30.630] the
[00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:31.050] update
[00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:31.630] for
[00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:31.810] the
[00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:32.070] solution
[00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.530] estimate
[00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:33.030] involves
[00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:33.450] this
[00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:34.490] conjugate
[00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.930] direction
[00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:35.190] Di,
[00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.610] right?
[00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:35.790] That's
[00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:35.930] the
[00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:36.150] update
[00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:36.290] up
[00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:36.390] to
[00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:36.650] scaling.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:38.620] So
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:38.840] this
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.300] matrix
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.600] Ci
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.000] here,
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:40.540] if
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:40.700] that
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.040] is
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:41.160] to

[00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.830] if
[00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.990] it's

[00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:53.710] times
[00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:54.370] all
[00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:54.490] the

[00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:55.290] stacked

[00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:55.810] rows,
[00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:56.150] because
[00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:56.430] then
[00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.890] I
[00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:57.010] get
[00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:57.170] a

[00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:01.150] here.
[00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:01.810] And
[00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:01.990] that's
[00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.330] exactly
[00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.550] the

[00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.930] that
[00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:03.050] we
[00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:03.230] see
[00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.450] here,
[00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:03.630] right?
[00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:03.770] We
[00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:04.550] get
[00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:05.370] one
[00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:05.950] Di
[00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:06.310] times

[00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:08.590] per
[00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:09.070] iteration.
[00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.530] So
[00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:10.650] I
[00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:10.950] realize
[00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:11.110] that
[00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:11.310] that's
[00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.650] a

[00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:12.170] to
[00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:12.450] take
[00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:12.730] in,
[00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:13.370] but
[00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:13.470] it's
[00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.630] actually
[00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:13.810] not
[00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:14.010] so
[00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:14.310] important
[00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.550] to
[00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:15.010] understand
[00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:15.270] where
[00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.430] this
[00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.650] comes
[00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:15.850] from,
[00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:16.030] because
[00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.170] we're
[00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:16.350] doing
[00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:16.490] that
[00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:16.750] next
[00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:17.030] week.
[00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.590] But
[00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:18.390] think
[00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:18.690] of
[00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:19.390] the,
[00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.890] what
[00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:19.990] I
[00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.130] want
[00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:20.210] you
[00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:20.290] to
[00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:20.430] get
[00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.550] is
[00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.770] this
[00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:21.110] intuition
[00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:21.370] here,
[00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:21.630] OK?
[00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:22.650] I
[00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:22.830] can
[00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:23.410] select
[00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:24.270] actions
[00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.250] that
[00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.870] actually
[00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:26.590] solve
[00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:26.750] this
[00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.890] linear
[00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:27.130] system
[00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:27.390] very
[00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:27.710] quickly,
[00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.970] and
[00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:28.110] we'll
[00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:28.270] see
[00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.410] that
[00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:28.510] in
[00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.610] a
[00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:28.790] moment.
[00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.770] OK.
[00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.610] A
[00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:32.730] quick
[00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:33.170] comparison
[00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:33.390] to
[00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:33.530] the
[00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.770] partial
[00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:34.150] Cholesky
[00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:34.290] that
[00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:34.390] we
[00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:34.550] saw
[00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.950] before,
[00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.790] you'll
[00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:36.470] recognize
[00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.790] now
[00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.930] a
[00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:37.070] bunch
[00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.190] of
[00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.490] things
[00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.670] here,
[00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:37.930] right?
[00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.170] Here
[00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:38.310] we
[00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.650] selected
[00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:38.850] a
[00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:39.050] unit
[00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.410] vector
[00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:39.550] as
[00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.630] an
[00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:39.890] action.
[00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:41.350] Here
[00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:41.550] we're
[00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.890] selecting
[00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:42.790] the
[00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:43.150] residual
[00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:43.430] or
[00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.730] negative
[00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:44.090] gradient.
[00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:46.970] Here
[00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:47.550] we're
[00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.250] slightly
[00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:48.930] modifying
[00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:49.810] our
[00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:50.950] action,
[00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:52.250] doing
[00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.430] the
[00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.670] same
[00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:52.930] thing
[00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:53.130] over
[00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:53.510] here
[00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.830] for
[00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:53.990] the
[00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.310] residual
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.190] to
[00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.410] get
[00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:55.570] the
[00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:55.750] search
[00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:56.070] direction.
[00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:58.090] We're
[00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:58.530] estimating
[00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:58.690] an
[00:34:58.690 --> 00:34:58.950] inverse
[00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.210] here
[00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.430] with
[00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.590] a
[00:34:59.590 --> 00:34:59.770] low
[00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:00.010] rank,
[00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:00.310] actually
[00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.570] rank
[00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:00.810] one
[00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:01.290] update.
[00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:02.830] Same
[00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:03.050] thing
[00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.230] over
[00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.570] here.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.360] Now,
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:05.520] of
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:05.720] course,
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:06.360] for
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:06.480] the
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:06.740] Cholesky,
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:06.880] we
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.040] didn't
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:07.280] actually
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:07.920] solve
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.040] a
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.400] specific
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:08.680] linear
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.000] system,
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:09.180] so
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:09.300] we
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:09.600] didn't
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:09.980] have
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.120] a
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:10.340] step
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:10.520] where
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:10.740] we
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.300] estimate
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:11.460] a
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:11.760] solution.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:12.440] But
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:12.620] actually,
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:12.800] we
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.160] could
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.320] compute
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:14.760] the
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.880] solution
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.060] here
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:16.200] as
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:16.420] well
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:16.740] by
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:16.900] doing
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.040] the
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:17.180] same
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:17.460] thing,
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:17.940] multiplying
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.160] the
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:18.340] inverse
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:18.780] approximation
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.000] with
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:19.080] the
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:19.200] right
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:19.340] hand
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:19.480] side,
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:20.360] OK?
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:20.520] So
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:20.760] these
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.380] algorithms
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:21.580] are
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:21.740] actually
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.000] very
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.380] similar.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:22.920] We
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.100] just
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.580] typically
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.060] understand
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:25.260] them
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:25.400] from
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:25.660] very
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.080] different
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:26.580] angles.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:28.800] OK.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:29.280] So
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:29.620] let's
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:29.840] compare
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.040] them
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:30.220] for
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:30.440] GP
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:30.740] inference.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:30.920] So
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.020] we
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:31.200] just,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:31.480] again,
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:31.940] replace
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:32.200] the
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:32.600] kernel
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:32.900] matrix
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:33.140] inverse
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:33.900] with
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.120] this
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:34.540] CI,
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:34.920] the
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.580] inverse
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.080] approximation.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.160] On
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:37.340] the
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:37.540] left
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:37.740] here,
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:37.880] we
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:37.980] have
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.100] the
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.360] partial
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:38.780] Cholesky
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:38.960] for
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.180] tenor
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:39.600] durations
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:39.960] with
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.800] randomly
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.260] sampled
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:41.480] data
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:41.740] points.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:42.780] You
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:42.880] can
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.040] see
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:43.360] that
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.380] where
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:44.600] we
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:44.820] pick
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.080] data
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:45.460] points,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:46.740] the
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.320] uncertainty
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.560] is
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.100] contracted.
[00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.890] And
[00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:50.070] here
[00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:50.230] is
[00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.530] conjugate
[00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:51.010] gradient,
[00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:52.210] which
[00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:52.970] automatically,
[00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:53.430] we
[00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.550] don't
[00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.710] even
[00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.890] have
[00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:54.070] to
[00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:54.510] specify
[00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.730] what
[00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:54.890] data
[00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:55.090] points
[00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:55.230] to
[00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.430] pick
[00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.690] because
[00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:55.810] of

[00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.230] strategy,
[00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:58.550] actually
[00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:59.050] is
[00:35:59.050 --> 00:35:59.350] much
[00:35:59.350 --> 00:35:59.610] more
[00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:00.130] contracted
[00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:00.930] and
[00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:01.270] matches
[00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.450] the

[00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.370] right?
[00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.530] The

[00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:07.650] The
[00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:07.910] black
[00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:08.090] is
[00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:08.210] what
[00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.330] we
[00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:08.570] want.
[00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:10.790] So
[00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.050] this
[00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:11.650] intuitively
[00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:11.930] kind
[00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:12.010] of
[00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:12.490] shows
[00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:13.590] that
[00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.290] the
[00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:14.490] method
[00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:14.670] of
[00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.950] conjugate
[00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.190] gradient
[00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.490] seems
[00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:15.650] to
[00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.890] converge
[00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:16.150] much,
[00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.290] much
[00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:16.710] faster.
[00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:17.910] And
[00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:18.150] what
[00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.070] is
[00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:19.190] this
[00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.570] interpretation
[00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:19.850] of
[00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.150] these
[00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.570] actions?
[00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:21.830] So
[00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:21.970] the
[00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:22.270] actions
[00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.410] you
[00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:22.510] can
[00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:22.790] think
[00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.970] of
[00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:23.370] as
[00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.730] probing
[00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:25.810] the
[00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.490] matrix
[00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:26.730] that
[00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:26.850] we
[00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:27.070] care
[00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:27.270] about,
[00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.370] that
[00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:27.470] we
[00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.630] want
[00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.750] to
[00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.130] invert
[00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.670] in
[00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.810] a
[00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:28.950] certain
[00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:29.270] way.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.050] And
[00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.390] however
[00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.010] you
[00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.410] structure
[00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:31.630] that
[00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.170] action
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.440] probes
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:33.780] the
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.220] matrix
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:34.340] in
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:34.400] a
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:34.540] different
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:34.740] way.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:34.960] So
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.440] here,
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:35.760] for
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.740] this

[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.060] then
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:39.180] we
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:39.340] probe
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:39.460] at
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:39.640] this
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:39.920] point,
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:40.080] then
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:40.200] we
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:40.340] probe
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:40.460] at
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:40.620] this
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:40.840] point,
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:40.940] and
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:41.020] then
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:41.100] at
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:41.260] this
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:41.540] point.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.120] And
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:42.220] the
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:42.400] GP
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:42.880] approximation
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.400] contracts
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:43.640] around.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:44.760] For
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.120] CG,
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:45.880] our

[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:46.640] vector,
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:47.320] in
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:47.700] general,
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:49.260] probes
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.240] where
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:50.720] our
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.400] estimate
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.620] of
[00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:52.830] the
[00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:53.170] posterior
[00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:53.610] mean
[00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:54.510] is
[00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.710] still
[00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:55.030] far
[00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.250] away
[00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.430] from
[00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.570] the
[00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:55.710] data
[00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.950] set.
[00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:56.170] So
[00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:56.330] it
[00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:56.810] probes
[00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:57.470] globally
[00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.970] at
[00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:58.290] every
[00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:58.530] single
[00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:58.730] data
[00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:59.090] point,
[00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.530] in
[00:36:59.530 --> 00:36:59.830] general,
[00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.890] and
[00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:01.430] scaled
[00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.850] with
[00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:02.250] how
[00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:02.510] far
[00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.790] away
[00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.930] I
[00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:03.030] am
[00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.150] from
[00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.270] the
[00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.390] data
[00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:03.610] point.
[00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:03.950] That's
[00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:04.210] exactly
[00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:04.410] what
[00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:04.530] the
[00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:04.770] residual
[00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:05.150] is.
[00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:05.870] If
[00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.970] you
[00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:06.150] take
[00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.250] a
[00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:06.350] look
[00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:06.610] back
[00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:06.790] here,
[00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:07.090] it's
[00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:07.670] for
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.280] GPs,
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:09.700] it's
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:09.940] the
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:10.280] data,
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:10.700] B
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.360] is
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:11.520] the
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:11.900] data
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.280] Y,
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.000] minus
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.260] the
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:13.440] kernel
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:13.820] matrix,
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.460] times
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:14.940] the
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:15.260] representative
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:15.500] weights.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:16.980] So
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:17.740] that's
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:17.820] the
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.140] intuition
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:18.360] why
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:18.520] this
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:18.740] works
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:18.880] so
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.040] well
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.220] for
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:19.600] GPs.
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:22.640] Notice,
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.040] I'm
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.240] already
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:23.640] using
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.060] terms
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:24.300] that
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:24.400] you
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:24.600] might
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:24.820] know
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.160] from
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:25.820] other
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.380] machine
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:26.700] learning
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.100] courses.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.260] Action
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:28.660] in
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:28.780] terms
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:28.980] of
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:29.500] deciding
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:29.740] where
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:29.860] to
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.240] evaluate
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:30.420] or
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:30.560] where
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:30.680] to
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:30.940] observe.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.100] Learning
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:34.820] about
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.020] the
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:35.260] inverse
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:35.760] matrix.
[00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:37.270] And
[00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.410] we'll
[00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:37.630] see
[00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.990] a
[00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.530] lot
[00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:38.690] more
[00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.790] of
[00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.910] this
[00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:39.130] language
[00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:39.430] later.
[00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:43.070] So
[00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:43.590] we
[00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:43.850] saw
[00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:44.130] that,
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:48.720] apologies,
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:52.780] there
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:52.860] we
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.000] go.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.040] So
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.200] we
[00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.170] intuitively,
[00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.970] based
[00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:58.090] on
[00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:58.230] this
[00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.550] picture,
[00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.730] it
[00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.890] seems
[00:37:58.890 --> 00:37:59.070] like
[00:37:59.070 --> 00:37:59.470] the
[00:37:59.470 --> 00:37:59.930] method
[00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:00.050] of
[00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.310] conjugate
[00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.830] gradients
[00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:01.210] converges
[00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:01.430] much
[00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.750] faster.
[00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:02.030] But
[00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.210] actually,
[00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:02.350] how
[00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:02.650] fast
[00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:02.750] does
[00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.850] it
[00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:03.130] converge?
[00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:05.230] And
[00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.370] now
[00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:05.470] I
[00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.510] have
[00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.590] to
[00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:05.750] take
[00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.890] a

[00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.510] numerics
[00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:06.970] interlude
[00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:07.690] to
[00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:07.950] actually
[00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:08.510] analyze
[00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.890] this.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:10.840] For
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:10.980] those
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.100] of
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:11.240] you
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:11.400] that
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:11.620] haven't

[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:12.320] with
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:12.580] numerics
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:12.800] too
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.080] much,
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:13.480] here
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:13.600] is
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:13.840] a

[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:14.820] slide
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:15.020] for
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:15.180] the

[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:15.620] most
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:15.940] important

[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:16.660] from
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:16.800] your

[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:17.420] lecture.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:18.240] I
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:18.360] hope
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:18.540] I'm
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:18.680] not
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:18.940] stepping
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:19.040] on
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.480] anybody's
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:19.620] toes
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:19.860] here.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:20.560] So
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:20.660] the
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:20.820] first
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:20.980] one

[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.220] Whenever
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:24.660] we're
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.040] working
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.600] on
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:26.780] a
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.140] computer
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:27.380] and
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:27.600] not

[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.140] mathematics,
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:30.940] there's
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.680] unavoidable
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.080] rounding
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:32.380] error.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:32.620] Because
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:32.780] I
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.120] store,
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:33.420] I
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:33.520] can
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:33.660] only
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:33.920] store
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.080] my

[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:34.500] on
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:34.640] my
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:34.980] machine
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:35.640] up
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:35.720] to

[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.320] precision.
[00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.790] So
[00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:38.530] I
[00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:38.730] call
[00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:38.890] that

[00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.530] just

[00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.290] FL,
[00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:42.130] of
[00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:42.510] some

[00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:43.850] that
[00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:43.970] I
[00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:44.090] can
[00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:44.370] store
[00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:44.470] on
[00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.590] my
[00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:44.910] machine

[00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:46.190] tilde.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:48.010] Now,
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.340] whenever
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:49.800] I
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.260] have

[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:52.980] and
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.100] I
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:53.520] apply

[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:54.580] to

[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:54.860] for
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.180] example,
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.180] solve
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:56.300] a

[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:57.320] and

[00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.240] on
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:38:59.400] my

[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:00.500] those

[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.240] And
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:04.360] if
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:04.480] I
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.440] apply

[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:09.320] that

[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.280] I
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:11.600] still
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:11.780] have

[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:16.280] So
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:16.540] also
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:16.740] my
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.180] outputs

[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:26.640] that
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.100] I'm
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:27.300] trying

[00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:29.790] for

[00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:35.730] So
[00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:36.210] technically,
[00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:36.410] it's

[00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:39.690] unavoidable
[00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:39.870] error
[00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:40.350] amplification.
[00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:41.430] And
[00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.650] that
[00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:41.890] turns
[00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:42.030] out
[00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.150] to
[00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.390] be
[00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.910] the

[00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:46.010] divided
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:46.520] by

[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:48.420] terms.
[00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:49.950] So
[00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:50.130] if
[00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:50.810] you
[00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:51.070] think
[00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:51.290] of
[00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.850] the

[00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:53.330] representing

[00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:54.870] as
[00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:55.010] we
[00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.250] had
[00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.450] just
[00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:55.590] a
[00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:55.730] few
[00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.990] slides
[00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.290] ago,
[00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:57.150] here
[00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:57.270] are
[00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.350] the
[00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:57.590] blue
[00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:57.930] lines.
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:58.980] In
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:59.140] this
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:39:59.440] case,
[00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.750] how
[00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.190] elongated
[00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.690] this
[00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:03.090] quadratic
[00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:03.510] is
[00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.930] in
[00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:04.110] its
[00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:04.530] largest

[00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:05.630] direction
[00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:06.310] divided
[00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:06.490] by

[00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:07.450] elongation
[00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:07.770] direction.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:10.740] Sorry,
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:10.900] the
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:11.000] other
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.160] way
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:11.320] around.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:12.600] Smallest
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:12.800] divided
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:12.960] by
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:13.240] largest.
[00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.430] But
[00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.550] it's
[00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.850] largest
[00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:15.170] eigenvalue
[00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.370] divided
[00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:15.490] by
[00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:16.030] smallest.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:17.580] And
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:17.700] then
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:17.860] there's
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:17.980] a
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.140] second
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:18.500] quantity,
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:18.620] and
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:18.720] this
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:18.780] is
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:18.920] just
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.040] as

[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.180] Now
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:21.300] what
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:21.580] happens
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:21.700] if
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:21.800] I
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.020] actually
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.280] try
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:22.480] to
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:22.840] implement
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.300] this

[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:24.720] operation
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.200] in

[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:27.560] like

[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.200] Cholesky,
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:29.920] then
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.100] there
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:30.260] is
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.040] additional

[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:31.780] coming
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.260] from
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:32.960] this
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.500] implementation,
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:34.040] maybe
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:34.280] doing
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:34.400] a

[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.120] or
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:36.420] just
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:36.620] not

[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.500] And
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:41.680] if
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.000] then
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.760] my
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.000] error
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.120] is
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:43.320] not

[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:43.760] large,
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:43.960] not
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.100] too
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:44.280] far
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:44.500] away
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:44.680] from
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:44.860] this
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:45.360] unavoidable
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:45.960] amplification,
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:46.600] I

[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:46.940] that
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.320] stability.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:50.620] Now,
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:50.740] for
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:50.900] example,
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.080] the
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:51.480] Cholesky
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.000] is

[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:53.280] So
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.900] if
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.140] you
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:55.380] solve

[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:01.860] of

[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:04.520] depending
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:04.720] on
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:04.880] what

[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:05.200] you
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:05.400] measure
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:05.520] it
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:05.660] in.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:06.740] OK,
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:06.960] so
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.500] if
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:07.660] that's

[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:13.980] Machine
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.540] precision,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:15.120] so

[00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:18.030] is

[00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:20.550] So
[00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.630] if

[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:24.920] going
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.000] to
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:25.200] solve

[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:27.540] desire

[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:31.600] All
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:31.760] right,
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:32.520] so
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.400] now
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:33.520] we
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:33.640] can
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:33.940] analyze
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:34.060] the

[00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.730] And

[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:53.620] And
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:53.720] on
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:53.840] the
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.060] y

[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:56.240] So
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:56.640] that's
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.660] the

[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.380] minus

[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.700] in
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:01.900] a

[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:03.100] And
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:03.200] it
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:03.360] turns
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:03.580] out
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:03.860] that,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:04.400] so
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:04.560] first
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:04.660] of
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:04.780] all,
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.040] let's
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:05.320] observe
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:05.640] that
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.780] we
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:07.060] can't
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:07.300] actually
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:07.740] reach
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.700] the
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.120] double
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:10.640] machine
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:10.980] precision
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.400] accuracy
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:11.740] at
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.180] roughly
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:12.340] 10
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:12.420] to
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:12.480] the
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:12.600] minus
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.060] 16,
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:13.920] because
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.060] our
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:14.320] condition
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:14.560] number
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:14.700] is
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:14.820] pretty
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:15.100] large.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:18.600] Now,
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:18.700] it's
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:18.800] not
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.260] exactly
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:19.700] that
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:19.820] we
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:19.940] can
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.120] just
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:20.480] add
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.200] five
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:21.800] orders
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:21.920] of

[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:22.320] to
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:22.600] this,
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:22.960] because
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.780] technically
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.060] this
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:24.200] is
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:24.340] in
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:24.500] 2
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:24.720] norm
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:24.820] and
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:24.920] this
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.000] is
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.100] in
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:25.200] a
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:25.400] norm,
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:25.600] but
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.000] certainly
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.180] we
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:26.360] cannot
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:26.740] reach
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:26.940] 10
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.020] to
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:27.080] the
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:27.200] minus
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:27.520] 16
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:27.740] here.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:29.940] What
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:30.200] it
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:30.460] turns
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:30.600] out
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:30.680] for
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:30.840] this
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.180] method
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:32.660] of

[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:34.760] rate,
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:34.920] so
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.100] how
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:35.440] quickly
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:35.660] it
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.040] converges
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:36.220] to

[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:37.280] is
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:37.540] given
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.020] by
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.140] this

[00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:47.630] So

[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:03.960] If

[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:11.480] with
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:11.660] i?
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.040] What
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.560] is
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.060] the
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.880] numerator
[00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:21.670] if
[00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:22.190] kappa
[00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.370] of
[00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.590] i
[00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:22.750] is
[00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:22.970] close
[00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:23.110] to
[00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:23.310] 1?
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:25.640] Just
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:25.820] shout
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:25.920] it
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.100] out.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:28.920] Close
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.040] to
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:29.240] 0,
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:29.620] okay?
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.280] What
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:30.500] about
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.060] the
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:31.720] denominator?
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:35.520] Close
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:35.640] to
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:35.800] 2.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:36.820] So
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.000] this
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:37.220] is
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:37.780] almost
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.100] what?
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:40.480] So
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:40.620] if
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:40.780] now
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:40.940] I
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:41.120] take
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.260] that
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:41.400] to
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:41.520] a
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:41.900] power,
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:42.340] does
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:42.480] it
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:42.800] decrease
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.080] fast
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:43.200] or
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:43.500] slow,
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:45.880] compared
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.220] to
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:46.620] if,
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.180] let's
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:47.340] say
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:47.580] kappa
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:47.960] of
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:48.320] A
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:48.780] is
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:49.780] a
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:50.000] million,
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:51.720] what
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:51.880] is
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:52.140] the
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:52.600] fraction
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:52.920] here,
[00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:54.570] roughly?
[00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:57.270] Almost
[00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.510] 1.
[00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.570] So
[00:43:58.570 --> 00:43:58.890] what
[00:43:58.890 --> 00:43:59.390] converges
[00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.770] faster,
[00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.970] if
[00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:00.150] kappa
[00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.350] is
[00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:00.470] a
[00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.650] million
[00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.810] or
[00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:00.910] if
[00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:01.050] kappa
[00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:01.230] is
[00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.450] 1?
[00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.610] 1,
[00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:03.030] right?
[00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.570] Because
[00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:03.750] then
[00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:04.390] this
[00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.610] thing
[00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:04.870] here
[00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:05.070] is
[00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:05.350] almost
[00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:05.670] 0,
[00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:05.930] so
[00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:06.210] this
[00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:06.510] arrow
[00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:06.930] decreases
[00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:07.250] really
[00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.670] fast,
[00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:08.610] okay?
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.000] Because
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:10.100] if
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:10.220] this
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:10.320] is
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:10.440] a
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:10.660] million,
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:11.220] then
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:11.340] this
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:11.460] is
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:11.680] almost
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.040] 1,
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:12.260] and
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:12.380] if
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:12.520] it's
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:12.680] 1,
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:12.800] it
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:12.980] doesn't
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:13.240] decrease
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:13.380] at
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:13.540] all.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:14.540] So
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:14.660] the
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:14.880] closer
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.040] to
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.180] 1
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:15.320] we
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:15.440] are,
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:15.620] the
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:15.820] slower
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:15.980] we
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.260] converge.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:17.500] So
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:17.800] here,
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:18.680] we
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:18.780] should
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.120] expect
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.140] actually
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:20.360] not
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:20.620] such
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:20.960] fast
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.320] convergence,
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:21.580] right?
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:21.760] The
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.120] condition
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:22.300] number
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:22.400] is
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:22.600] quite
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:22.960] large.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:23.500] It
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:23.640] turns
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:23.800] out
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.120] it
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:24.360] converges
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:24.640] still
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.300] quite
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:25.540] okay
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:25.720] in
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:25.860] a
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:26.040] few
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:26.240] hundred

[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.020] relative
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:27.240] to
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:27.380] the
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:27.600] problem
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:27.940] size
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.140] 1
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:28.380],000,
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:28.740] that's
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:28.880] not
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.040] too
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:29.240] bad.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.160] By
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:30.260] the
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:30.420] way,
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:30.860] I
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.080] only
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:31.400] chose
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:31.720] such
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:31.840] a
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:32.120] small
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:32.640] problem
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.080] here
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:33.740] because
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:33.860] I
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:34.040] actually
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:34.220] need
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:34.320] to
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:34.560] compute
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:34.680] the

[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:35.340] to
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:35.660] evaluate
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:35.960] this,
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.020] right?
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:37.260] So
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:37.340] I
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:37.440] need
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:37.540] to
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:37.660] be
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:37.800] able
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.300] to
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:38.800] compute
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:38.940] a
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:39.280] Cholesky
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:39.480] to
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:39.600] get
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:39.720] a

[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:40.400] that's
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:40.660] within

[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.320] unavoidable
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:42.540] error.
[00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:44.830] So
[00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:44.990] we
[00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.110] can
[00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:45.290] see
[00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:45.590] that
[00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:45.910] CED
[00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:46.290] converges
[00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:46.790] fast
[00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:47.110] if
[00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:47.210] the

[00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:48.350] is
[00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:48.630] small.
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:50.120] But
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.220] does

[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:50.560] it
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:50.880] converges
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.480] fast
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:51.740] for

[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:52.280] that

[00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.990] And
[00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:22.150] the
[00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.410] reason
[00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:22.770] is,
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.180] let's
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:28.320] take
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:28.420] a
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:28.620] look,
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:29.560] here's
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:29.660] the
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:29.820] kernel
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:30.200] matrix,
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:30.460] K
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:30.620] plus
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:30.820] sigma
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:31.060] squared
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:31.300] I.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:32.200] K
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:32.320] is
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:32.460] an
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:32.700] SPD
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:33.260] matrix,
[00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:34.730] or

[00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.450]-definite,
[00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.770] because
[00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:36.890] it's
[00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:36.990] a
[00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.250] kernel
[00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:37.970] matrix,
[00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:38.670] so
[00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.790] we
[00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.950] can
[00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:39.310] do
[00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:39.450] an

[00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:41.030] Q
[00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.870] are
[00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.990] the
[00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.590] eigenvectors,
[00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:43.510] and
[00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.850] lambda
[00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:44.290] is
[00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:44.390] a
[00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.630] diagonal
[00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.970] matrix
[00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:45.130] with

[00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:46.350] diagonal.
[00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:47.790] Now
[00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:47.910] we
[00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:48.070] can
[00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:48.390] find

[00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:50.530] has
[00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:51.990] orthogonal

[00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:55.170] I
[00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:55.270] can
[00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.470] just

[00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:00.630] I
[00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.750] can

[00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.710] What

[00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:40.290] if
[00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:40.390] I
[00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.610] take
[00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:40.870] sigma

[00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:44.910] Just
[00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:45.090] shout.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.260] Take

[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:56.540] Just
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:56.720] the

[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:57.380] number
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:57.760] of
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.440] K,
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:58.720] right?
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.160] Lambda
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:46:59.540] max
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.420] of
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.540] K
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:01.860] divided

[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:03.420] It
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:03.600] turns
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:03.800] out
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.040] that
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:04.360] for
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:04.620] most
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.040] kernels,
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:05.560] these
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:05.680] are
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:05.980] very,
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:06.200] very
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:06.460] different
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:06.820] numbers.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:08.080] Such
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:08.380] matrices
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:08.600] are
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:08.820] very,
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:09.020] very
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:09.280] badly
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:09.640] conditioned,
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:09.840] so
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:10.040] lambda
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:10.280] max
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:10.460] is
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.000] much
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:11.300] higher,
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:11.640] much
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:11.880] larger
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.060] than

[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:12.460] min.
[00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:14.010] So
[00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:14.410] if
[00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:14.510] I
[00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.970] increase
[00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:15.230] sigma

[00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.750] the
[00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:16.030] opposite
[00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.470] happens,
[00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:16.750] right?
[00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:16.990] In
[00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.110] the
[00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:17.350] extreme
[00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:17.570] case,
[00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:17.690] if
[00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.770] I
[00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:17.890] let
[00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:18.030] that
[00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.210] go
[00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:18.490] to
[00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:19.290] infinity,
[00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:19.850] then
[00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:20.110] this
[00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:20.550] converges
[00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:20.710] to
[00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.950] one.
[00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:21.470] Obviously,
[00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:21.770] then
[00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.070] I
[00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:22.770] assume
[00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:22.950] that
[00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:23.050] I
[00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:23.250] have
[00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:23.550] very
[00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:23.830] large

[00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:24.450] noise,
[00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:24.570] so
[00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:24.650] I
[00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.750] don't

[00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:26.190] so
[00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.370] there's
[00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:26.490] this

[00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:26.730] of

[00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:29.210] The
[00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.650] more

[00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:30.050] I
[00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.330] assume,
[00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.490] the

[00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:31.970] gets,
[00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:32.450] but
[00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:32.590] the
[00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:32.770] less
[00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:32.910] I

[00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:35.130] that
[00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:35.210] I'm
[00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:35.370] trying

[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:37.480] And
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:37.940] to
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:38.060] give
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:38.120] you
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:38.200] an
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:38.500] intuition
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:38.920] why
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.540] this
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.640] condition
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:40.880] number

[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:41.440] is
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:41.880] large,
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:43.820] the

[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:44.280] number
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:44.460] is
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:44.700] something
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:44.940] like
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:45.060] the
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:45.320] largest,
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:45.940] is
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:46.100] the

[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:46.740] eigenvalue
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.000] divided

[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:49.640] Now,
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.040] if
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:50.180] I
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:50.420] have

[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:57.920] right?
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.100] Because
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:58.260] the

[00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.120] matrix
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:47:59.400] are

[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:04.700] So
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:04.800] if

[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.660] has
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:12.900] a

[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:13.740] eigenvalue,
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:13.900] has
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:14.740] low
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:15.020] rank,
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:15.160] right?
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:15.720] Sorry,
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:15.920] has
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:16.320] rank
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:16.600] less
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:16.800] than
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:16.980] n.
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:17.980] And
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:18.100] if
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:18.160] it
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:18.260] has
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.660] rank
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:20.000] less
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:20.160] than
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:20.440] n,
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.140] then
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:21.340] this
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:21.740] eigenvalue
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:21.980] has

[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:22.220] be
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:22.420] zero.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:24.040] So
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:24.460] as
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:24.740] data
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:25.040] points
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:25.200] get
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:25.500] closer
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:25.680] to
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:25.840] each
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.040] other,
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:26.680] the

[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:27.260] number
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:27.420] of

[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:27.680] kernel
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:27.980] matrix
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:28.320] blows
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:28.600] up
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.280] and
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:29.480] close
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:29.600] to
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:29.740] each
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:29.880] other
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.040] is
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:30.360] relative
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:30.520] to

[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:31.220] scale.
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:32.280] So
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:32.500] if
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.080] observation
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:33.280] noise
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:33.380] is
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:33.700] small,
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:33.940] so
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:34.200] sigma
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:34.500] squared,
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:34.680] let's

[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:35.140] is
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:35.300] very

[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:35.600] to
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:35.860] zero,
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:36.740] and
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:36.820] I
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:36.960] have
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.400] close
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:37.880] data
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.220] points
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:38.680] in
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:38.860] input
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:39.240] space,
[00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:40.370] I
[00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.450] have
[00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:40.550] a
[00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.850] problem,
[00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.770] because
[00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:41.930] then
[00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:42.130] CG
[00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:42.550] converges
[00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:43.310] slowly.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:45.120] So
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:45.220] what
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:45.300] can
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:45.380] we
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:45.480] do
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:45.640] about
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:45.920] this?
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.140] The
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:47.380] answer
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:47.560] to
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:47.740] this
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:48.080] is
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.120] preconditioning.
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:50.260] So
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.240] assume
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.020] we
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:52.180] have
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:52.300] a

[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:53.540] tractable
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.420] approximation
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:54.960] P
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.140] to
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:55.260] the

[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:55.760] A,
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:55.960] so
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.080] we
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:56.240] know
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:56.720] something
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.480] about
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:57.680] this
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:57.980] matrix,
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:58.340] in
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:58.460] this
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:48:58.620] case,
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:58.740] the

[00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.200] matrix.
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:00.120] And
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:00.200] we
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:00.500] assume
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:00.880] that
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.720] the
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:02.020] storing
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:02.240] this

[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:02.760] is
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.060] rather
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:03.420] cheap
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:03.840] relative

[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:04.540] the

[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.020] A,
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:05.780] we
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:05.920] can
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.280] actually
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.400] efficiently
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.020] evaluate
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:08.220] its

[00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:10.870] pseudo

[00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:12.190] and
[00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:13.010] maybe
[00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.230] even
[00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.790] know
[00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.950] its
[00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:14.470] determinant.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:15.820] So
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:15.940] we
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:16.080] know
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:16.200] a

[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:19.600] is
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.180] we

[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:22.380] just

[00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.690] still

[00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:28.370] I
[00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.510] haven't

[00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:34.870] is
[00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:35.050] still

[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:14.820] finite
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:15.120] precision,
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:15.280] it
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:15.440] actually
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:15.620] makes
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:15.720] it
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:15.900] also
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:16.060] more
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:16.380] stable,
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:16.620] but
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:17.000] we
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:17.140] won't
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:17.300] go
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:17.440] into
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:17.640] that.
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:19.460] Okay,
[00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:21.050] so
[00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:22.230] let's
[00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.590] try
[00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:22.710] to
[00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.830] get
[00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:22.950] an
[00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:23.230] intuition
[00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:23.670] for
[00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.950] how
[00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:24.130] we
[00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:24.430] can
[00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:25.070] use
[00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:25.330] this
[00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:25.870] form
[00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:26.010] of
[00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:26.270] prior
[00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.750] information,
[00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:27.090] and
[00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:27.210] I
[00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:27.450] use
[00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:27.590] that
[00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:27.790] term
[00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:28.110] loosely,
[00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.610] next
[00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:29.230] time
[00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.350] we'll
[00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:29.530] make
[00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:29.890] it
[00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:30.490] precise,
[00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:32.290] to
[00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:32.590] quickly,
[00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:33.250] to
[00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:33.750] solve
[00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.950] linear
[00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:34.230] systems
[00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.510] quickly
[00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:34.790] for
[00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.990] GP
[00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.330] regression.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:36.960] Okay,
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:37.640] so
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:38.560] if
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:38.700] I
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:39.020] now
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:39.480] use
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:39.680] CG
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:39.860] with
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:39.960] a
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.360] preconditioner,
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:40.460] it's
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:40.620] actually
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:40.840] very
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.200] simple,
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:41.380] the
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:41.520] only
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:41.680] thing
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:41.760] I
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:41.880] have
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:41.960] to
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:42.340] change
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:42.620] is,
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:43.460] I
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:43.620] don't
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:43.860] look
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:44.020] into
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:44.160] the
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:44.520] direction
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:44.760] of
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:45.120] steepest
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:45.500] descent,
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:45.840] Ri
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.080] minus
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:46.400] one,
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:46.860] so
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.020] the
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:47.340] residual
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:47.900] negative
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:48.360] gradient,
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:49.220] but
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:49.340] I
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:49.800] slightly
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:50.660] warp
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:51.020] that
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.020] based
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:52.340] on
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:52.800] this
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.360] preconditioner.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.400] And
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:55.960] what
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.280] happens
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:56.580] is,
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:57.140] here's
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:57.480] again,
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:57.900] number
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:58.040] of
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:58.360] iterations
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:58.580] of
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.000] CG,
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:51:59.700] log
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.060] space,
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:00.780] and
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:00.920] the
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.200] error
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:01.320] in
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:01.520] A
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:01.720]-norm
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:01.920] to
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.040] the
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:02.180] true
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:02.560] solution,
[00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.570] as
[00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:04.910] I
[00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:05.990] increase
[00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.210] the
[00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:06.570] quality
[00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:06.750] of
[00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.930] my
[00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:07.490] preconditioner
[00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.730] here,
[00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:08.910] I'll
[00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:09.230] explain
[00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.370] the
[00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:09.550] type
[00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:09.670] of
[00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:10.090] preconditioner
[00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:10.110] in
[00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:10.190] a
[00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.430] moment,
[00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:11.410] you
[00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:11.490] can
[00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:11.650] see
[00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:11.930] that
[00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:12.670] I
[00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.850] actually
[00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:13.170] converge
[00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:13.550] faster,
[00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.810] the
[00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:14.030] error
[00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.490] decreases,
[00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:14.710] and
[00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.850] this
[00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:14.950] is
[00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:15.090] in
[00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:15.310] log
[00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:15.570] space,
[00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:15.910] so
[00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:16.490] I
[00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.830] need
[00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:17.270] a
[00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.570] factor,
[00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.530] two
[00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.770] orders
[00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.930] of,
[00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:19.370] sorry,
[00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:19.590] one
[00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:19.790] order
[00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:19.930] of
[00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:20.310] magnitude
[00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:20.570] fewer
[00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:20.930] iterations
[00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:21.150] for
[00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:21.290] this
[00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:21.590] problem,
[00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:22.330] as
[00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:22.550] again,
[00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:22.670] a
[00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.810] kernel
[00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:23.050] matrix.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:25.580] How
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:25.660] do
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:25.760] we
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:25.880] get
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:26.000] such
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:26.100] a
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:26.500] preconditioner?
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.060] Well,
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:28.280] we
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:28.380] can
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:28.620] actually
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:29.360] use
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:29.640] the
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:29.820] partial
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:30.260] Cholesky
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:30.460] that
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:30.600] we
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:30.840] already
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.220] introduced
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:31.460] here.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.080] So
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:32.480] one
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:32.740] way
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:32.860] to
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.300] precondition
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:33.560] kernel
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:33.840] matrices
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.460] is
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:35.020] to
[00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:36.850] approximate
[00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:39.770] the
[00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.990] kernel
[00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.290] matrix
[00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:40.690] K,
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:41.940] add
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:42.100] the
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:42.500] noise,
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:42.940] and
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:43.080] then
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:43.360] this
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:43.480] is
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:43.640] a
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:43.860] low
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.000] rank
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:44.460] approximation
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:44.860] of
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:45.100] rank
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:45.400] L,
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:45.760] I
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:45.980] just
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:46.220] run
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:46.360] the
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:46.540] partial
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:46.920] Cholesky
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.080] for
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:47.180] a
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:47.240] few
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:47.560] iterations,
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:49.260] and
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:49.500] then
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:49.940] I
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:50.100] can
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:50.300] store
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:50.480] this
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.040] thing
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:51.420] in,
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:52.440] it's
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:52.560] just
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:52.800] L
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.140] vectors
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:53.340] of

[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:53.880] N,
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:54.120] so
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:54.280] it's
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:54.420] O
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:54.500] of
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:54.860] NL,
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:55.060] which
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:55.240] is
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.060] cheap
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:56.380] compared
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:56.540] to
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:56.880] the
[00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:57.870] size
[00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.950] of
[00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:58.010] the
[00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.230] matrix,
[00:52:58.850 --> 00:52:59.190] and
[00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.370] this
[00:52:59.370 --> 00:52:59.530] is
[00:52:59.530 --> 00:52:59.710] a
[00:52:59.710 --> 00:52:59.930] low
[00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:00.290] rank
[00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:00.870] plus
[00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:01.490] diagonal
[00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.590] preconditioner,
[00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.330] so
[00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:04.810] as
[00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:04.910] you
[00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:05.070] learned
[00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:05.350] last
[00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:05.650] week,
[00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:06.210] you
[00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:06.350] can
[00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:06.690] invert
[00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:06.830] it
[00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:06.970] by
[00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:07.130] the

[00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.690] inversion
[00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:08.590] lemma,
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:09.460] so
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:09.580] you
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:09.700] can
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:10.020] also
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:10.820] compute
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:10.960] the

[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:11.940] P
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:12.240] inverse
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:12.580] here
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:13.340] very
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:13.640] quickly,
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:13.880] and
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:14.080] last
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:14.240] week
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:14.380] we
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:14.660] learned
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:15.080] that's
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:15.300] O
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:15.420] of
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:15.740] NL
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:15.980] squared,
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:16.580] so
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:17.080] even
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:17.420] linear
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:17.740] time,
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:17.880] and
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:17.980] we
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:18.080] can
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:18.340] afford
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:18.680] quadratic
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:18.940] time
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:19.140] per
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:19.420] iteration,
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:20.820] so
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:21.040] that's
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:21.240] also
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:21.380] the
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:21.820] preconditioner
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:21.880] that
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:21.980] we
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:22.180] used
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:22.320] up
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:22.480] here.
[00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.450] It's
[00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:49.610] true,
[00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:50.190] so
[00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.410] you
[00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:50.630] could
[00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.950] even
[00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:51.330] construct
[00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:51.530] an

[00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:51.970] better
[00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:52.670] preconditioner
[00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:53.170] by
[00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:53.650] selecting
[00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:53.930] better
[00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:54.130] data
[00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:54.490] points,
[00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:55.130] very
[00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.470] true,
[00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:56.010] but
[00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:56.030] it
[00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.150] turns
[00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.330] out
[00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:56.630] even
[00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:57.130] doing
[00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:57.270] a
[00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.410] very
[00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:57.610] dumb
[00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:57.970] strategy,
[00:53:58.090 --> 00:53:58.190] just
[00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.510] randomly
[00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.970] sampling
[00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:59.530] really
[00:53:59.530 --> 00:53:59.970] accelerates
[00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:00.130] my
[00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:00.410] method,
[00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:01.210] and
[00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:01.310] the
[00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:01.450] issue
[00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:01.590] is
[00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:01.730] if
[00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.830] I
[00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:01.930] would
[00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:02.110] just
[00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:02.290] run
[00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:02.550] CG
[00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:02.930] without
[00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.630] preconditioning,
[00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:04.550] it
[00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:04.810] doesn't
[00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:05.090] converge
[00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:05.210] as
[00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.510] fast
[00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.850] because
[00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:05.910] of
[00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.990] the
[00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.210] convergence
[00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:06.590] statement,
[00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:07.170] so
[00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:07.470] somehow
[00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.730] that's
[00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.830] a
[00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:07.950] really
[00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:08.130] good
[00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:08.490] method,
[00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.870] but
[00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.950] we
[00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:09.070] have
[00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:09.170] to
[00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.350] warm
[00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:09.630] start
[00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.730] it
[00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:09.890] maybe
[00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:10.010] a
[00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.130] little
[00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.330] bit
[00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:10.550] to
[00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:10.710] get
[00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.850] that
[00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:11.150] benefit,
[00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:12.070] that's
[00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:12.190] kind
[00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.250] of
[00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:12.330] the
[00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:12.590] intuition.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:14.680] So
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.080] now
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:15.360] let's
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:15.560] try
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:15.740] that
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:15.940] out,
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:16.620] here's

[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.020] promised

[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:19.960] going
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:20.180] to

[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:29.620] Here's

[00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:46.250] I
[00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.510] run
[00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:47.070] the
[00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:47.450] precondition
[00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.890] Cholesky,
[00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.970] and
[00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:49.110] what
[00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:49.230] you
[00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.430] see
[00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.730] is
[00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:50.330] that
[00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:50.890] the
[00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:51.350] residual
[00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:52.870] converges
[00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:53.070] to
[00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:53.290] about
[00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:53.950] 10
[00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:54.050] to
[00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:54.110] the
[00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:54.310] minus
[00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:54.470] 8,
[00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:54.610] 10
[00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:54.690] to
[00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:54.730] the
[00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:54.890] minus
[00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:55.310] 9
[00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:55.790] in
[00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:56.070] 60
[00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:56.450] iterations.
[00:54:58.290 --> 00:54:58.730] So
[00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:59.030] actually,
[00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.710] we
[00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.830] could
[00:54:59.830 --> 00:54:59.910] have
[00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:00.250] stopped
[00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:00.470] this
[00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.690] even
[00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:01.110] earlier,
[00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:01.990] maybe
[00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.130] in
[00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:02.290] about
[00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:02.510] three
[00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.830] minutes,
[00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:03.470] and
[00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.570] would
[00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:03.670] have
[00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.830] gotten
[00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:03.950] a
[00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:04.130] very
[00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.370] accurate
[00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.770] solution.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:06.520] Now,
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:06.640] one
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:06.860] quick
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:07.160] side
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:07.420] note,
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:07.800] I'm
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:07.940] not
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:08.320] showing
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:08.700] the
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.300] error
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:09.480] in
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:09.660] A
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:09.880] norm
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.180] here,
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.000] because
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:11.100] I
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:11.180] would
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:11.300] have
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:11.420] to
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:11.680] compute
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:11.880] the
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.060] exact
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:12.460] solution,
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:12.860] but
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:12.940] I
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:13.100] can't
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:13.180] do
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:13.420] that,
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:14.320] because
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:14.420] the
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:14.580] system
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:14.720] is
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:14.820] too
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:15.060] large.
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:16.100] So
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:16.200] I
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:16.300] can
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:16.440] only
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:16.640] show
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:16.720] you
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:16.840] the
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:17.100] residual
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:17.380] norm,
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:17.860] but
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:18.100] that's
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:18.300] the
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:18.620] proxy
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:18.800] that
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:18.920] we
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:19.140] use
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:19.280] to
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:19.680] track
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.020] how
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:20.280] accurate
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:20.440] we
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:20.600] are,
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.120] and
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:21.220] the
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:21.460] residual
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:21.800] norm
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.080] is
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:22.940] almost
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:23.200] the
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:23.400] same
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:23.620] thing
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:23.760] as
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:23.880] the
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:24.020] error
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:24.140] in
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:24.280] A
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:24.520] norm,
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:25.060] it's
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:25.180] the
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:25.340] error
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:25.520] in
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:25.680] A

[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.180] A
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:26.340] norm.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:28.880] So
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:28.960] you
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:29.060] can
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:29.240] see
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:29.580] that,
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:30.320] I
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:30.420] can
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:30.600] now
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:30.880] do,
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:31.300] I
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:31.420] can
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:31.800] compute
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.020] a

[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:35.500] point
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:35.680] data
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.020] set
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:36.880] in
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:37.580] maybe
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:37.880] seven
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:38.140] minutes
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:38.320] on

[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:38.960] machine
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:39.200] upstairs.
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:42.000] Now,
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:42.580] you
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:42.720] might
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.040] ask,
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:43.540] well,
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.160] I
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:44.340] have
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:44.440] to
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:44.560] do
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:44.720] more

[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.140] one
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:45.540] solve,
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:45.800] right?
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:45.880] Do
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:45.880] I
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.000] have
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:46.260] to
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:47.220] maybe,
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:47.820] during
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:48.260] hyperparameter
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:48.800] optimization,
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.020] do
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:49.360] multiple
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:49.760] solves?
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:50.840] Actually,
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:51.680] you
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:51.880] might
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:52.040] be

[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.160] to

[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.160] preconditioners
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:55.300] for
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:55.500] this,
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:55.680] or
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:55.800] if
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:55.880] you
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.080] actually
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:56.220] have
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:56.480] multiple
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:56.920] systems
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.060] that
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:57.160] you
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:57.280] need
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:57.420] to
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:57.740] solve,
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.060] this
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:58.360] cost
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:58.600] also
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.060] amortizes,
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:55:59.320] because
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:55:59.440] you
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:55:59.580] only
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:55:59.720] have
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:55:59.820] to
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:00.020] compute
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:00.160] the
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:00.600] preconditioner
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:00.860] once.
[00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:05.830] But
[00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:06.010] what
[00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:06.190] about
[00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:06.690] hyperparameter
[00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:07.010] optimization?
[00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:07.270] I've
[00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.430] only
[00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.690] told

[00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:07.910] how
[00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:08.030] to

[00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.390] linear

[00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:08.870] I
[00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:09.010] haven't

[00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:09.970] about
[00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:10.510] how
[00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.630] we
[00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.810] actually

[00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:11.410] hyperparameter
[00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:11.890] optimization.
[00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.430] For
[00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:12.890] Cholesky,
[00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.470] Marvin
[00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.770] told
[00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:13.910] you
[00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:14.050] they
[00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:14.150] can
[00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.310] just
[00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:14.770] compute

[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:23.960] How

[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:24.140] we

[00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.770] We
[00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:27.970] need
[00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:28.270] to,
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:29.740] remember,
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:31.160] we
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:31.340] need,
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:31.600] want

[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:33.320] want

[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:35.600] like
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:35.720] the

[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:36.160] scale,
[00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:37.350] to
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.380] optimize
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:39.580] the

[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.120] marginal
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:40.520] likelihood,
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:40.980] that's
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:41.100] our

[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:42.440] function.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:43.460] So
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:43.600] we
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:43.720] need
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:43.840] to
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:44.200] evaluate
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:44.420] the

[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:46.200] good
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:46.340] we
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:46.520] are,
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:47.720] and
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.460] most
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:48.820] importantly,
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:49.140] we
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:49.440] need
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:49.560] to
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:49.900] compute
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:50.200] its
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:50.640] gradient
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.060] so
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:51.180] we
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:51.300] can
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:51.520] actually
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:52.000] optimize
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:52.240] with
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:52.340] a

[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:52.760]-based
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.280] optimizer.
[00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:54.450] So
[00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:54.530] it
[00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:54.650] turns
[00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:54.770] out

[00:56:57.810 --> 00:56:58.270] here,
[00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.690] remember,
[00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.090] it
[00:56:59.090 --> 00:56:59.190] has

[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:04.720] If
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:04.780] I
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:04.940] take

[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.000] so
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:11.480] that's,
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:11.720] again,
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:12.020] two

[00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:25.810] So
[00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:26.270] we
[00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.370] have
[00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:26.610] two

[00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:30.230] We

[00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:46.910] We

[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.140] What
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:56.220] do
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:56.280] we
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:56.400] do
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:56.580] about
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:56.800] these
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.020] things?
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:58.340] We
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:58.540] also
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:58.680] have
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:58.780] to
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:57:59.000] compute
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:57:59.480] traces.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:00.340] Arguably
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:00.600] maybe
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:00.780] we
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:00.880] could
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:01.100] say
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:01.240] we
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:01.360] can
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:01.500] get
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:01.680] away
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:01.840] with
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:02.040] not
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:02.460] evaluating
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:02.660] the
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:02.820] log
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:03.040] marginal
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:03.360] likelihood
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:03.560] and
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:03.740] just
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:04.700] terminate
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:04.860] when
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:05.040] our
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:05.500] gradients
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:05.920] are
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.520] vanishing,
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:07.120] maybe
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:07.340] that's
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:07.560] fine,
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:08.240] but
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:08.360] that
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:08.580] still
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:08.900] involves
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:09.040] a
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.340] trace
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:09.700] of
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:09.800] a
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:09.940] linear
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:10.180] system
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:10.420] solve.
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:13.280] Now
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:13.840] how
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:13.920] do
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.040] we
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:14.480] compute
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:14.960] these
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:15.240] traces?
[00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.670] Let's
[00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.770] take
[00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.870] a
[00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.990] step
[00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.230] back
[00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:19.350] and
[00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:19.470] look
[00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.530] at
[00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:19.630] the
[00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.970] definition.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:21.100] So
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:21.620] the
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:21.840] trace
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:21.940] of
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:22.060] a
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:22.300] matrix
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:23.120] is
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:23.720] the
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:23.940] sum
[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:24.080] of
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:24.220] its
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:24.620] diagonal,
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:26.040] so
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:26.200] the
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:26.400] sum
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:26.560] over
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:26.680] the
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:26.940] diagonal
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:27.380] elements
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:27.840] aii.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:29.900] One
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:30.180] way
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:30.600] I
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:30.740] could
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.040] write
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:31.280] this
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:31.580] using
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:31.860] matrix
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:32.120] vector
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:32.480] multiplication
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:32.860] is
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:33.060] just
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.460] multiply
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:33.680] from
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:33.840] the
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:34.020] left
[00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:34.140] and
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:34.360] right
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:34.520] with
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:34.740] unit
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:35.120] vectors
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:35.700] that
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:36.220] select
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.220] the
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:37.560] diagonal
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:37.980] element.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.400] Actually
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:42.620] it's
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:42.840] also
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:43.180] equivalent
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:43.600] to
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:44.080] the
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:44.440] sum
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.060] of
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:45.200] the
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:45.640] eigenvalues,
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:45.880] but
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:46.640] this
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:46.780] is
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:46.980] the
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:47.580] thing
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:47.700] that
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:47.780] we
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:47.900] all
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:48.000] want
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:48.080] to
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:48.200] look
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:48.280] at
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:48.380] for
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:48.540] now.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:49.640] But
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:49.760] our
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.020] problem
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:50.300] is
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.320] we
[00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:51.810] can't
[00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:52.710] afford
[00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:53.150] cubic
[00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.630] computation,
[00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.850] we
[00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:54.070] can't
[00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:54.350] afford
[00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:54.770] n
[00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:55.370] matrix
[00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.690] vector
[00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:56.270] multiplies
[00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.530] because
[00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:56.750] that
[00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.890] would
[00:58:56.890 --> 00:58:57.150] be
[00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.590] n
[00:58:57.590 --> 00:58:57.830] times
[00:58:57.830 --> 00:58:58.010] n
[00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.250] squared
[00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.590] cubic.
[00:58:58.590 --> 00:58:59.550] We
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.140] want
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:00.480] to
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.420] ideally
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:02.080] approximate
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:02.320] this
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:02.480] thing
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:02.600] to
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:02.820] high
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:03.280] accuracy
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.320] with
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.140] l
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:05.900] much
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:06.380] fewer
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:06.820] than
[00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:07.260] n
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:08.180] matrix
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:08.440] vector
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:08.900] multiplies.
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:09.120] Because
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:09.220] if
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:09.280] we
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:09.360] can
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:09.500] do
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:09.800] that,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:10.120] we
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:10.240] can
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:10.500] solve
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:10.680] linear
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:11.100] systems
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:11.420] with

[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.040] i,
[00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.430] and
[00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:14.690] we
[00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.810] can
[00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:15.070] compute
[00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:15.550] traces
[00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:15.870] with

[00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:16.490] of

[00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:17.110] l,
[00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:18.110] and
[00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:18.470] hopefully
[00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.710] i
[00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.870] plus
[00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:19.030] l
[00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.130] is
[00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:19.310] much
[00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:19.530] smaller
[00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:19.690] than
[00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:19.990] n,
[00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:20.810] then
[00:59:20.810 --> 00:59:20.990] we
[00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.310] found
[00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:21.650] a
[00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.890] method
[00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:22.210] that
[00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:22.870] approximates
[00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:23.150] Gauss
[00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.490] process
[00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:23.850] regression
[00:59:23.850 --> 00:59:24.230] in
[00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.470] quadratic
[00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.930] time
[00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:25.590] on
[00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:25.810] very
[00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:26.050] large
[00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:26.270] scale
[00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.470] data
[00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.750] sets
[00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:27.030] as
[00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.150] we
[00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.310] just
[00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:27.510] saw.
[00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.810] So
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:30.760] let's
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:31.440] make
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:31.520] an
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:31.940] observation
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:32.660] about
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:32.980] this
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.040] trace
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:34.260] of
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:34.340] a
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:34.680] matrix.
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.040] Say
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:36.160] we
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:36.300] had

[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:30.540] Then

[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:47.740] If

[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.040] just

[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.100] And
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:52.340] that's

[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:05.740] time.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:05.860] I
[01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:06.000] can
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.300] do
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:06.360] it
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:06.520] really
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:06.840] fast
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:06.940] on
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:07.040] a
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:07.320] computer.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:08.700] And
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:08.940] hopefully
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.100] I
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:09.260] only
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:09.480] need
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:09.600] a
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:09.800] small
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.040] number
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:10.220] of
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:10.360] these
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:10.560] random
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:10.780] vectors.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.040] But
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:14.520] I
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:14.900] don't
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.080] need
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:15.180] a
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:15.360] small
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:15.620] number
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:15.800] of
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:15.980] random
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.220] vectors.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:18.280] Here
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:18.620] is
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:19.640] a
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.040] plot
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:20.560] that
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:20.820] shows
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:20.960] the
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.140] number
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:21.280] of
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:21.480] random
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:21.780] vectors
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:21.980] on
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.100] the
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:22.300] x
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:22.600]-axis
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.740] for
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:24.740] the

[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:25.480] of
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:25.600] the
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:25.740] log
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.120] determinant.
[01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:28.750] Now
[01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:29.210] remember
[01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.550] last
[01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:29.930] time,
[01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:30.390] you
[01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.650] saw
[01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.850] that
[01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:30.990] you
[01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:31.150] can
[01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.490] rewrite
[01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.690] the
[01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:31.870] log
[01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:32.250] determinant
[01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:32.530] as
[01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:32.650] a
[01:03:32.650 --> 01:03:33.010] trace.
[01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.890] I'll
[01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:34.090] show
[01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:34.210] you
[01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:34.350] that
[01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:34.570] again
[01:03:34.570 --> 01:03:34.790] one
[01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:35.090] second
[01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:35.370] here.
[01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:36.130] The
[01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:36.330] log
[01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:36.630] determinant
[01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.810] of
[01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:36.910] the
[01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:37.090] kernel
[01:03:37.090 --> 01:03:37.510] matrix,
[01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.910] you
[01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:38.090] can
[01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:38.470] rewrite
[01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.770] as
[01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:38.910] the
[01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:39.290] trace
[01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:39.950] of
[01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:40.130] the
[01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.490] matrix
[01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:41.050] logarithm
[01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:41.250] of

[01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:41.470] kernel
[01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.830] matrix.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:43.720] So
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.080] if
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:44.220] I
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:44.380] could
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:44.840] evaluate
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.200] the
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:45.600] logarithm
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.060] of
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:46.200] the
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:46.360] kernel
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:46.640] matrix,
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:47.180] I
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:47.280] could
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:47.440] just
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:47.580] do
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:47.740] this

[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:48.440] estimation
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.460] strategy
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:49.760] that
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:49.840] we
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.020] just
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:50.380] outlined.
[01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.730] Let's
[01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:53.990] assume
[01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.150] we
[01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.250] can
[01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:54.450] just
[01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:54.730] compute
[01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:54.930] this
[01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:55.230] function
[01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:55.390] of
[01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:55.470] a
[01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:55.610] kernel
[01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:55.970] matrix
[01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:56.130] for
[01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:56.310] us.
[01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:56.470] It's
[01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.690] always
[01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:57.410] the
[01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:57.710] log
[01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.990] if
[01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.110] you
[01:03:58.110 --> 01:03:58.370] care
[01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.510] about
[01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.630] the
[01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.770] log
[01:03:58.770 --> 01:03:59.110] determinant,
[01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:00.310] and
[01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:01.070] not
[01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:01.490] care
[01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.670] so
[01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.830] much
[01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:02.050] that
[01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:02.310] we
[01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:02.490] also
[01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:02.630] have
[01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.690] to
[01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.970] estimate
[01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:03.110] this

[01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:03.290] the
[01:04:03.290 --> 01:04:03.430] middle.
[01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:03.730] Let's
[01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:03.850] just
[01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:04.010] say
[01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:04.250] we
[01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:04.570] can't
[01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:04.650] do
[01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:04.830] that.
[01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.850] And
[01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:05.970] what
[01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:06.170] you'll
[01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.430] find
[01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.710] is
[01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:07.370] here
[01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.570] if
[01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:07.810] I
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.480] look
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:09.560] at

[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:11.000] take

[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:18.840] You

[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:19.100] see
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:19.360] that
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.140] I'm
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:20.940] qualitatively
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.180] pretty

[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:25.660] And
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:26.640] I
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:26.980] literally
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:27.400] need

[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.040] and
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:30.180] this
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:30.300] is
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:30.560] actually

[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:32.780] So
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.100] I
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.340] found
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:34.500] a
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:34.820] strategy
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.120] to
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:35.380] solve
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:35.600] my
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.220] problem
[01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:36.700] that
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:36.820] is
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:36.960] just
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.080] as
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:37.440] expensive
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:37.660] as
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:38.060] Cholesky,
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:38.580] which
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:38.700] I
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:38.900] can't
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:39.020] do
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:39.140] on
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:39.320] large
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:39.480] data
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:39.740] sets.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.040] So
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.320] crap.
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:42.060] What
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:42.140] do
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:42.240] I
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:42.440] do?
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:43.520] Well,
[01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:44.590] this
[01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:44.690] is
[01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.830] a
[01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:45.130] property
[01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:45.430] of
[01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.690] Monte
[01:04:45.690 --> 01:04:45.850] Carlo
[01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:46.430] estimators
[01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:47.130] that
[01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:47.430] they
[01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.630] just
[01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:48.070] converge
[01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:48.350] at
[01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:48.850] this
[01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:49.470] rather
[01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.730] slow
[01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:50.030] speed,
[01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:50.210] one
[01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.350] over
[01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:50.470] the
[01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.670] square
[01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:50.790] root
[01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:50.890] of
[01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:50.990] the
[01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.210] number
[01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:51.370] of
[01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:51.590] random
[01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:51.950] vectors
[01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:52.210] or
[01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:52.950] random
[01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:53.310] samples.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.260] This
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:55.460] is
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:55.600] going
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:55.780] to
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:56.020] be
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:56.160] an
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:56.420] issue
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:56.700] because
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:56.820] it
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.020] really
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:57.300] slows
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:57.500] down
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:57.640] my
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.040] hyperparameter
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:58.520] optimization,
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:04:58.760] and
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:58.860] I
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:04:59.020] just
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:04:59.300] simply
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:04:59.540] can't
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:04:59.720] afford
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:04:59.860] to
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:04:59.960] do
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.220] that.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:01.460] So
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:01.580] what
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:01.840] can
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:01.980] you
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:02.220] do?
[01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:04.510] You
[01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.750] can,
[01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:05.390] again,
[01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:06.170] use
[01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.450] something
[01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:06.610] that
[01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:06.710] we
[01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.890] already
[01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:07.170] know.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:08.860] We
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:09.060] have
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:09.180] a
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:09.860] preconditioner
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:10.240] for
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:10.460] our
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:10.700] linear
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:11.040] system
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:11.440] solve,
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:11.720] so
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:11.840] we
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:12.200] know
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:12.560] something
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:12.860] about
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:13.540] approximately
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:13.840] how
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:14.000] the
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:14.180] kernel
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:14.460] matrix
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:14.680] looks
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.000] like,
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:16.940] and
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:17.100] it's
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:17.440] inverse.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.060] Can
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:18.180] we
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:18.420] use
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:18.660] that
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:18.900] to
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.200] solve
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:19.400] this
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:19.660] issue
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:19.860] here?
[01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:21.030] You
[01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:21.130] can
[01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:21.270] do
[01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.650] that
[01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:22.150] by,
[01:05:22.610 --> 01:05:22.710] if
[01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.770] you
[01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:22.930] look
[01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:23.010] at
[01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:23.130] the
[01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:23.290] log
[01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:23.710] determinant,
[01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.930] you
[01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:25.050] can
[01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:25.470] introduce
[01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.650] a
[01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:25.950] one
[01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:26.510] identity
[01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.850] matrix
[01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:27.190] by
[01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.510] just
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.540] introducing
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:28.740] the
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:29.420] preconditioner.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:29.760] You
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:29.840] can
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.020] think
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:30.100] of
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:30.200] a
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:30.360] partial
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:30.740] Cholesky
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:30.900] here
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:31.000] if
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:31.060] you
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:31.260] want,
[01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:32.510] and
[01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.650] it's
[01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:32.930] inverse.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.060] And
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:34.300] then
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.420] using
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:35.680] the
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:35.960] rules
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:36.100] of
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:36.240] the

[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.020] logarithm,
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:37.300] I
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:37.440] can
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:37.760] pull
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.060] out
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:38.900] this

[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.300] preconditioner.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:40.720] And
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:40.820] we
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.120] assume
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:41.280] that
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:41.380] that

[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:41.880] known,
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:42.300] so
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:42.460] we
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:42.580] have
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:42.840] some

[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:43.280] about

[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:45.900] already
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:46.160] know.
[01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:47.630] And
[01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.730] then
[01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:47.830] I
[01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:47.910] get
[01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:48.030] a

[01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:48.790] here,
[01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:49.210] again,
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:50.620] that's
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:50.860] something
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:51.300] like
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.220] the

[01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:52.870] of

[01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:54.890] logarithms.
[01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:55.790] And
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.000] you
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:56.120] can
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:56.320] already
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:56.600] see
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:56.780] that
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:56.980] if

[01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:58.540] hat
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.700] gets

[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:01.400] becomes
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:01.680] very
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.160] insignificant.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:03.200] And
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:03.440] my

[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.320] determinant

[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:47.460] uses
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:47.640] this
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.580] preconditioned

[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:56.180] And
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:56.360] with
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:56.660] that,
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.000] you
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:58.340] can
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.200] scale
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:07:59.980] to
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:00.200] data
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:00.500] sets.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:00.720] These
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:00.820] are
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:01.020] all
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:01.240] data
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:01.420] sets
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:01.540] on

[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:04.060] repository.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:04.360] I
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:04.520] think
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:04.880] some
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:04.980] of
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.080] them
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:05.160] are
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:05.400] not,
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:05.600] but
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.100] they
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:07.280] have
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:07.480] data
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:07.720] set
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.800] sizes
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.300] between

[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.240],000
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:10.700] and
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:10.980] a
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:11.160] million
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:11.420] data
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:11.640] points
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:11.800] here.
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:13.060] And
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:13.180] now,
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:13.340] this
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:13.440] is
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:13.540] on
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:13.640] a
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:13.940] GPU
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:14.460] because
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.420] even
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:16.360] matrix
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:16.600] vector
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.240] multiplies
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:17.840] get
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:18.300] significantly
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:18.720] difficult
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.320] if
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.860] your
[01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:21.110] system
[01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.230] is
[01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:21.350] just
[01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:21.550] large
[01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.750] enough,
[01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:21.910] but
[01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:22.010] you
[01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.130] can
[01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.610] parallelize
[01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.710] them
[01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:22.970] easily.
[01:08:23.530 --> 01:08:23.830] So
[01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:24.370] with
[01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:24.530] these
[01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.970] strategies
[01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:25.190] that
[01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:25.290] we
[01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:25.510] just
[01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:26.010] showed
[01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:26.270] you,
[01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:27.090] you
[01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:27.450] can,
[01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.630] within
[01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:30.050] about
[01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.230] an
[01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:30.570] hour,
[01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:31.110] train
[01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.510] on
[01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:32.050] a
[01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:32.170] data
[01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:32.350] set
[01:08:32.350 --> 01:08:32.510] with
[01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.790] roughly
[01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:33.550] 250
[01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.790],000,
[01:08:33.790 --> 01:08:34.190] 280
[01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:34.510],000
[01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.690] data
[01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:35.050] points
[01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:35.950] and
[01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:36.210] up
[01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:36.470] to
[01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.690] a
[01:08:36.690 --> 01:08:37.010] day
[01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:37.410] for
[01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:37.550] a
[01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.710] million
[01:08:37.710 --> 01:08:37.910] data
[01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:38.210] points
[01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:38.510] if
[01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.610] you
[01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:38.910] have
[01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:39.630] GPUs
[01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.870] available.
[01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:41.650] And
[01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:42.030] internally,
[01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:42.630] that
[01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.830] works
[01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:43.230] exactly
[01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:43.430] how
[01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.550] I
[01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.670] just
[01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:43.870] showed
[01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:44.010] you.
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:45.360] Now,
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:45.800] just
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.160] to
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:46.580] give
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:46.680] you
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:46.840] a
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.140] notice
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:47.320] about
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:47.500] what
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:47.720] pre
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:47.940]-training
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:48.060] and
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:48.180] not
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:48.360] pre
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:48.560]-training
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:48.820] is,
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:49.500] pre
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:49.740]-training
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:49.900] is
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:50.240] just
[01:08:50.790 --> 01:08:51.850] sample
[01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:52.010] a
[01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:52.230] small
[01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:52.450] data
[01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:52.690] set
[01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:52.910] of
[01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:53.050] the
[01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:53.210] data
[01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:53.370] set
[01:08:53.370 --> 01:08:53.510] that
[01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.610] you're
[01:08:53.610 --> 01:08:53.830] training
[01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:54.130] on
[01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:54.670] to
[01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:54.910] get
[01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:55.850] hyperparameters
[01:08:55.850 --> 01:08:56.010] that
[01:08:56.010 --> 01:08:56.110] are
[01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:56.530] approximately
[01:08:56.530 --> 01:08:56.950] good
[01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:57.210] and
[01:08:57.210 --> 01:08:57.350] then
[01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:57.710] start
[01:08:57.710 --> 01:08:57.890] from
[01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:58.110] there,
[01:08:58.250 --> 01:08:58.450] start
[01:08:58.450 --> 01:08:58.730] optimizing
[01:08:58.730 --> 01:08:59.010] from
[01:08:59.010 --> 01:08:59.190] there.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:13.560] So
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.680] the
[01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.850] question
[01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:16.190] was,
[01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:17.710] can
[01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:17.830] I
[01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:18.230] explain
[01:09:18.230 --> 01:09:18.690] again
[01:09:18.690 --> 01:09:19.350] how
[01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:20.450] essentially
[01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.770] this
[01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:21.070] part,
[01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:21.290] right?
[01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.910] Why
[01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:22.550] do
[01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.650] we
[01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:22.810] get
[01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:23.070] this
[01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:23.510] increase
[01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.610] in
[01:09:23.610 --> 01:09:23.710] the
[01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:23.890] rate?
[01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.210] So
[01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:25.630] clearly,
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:26.380] if
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:26.820] the
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:27.540] preconditioner,
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:28.420] if
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:28.540] it's
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:28.620] a
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:28.760] low
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:28.880]-rank
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.400] preconditioner,
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:29.540] it
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:29.900] depends
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:30.140] on
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:30.540] the
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:30.780] rank
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:31.020] L
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:31.160] of
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:31.280] the
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:31.420] low
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:31.520]-rank
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:31.800] part.
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:32.420] If
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:32.580] that
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:32.760] gets
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:33.120] close
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:33.300] to
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:33.460] k
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:33.720] hat,
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.120] this
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:34.380] part
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:34.640] goes
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:34.780] to
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:35.000] 0,
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:35.360] right?
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:36.980] But
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:37.440] to
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:37.620] actually
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:37.880] figure
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.120] out
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:38.500] how
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:39.240] good
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:39.360] our
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:39.680] estimate
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.000] is,
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:40.280] it
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:40.420] turns
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:40.560] out
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:40.860] this
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:41.940] contribution
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:42.480] depends
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:42.740] on
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:42.980] how
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:43.400] quickly
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:43.800] the
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.420] preconditioner
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:44.740] converges
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:44.860] to
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:44.980] the
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.100] kernel
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:45.380] matrix.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:45.880] You
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:45.960] can
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:46.260] imagine
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:46.520] that
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.340] you
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:47.480] need
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:47.580] to
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:47.920] take
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.040] a
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:48.160] lot
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:48.300] of

[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:49.420] get
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:49.540] a
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:49.740] good
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.040] estimate
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:50.200] of
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:50.300] the
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:50.420] kernel
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:50.740] matrix.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:51.540] Then
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:51.660] that
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:51.780] would
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:51.940] not
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:52.120] help
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:52.220] you
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:52.380] very
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:52.580] much
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:52.780] because
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:52.880] it's
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.020] very
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:53.300] costly
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:53.500] to
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:53.620] do
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:53.780] that.
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:54.920] If
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.100] this
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:55.280] thing
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:55.660] converges
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:55.940] very,
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:56.120] very
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:56.520] quickly
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:56.940] to
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:57.080] the

[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:57.520] matrix,
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:57.680] you
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:57.820] can
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.280] invest
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:58.540] a
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:09:58.680] very
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.000] small

[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:03.760] quicker
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.140] convergence
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:04.520] strategy,
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.020] OK?
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:05.900] And
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.020] it
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:06.160] turns
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:06.300] out
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:06.500] that
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.400] typically,
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:07.660] you
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:07.940] know
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:08.280] something
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:08.560] about
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:08.780] how
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.080] fast
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:09.220] your
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:09.700] preconditioner
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:10.080] converges.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.120] And
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:11.520] you
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.100] inherit
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:13.360] this
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:13.600] rate
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.140] specifically
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:14.560] also
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:14.720] for
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:14.820] the
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:14.980] Monte
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:15.160] Carlo
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:15.500] estimate.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:15.760] So
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:15.980] instead
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:16.160] of
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:16.380] 1
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:16.560] over
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:16.840] square
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.060] root
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:17.160] of
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:17.260] the
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:17.440] number
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:17.560] of
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:17.740] random
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:18.040] vectors,
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:18.200] you
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:18.560] converge
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:18.780] with
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:18.920] a
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.140] speed
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:19.260] up
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:19.560] that's
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.000] polynomial,
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:20.400] sometimes
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:20.640] even
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:20.980] exponential.
[01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:22.790] And
[01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:23.230] what
[01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:23.370] that
[01:10:23.370 --> 01:10:23.590] means
[01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.910] is
[01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:25.230] you
[01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:25.510] converge
[01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.630] to
[01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:25.730] the
[01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:25.870] true
[01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:26.190] value
[01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:26.810] much,
[01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:26.950] much,
[01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:27.070] much
[01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.350] faster.
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.220] OK,
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:31.580] so
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.320] now
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:32.500] you
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:32.860] know
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:33.540] how
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:34.320] you
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:34.420] can
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:34.600] do
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:34.920] this
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.860] large
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:36.240] scale
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.620] with
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.360] iterative
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:38.980] approaches.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:40.700] You
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:40.820] can
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.080] scale
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:41.340] Gaussian
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:41.700] processes
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:41.900] to
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.060] large
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:42.220] data
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:42.440] sets.
[01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:44.250] Let's
[01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:44.350] do
[01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:44.490] a
[01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:44.810] quick
[01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:45.630] recap
[01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:45.830] of
[01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:46.530] observations
[01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:46.870] before
[01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:47.050] we
[01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:47.230] move
[01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:47.330] to
[01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.470] the
[01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.630] final
[01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.910] part.
[01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.970] So
[01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:50.350] you've
[01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.510] seen
[01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.750] that
[01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.930] we
[01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:51.050] kind
[01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.110] of

[01:10:53.410 --> 01:10:53.750] choose
[01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.970] these

[01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:54.350] called
[01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.790] actions,
[01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:54.970] which
[01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:55.050] are
[01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:55.410] vectors,
[01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:56.330] that
[01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:56.630] essentially
[01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:57.230] determine
[01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:58.410] how
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:58.660] to
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:10:59.180] observe

[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:01.340] in
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:01.480] our
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:01.820] case.
[01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:04.530] This
[01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:04.910] choice
[01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:05.070] of

[01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:07.050] through
[01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:07.190] the

[01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:07.630] vector
[01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:08.030] multiply
[01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.970] really
[01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:09.530] affects

[01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:10.330] fast
[01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:10.450] we
[01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:10.850] converge,
[01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.930] OK?
[01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:12.110] You
[01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.270] saw
[01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.510] that
[01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.770] because
[01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:13.170] CG,
[01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:14.150] which
[01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:14.290] used
[01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:14.370] a

[01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.650] And

[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:21.120] If

[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:30.380] So

[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:55.280] But

[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:00.500] set?
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:01.020] So
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.120] our
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:02.380] inference
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:02.680] method
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.100] scales
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:03.460] not
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.440] with
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:04.520] the
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:04.720] problem
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.000] size
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:05.760] to
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:05.860] the
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:06.000] power
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:06.140] of
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:06.400] 2,
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.000] but
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:07.260] just
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:07.520] the
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:07.920] problem
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.120] size
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:08.440] itself.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.000] So
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:12.520] this
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:12.780] idea
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:12.900] is
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.100] actually
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:13.260] a
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:13.340] little
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:13.520] bit
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:13.860] older
[01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:14.720] than
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:15.180] the
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:15.700] iterative
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.180] methods
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:16.680] approach.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:18.440] Not
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:18.580] the
[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:18.840] specific
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:19.140] idea,
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:19.320] but
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:19.460] the
[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:19.620] idea
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:19.740] of
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:19.960] linear
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.180] time
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:20.360] GP
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:20.760] inference.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:21.560] And
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:21.680] I'll
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:21.840] show
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:21.960] you
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:22.160] the
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:22.400] most
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:22.720] modern
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.080] version
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:23.280] of
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:23.380] it.
[01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:25.330] And
[01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:25.650] here,
[01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.950] again,
[01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:26.230] this
[01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:26.330] is
[01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.470] just
[01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.590] to
[01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.730] give
[01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:26.870] you
[01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:27.230] a
[01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:27.350] kind
[01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.430] of
[01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.530] a
[01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:27.850] slight
[01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:28.190] quick
[01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:28.570] overview.
[01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:29.470] We
[01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:29.650] won't
[01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:29.810] go
[01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:30.030] too
[01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.230] deep
[01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:30.390] into
[01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.710] this.
[01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:33.250] So
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.020] one
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:34.360] observation
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:34.620] you
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:34.740] can
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.000] make
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:35.300] about
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:35.940] any
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:36.180] data
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:36.420] set,
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:36.860] basically,
[01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:39.290] specifically
[01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:39.550] if
[01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:39.610] they're
[01:13:39.610 --> 01:13:39.770] low
[01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:40.110] dimensional,
[01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:41.270] that
[01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:42.110] the
[01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.670] data
[01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:42.990] points
[01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.290] in
[01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:43.530] them
[01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:44.030] are
[01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.290] often
[01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:44.550] quite
[01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.870] similar.
[01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:45.390] You
[01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.610] often
[01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:45.790] have
[01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:46.090] data
[01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:46.430] points
[01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.570] that
[01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:46.670] are
[01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:46.890] quite
[01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:47.190] redundant.
[01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:47.370] You
[01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:47.490] get
[01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:47.730] training
[01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:48.230] examples
[01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:48.470] where
[01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.670] the
[01:13:48.670 --> 01:13:48.970] example
[01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:49.130] that
[01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.250] you
[01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.450] get
[01:13:49.450 --> 01:13:49.610] is
[01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.810] similar
[01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:49.990] to
[01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.110] one
[01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.230] that
[01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:50.370] you've
[01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:50.470] seen
[01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.830] previously.
[01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:52.490] Now,
[01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.630] wouldn't
[01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.730] it
[01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:52.870] be
[01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:53.250] great
[01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:54.450] if
[01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:54.550] we
[01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.710] could
[01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:55.250] compress
[01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:55.490] that
[01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:55.830] data
[01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:56.350] into
[01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:56.570] a
[01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:57.050] smaller
[01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:58.050] training
[01:13:58.050 --> 01:13:58.250] data
[01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:58.550] set?
[01:13:58.650 --> 01:13:58.810] Let's
[01:13:58.810 --> 01:13:58.990] call
[01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.110] it
[01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.530] inducing
[01:13:59.530 --> 01:13:59.890] inputs,
[01:13:59.970 --> 01:14:00.170] because
[01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:00.350] it's
[01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.610] induced
[01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:00.810] from
[01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:00.910] the
[01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:01.090] training
[01:14:01.090 --> 01:14:01.350] data.
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:03.100] That
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:03.200] kind
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:03.300] of
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:03.920] summarizes
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.140] the
[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:04.360] training
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:04.580] data
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:04.960] in
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.040] a
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:05.420] way,
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:05.820] right?
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:06.600] So
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.520] if
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:07.600] I
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:07.720] have
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:07.820] a
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.040] million
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:08.620] data
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:08.960] points,
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:09.500] what
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:09.600] if
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:09.720] I
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:09.860] could
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:10.160] find
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:10.460] 100
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:11.640] or
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:11.860] 1
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:12.080],000
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:12.320] data
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:12.660] points
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:12.960] that
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:13.140] just
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:13.440] really
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:13.740] well
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:14.320] summarize
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:14.560] the
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:14.800] data
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.100] that
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:15.560] I
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:15.820] have
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:16.020] in
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:16.320] my
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:16.740] data
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:16.900] set?
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:18.980] So
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:19.240] the
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:19.560] idea
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:19.840] is
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.220] we
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:20.320] can
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:20.500] do
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:20.880] this
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.340] through
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:21.580] something
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:21.820] called
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.360] variational
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:22.780] approximation.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:23.180] So
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:23.300] we
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:23.880] directly
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.600] approximate
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.020] the
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:25.400] posterior
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:25.960] instead
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:26.420] of
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:27.500] using
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:27.920] numerical
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.380] algorithms
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:28.960] to
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.420] compute
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:30.420] the
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:30.900] mathematical
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:31.460] operations
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:31.960] in
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.060] the
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:32.340] posterior,
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:32.980] OK?
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:33.380] So
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:33.540] this
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:33.800] is
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:34.680] changing
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:34.960] the
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:35.340] model
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.480] for
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:37.500] your
[01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:37.800] Gaussian
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.160] process.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:38.800] So
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:38.900] you're
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.040] not
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:39.400] actually
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:39.560] doing
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:39.700] GP
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:39.980] regression
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:40.320] anymore

[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:41.560] but
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:41.720] you're
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:41.860] using
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:42.000] a

[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:44.280] close
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:44.460] as
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:44.780] possible
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.040] to
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:45.160] the

[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:45.580] process
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:45.880] posterior.
[01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.990] And
[01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.450] one
[01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:48.610] way
[01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:48.690] to

[01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:49.030] this

[01:14:49.230 --> 01:14:49.470] called
[01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:49.870] stochastic

[01:14:51.610 --> 01:14:52.050] And
[01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:52.290] what
[01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:52.410] they
[01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:52.590] do
[01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:52.890] is

[01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:55.230] a

[01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.910] process
[01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:57.830] that
[01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:58.310] depends
[01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.990] on
[01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.430] Z,
[01:14:59.670 --> 01:14:59.950] these
[01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:00.430] inducing
[01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:00.710] inputs,
[01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:00.910] the
[01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:01.250] summary
[01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.490] of
[01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:01.610] the

[01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:02.110] data.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.020] And
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:04.260] the
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:04.640] posterior
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.480] here
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:06.740] looks
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:06.980] very
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:07.320] similar
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:07.500] to
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:07.640] the
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:07.760] one
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:07.860] you
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:07.940] know
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:08.100] for
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:08.460] GPs,
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:08.720] right?
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:09.100] So
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:09.280] let's
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:09.700] ignore
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:09.980] this
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:10.340] correction
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:10.640] term
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:10.780] for
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:10.900] a
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.080] moment.
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:12.000] Then
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:12.400] this
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:12.620] part
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:12.840] here
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.160] looks
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:13.680] like
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:13.920] GP
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:14.300] regression
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:14.540] without
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:14.960] noise
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.680] on
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:15.880] these
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.200] inducing
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:16.560] inputs,
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.380] because
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:17.480] we
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:17.820] have
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560] kernel
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:19.880] function
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.240] evaluated
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:20.460] new
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:20.620] data
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:20.960] points.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:21.380] And
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:21.500] then
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:21.680] here,
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:21.940] kernel
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.300] matrix
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:22.700] evaluated
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:22.980] all
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:23.100] the
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:23.380] inducing
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:23.680] inputs
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.120] inverted
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.440] times
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.160] something.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:29.300] And
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:29.840] for
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:30.440] the
[01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:32.630] kernel,
[01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.090] we
[01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:33.390] have
[01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:34.050] prior
[01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:34.430] kernel
[01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:35.230] minus
[01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:35.850] an
[01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:36.090] update
[01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:36.570] term
[01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:37.150] that,
[01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:37.490] again,
[01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:38.370] involves
[01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:39.330] something
[01:15:39.330 --> 01:15:39.810] that
[01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:39.910] is
[01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:40.330] the
[01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:40.530] kernel
[01:15:40.530 --> 01:15:40.870] matrix
[01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:41.330] evaluated
[01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.490] at
[01:15:41.490 --> 01:15:41.590] the
[01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.850] inducing
[01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:42.130] inputs
[01:15:42.130 --> 01:15:42.510] inverted.
[01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:43.310] So
[01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.450] if
[01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:43.550] we
[01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.690] had
[01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:43.930] no
[01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:44.310] noise,
[01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:44.630] this
[01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.830] looks
[01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:45.270] almost
[01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.570] like
[01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:45.930] standard
[01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:46.130] GP
[01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.530] regression
[01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:47.230] just
[01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:47.370] on
[01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:47.470] the
[01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.710] inducing
[01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:47.970] inputs.
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:49.960] Now,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:50.080] it
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:50.200] turns
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:50.360] out
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:50.620] that
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:51.540] for
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:51.680] this
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:51.780] to
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.440] be
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:52.820] kind
[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:53.020] of
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.380] smart,
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:54.980] you
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:55.160] actually
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:55.300] have
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:55.400] a
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:55.700] correction
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:56.080] term.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:56.260] And
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:56.340] you
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:56.440] can
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:56.620] already
[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:56.880] think
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:57.100] about
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:57.400] that.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:57.920] Actually,
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.040] the
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:58.400] observation
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:58.660] noise
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.260] pops
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:15:59.440] up
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:15:59.760] nowhere
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:00.220] here,
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:01.080] right?
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:01.440] So
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:01.760] how
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:01.880] does
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.000] that
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:02.360] enter?
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:02.820] Turns
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:02.920] out
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:03.020] it
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:03.260] enters
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:03.600] here.
[01:16:04.410 --> 01:16:04.570] So
[01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:04.690] there
[01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:04.790] are
[01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.970] two
[01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:05.230] more
[01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:05.690] parameters
[01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:06.190] of
[01:16:06.190 --> 01:16:06.550] this
[01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:07.130] term.
[01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:07.850] One
[01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:07.990] is
[01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.310] the
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:09.920] vector
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.160] mu
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:10.500] here.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:10.800] And
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:10.960] then
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:11.240] this
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:11.720] correction
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:12.220] term,
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.120] it
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:13.220] kind
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:13.600] of
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.400] dampens
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:14.620] the
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:14.800] or
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.140] adds
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:15.340] more
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:15.720] uncertainty.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:18.230] So
[01:16:18.230 --> 01:16:18.350] I
[01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.490] have
[01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:18.750] three
[01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:19.150] things
[01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:19.630] that
[01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:19.870] I
[01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:20.110] can
[01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.590] modify
[01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:21.090] to
[01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:21.250] get
[01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:21.350] a
[01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.490] good
[01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:21.930] approximation
[01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:22.230] to
[01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:22.410] my
[01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:22.630] Gaussian
[01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.850] process
[01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:23.250] posterior.
[01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.650] That
[01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:23.810] is
[01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:24.190] the

[01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.230] of

[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:19.340] Sorry,

[01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:24.770] And
[01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:25.330] let's
[01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:25.650] take
[01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:25.750] a

[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.300] So
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:38.860] in

[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:39.880] you

[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:40.160] see
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:40.280] that
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:40.400] we

[01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:45.790] We

[01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:49.210] instead

[01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.210] So
[01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:52.410] this
[01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:52.630] inverse
[01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.810] is

[01:17:53.010 --> 01:17:53.370] cheap
[01:17:53.370 --> 01:17:53.930] because
[01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:54.110] it's

[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:00.400] there
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.200] are

[01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.790] points,
[01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:08.410] and

[01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.890] OK,
[01:18:11.890 --> 01:18:12.030] so
[01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:12.210] all
[01:18:12.210 --> 01:18:12.290] the

[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:52.400] posterior,
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:53.200] and
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:53.380] that
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:53.700] direct
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:54.260] approximation
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.400] only
[01:18:55.690 --> 01:18:56.990] takes
[01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.590] O
[01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.670] of
[01:18:57.670 --> 01:18:57.830] i
[01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:58.050] squared
[01:18:58.050 --> 01:18:58.270] n.
[01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.290] Great,
[01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.490] right?
[01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:01.950] Should
[01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:02.050] we
[01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:02.250] forget
[01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:02.450] about
[01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.710] iterative
[01:19:02.710 --> 01:19:02.990] methods
[01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.170] now?
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:10.780] So
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:11.240] there's
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:11.780] different
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:11.980] ways
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:12.080] you
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:12.160] can
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:12.280] do
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:12.500] this.
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:13.040] The
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.020] reason
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:14.160] for
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:14.280] the
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:14.460] naming
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:14.960] stochastic
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.160] here
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:15.260] is
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:15.480] typically
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:15.680] you
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:15.900] do
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:16.200] something
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:16.360] like
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:16.680] batched
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:17.080] optimization,
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:17.660] or
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:18.020] SGD.
[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:18.380] So
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:18.480] you
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:18.620] can
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:18.860] really
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:19.260] quickly
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:20.120] optimize
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:20.480] this
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:21.160] with
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:21.300] your
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:21.600] favorite
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.120] optimizer,
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:22.680] typically.
[01:19:28.690 --> 01:19:28.930] So
[01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:29.130] the
[01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:29.350] most
[01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.750] expensive
[01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:30.250] operation
[01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:30.710] is
[01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:31.350] asymptotically
[01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.550] in
[01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.750] this,
[01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:32.110] but
[01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.490] there's
[01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:33.290] a
[01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:33.470] number
[01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.670] of
[01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:34.030] optimization
[01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:34.530] steps
[01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:35.330] that
[01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:35.470] you
[01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:35.690] do.
[01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.230] But
[01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:36.330] the
[01:19:36.330 --> 01:19:36.470] most
[01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.750] expensive
[01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:37.250] operation
[01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.890] in
[01:19:37.890 --> 01:19:38.410] the
[01:19:38.410 --> 01:19:38.590] training
[01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:38.770] data
[01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:38.950] set
[01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:39.190] size
[01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:39.310] is
[01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.470] n.
[01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:42.390] Remember,
[01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:42.790] for
[01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:43.470] iterative
[01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:43.730] methods,
[01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:43.890] we
[01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:44.070] also
[01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.210] have
[01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:44.270] to
[01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.370] do
[01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:44.810] hyperparameter
[01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:45.290] optimization.
[01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.650] So
[01:19:45.650 --> 01:19:45.770] we
[01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.930] also
[01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:46.130] have
[01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.270] to
[01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.450] solve
[01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:46.850] multiple
[01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:47.390] problems
[01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:48.210] at
[01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:48.410] quadratic
[01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:48.870] complexity,
[01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:49.550] one
[01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.750] for
[01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.970] each
[01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:50.390] hyperparameter
[01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.790] optimization
[01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:51.070] step.
[01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:52.410] But
[01:19:52.410 --> 01:19:52.530] the
[01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:52.730] number
[01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:52.930] of
[01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:53.370] hyperparameter
[01:19:53.370 --> 01:19:53.750] optimization
[01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:54.090] steps
[01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:54.210] is
[01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:54.550] typically
[01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:55.490] way,
[01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.670] way,
[01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:55.770] way
[01:19:55.770 --> 01:19:56.070] smaller
[01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.250] than
[01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:56.370] the
[01:19:56.370 --> 01:19:56.550] problem
[01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.870] size.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:03.340] OK,
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.280] so
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.460] great,
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:05.660] right?
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:06.720] Now
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:06.840] I've
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.160] spent
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:07.600] maybe
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:07.820] an
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:08.080] hour
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:08.460] telling
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:08.580] you
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:08.760] about
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.000] iterative
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:09.300] methods,
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:09.440] and
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:09.580] now
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:09.660] I'm
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:09.880] telling
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.180] you
[01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:11.020] you
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:11.200] shouldn't
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:11.400] use
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:11.560] them.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:12.860] Well,
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:13.260] this
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:13.340] is
[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:13.480] what
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:13.940] happens,
[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:16.100] for
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:16.500] example,
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:17.140] if
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:17.260] you
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:17.580] do
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:18.040] stochastic
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:18.400] variational
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:18.620] Gaussian
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:18.960] processes.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:19.860] So
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:20.180] here
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:20.340] in
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:20.680] blue
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:21.880] is
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:22.080] the
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:22.380] exact
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:22.620] GP
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:22.960] on
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:23.260] this
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:24.140] small
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:24.340] data
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:24.620] set
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:25.560] so
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:25.840] that
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:25.940] we
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:26.120] can
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:26.460] visualize
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:26.820] it.
[01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:28.210] In
[01:20:28.210 --> 01:20:28.570] black
[01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:29.230] X's
[01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:29.410] are
[01:20:29.410 --> 01:20:29.530] the
[01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:30.030] observations,
[01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.410] so
[01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.590] these
[01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.830] are
[01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:31.070] our
[01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.310] training
[01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.550] data.
[01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:35.140] In
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:35.620] light
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:35.880] blue
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:36.100] is
[01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:36.220] the
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:36.560] uncertainty
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:36.740] of
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:36.860] the
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:37.080] exact
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:37.360] GP.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:39.580] And
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:39.740] in
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:40.280] gray
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.120] lines
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:41.360] here
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:41.600] are
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:41.720] the
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.020] inducing
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:42.260] inputs.
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:42.540] So
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.900] this
[01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.110] is
[01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.230] where
[01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:44.370] we
[01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:44.890] initialize
[01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:45.110] our

[01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:45.690] of
[01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:45.790] the

[01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.150] data
[01:20:46.150 --> 01:20:46.350] set.
[01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:46.690] Here's
[01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:47.610] a
[01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:47.850] summary
[01:20:47.850 --> 01:20:47.990] data
[01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.310] point
[01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.550] here,
[01:20:48.650 --> 01:20:48.830] here,
[01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:49.090] here,
[01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:49.430] here,
[01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.690] here,
[01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:49.850] and
[01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:50.030] here,
[01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.130] and
[01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:50.230] here.
[01:20:51.230 --> 01:20:51.810] And
[01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:51.950] now
[01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:52.310] during
[01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.770] optimization,
[01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:54.130] I
[01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:54.350] said
[01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.490] we
[01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:54.970] optimized

[01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.490] the
[01:20:59.490 --> 01:20:59.870] inducing
[01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:00.210] inputs.
[01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.390] And
[01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.470] you
[01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.570] can
[01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:00.770] see
[01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:01.070] here,

[01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.630] here
[01:21:04.630 --> 01:21:04.730] is
[01:21:04.730 --> 01:21:04.850] where
[01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:04.990] I
[01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:05.390] start.
[01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:06.190] These
[01:21:06.190 --> 01:21:06.510] inducing
[01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:06.970] inputs
[01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:07.970] find
[01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:08.090] a
[01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:08.490] location
[01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:08.730] that
[01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:09.250] summarizes
[01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:09.410] the

[01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:09.730] set
[01:21:09.730 --> 01:21:09.950] well.
[01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:13.730] But
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:14.840] there's
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.000] one
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:15.280] issue.
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:16.320] If
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:16.400] you
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:16.560] look
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:16.700] at
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:17.760] the

[01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:23.990] inputs,
[01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:25.270] it's
[01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.590] very,
[01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:25.870] very
[01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:26.210] different
[01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:27.170] from

[01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:30.070] process.
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:31.340] And
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:31.700] even
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:32.420] where
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:32.580] I
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:32.800] have
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.160] inducing
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:33.580] inputs,
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:34.460] my

[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:35.040] mean
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:35.340] doesn't
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:35.960] necessarily
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:37.600] approximate
[01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.120] the

[01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.210] mean
[01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:40.410] well.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:41.660] Now,
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:41.780] for
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:42.040] iterative
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:42.400] methods,
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:42.540] I
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:42.660] have
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:44.280] shown
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:44.420] you
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:44.540] such
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:44.840] plots,
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:44.980] but
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:45.060] I
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:45.560] haven't
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:45.800] also
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:46.320] quantified
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:46.520] how
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:46.900] close
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:47.020] it
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:47.240] is
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:47.640] to
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:47.800] the

[01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.450] So
[01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:49.530] the
[01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:49.750] question
[01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:50.050] is,
[01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:51.590] is
[01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.770] this
[01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:51.930] a
[01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:52.270] problem
[01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:52.550] for
[01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.730] these
[01:21:52.730 --> 01:21:52.890] linear
[01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:53.110] time
[01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.450] methods?
[01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.830] And
[01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.950] how
[01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:54.130] much
[01:21:54.130 --> 01:21:54.230] of
[01:21:54.230 --> 01:21:54.330] a
[01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:54.550] problem
[01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.750] is
[01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:54.870] it
[01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:55.230] for
[01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:55.810] iterative
[01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:56.090] methods?
[01:21:56.490 --> 01:21:56.810] The
[01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:56.990] one
[01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.170] thing
[01:21:57.170 --> 01:21:57.270] we
[01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.370] have
[01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:57.590] going
[01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.810] for
[01:21:57.810 --> 01:21:57.950] us
[01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:58.090] with
[01:21:58.090 --> 01:21:58.370] iterative
[01:21:58.370 --> 01:21:58.650] methods
[01:21:58.650 --> 01:21:58.930] is
[01:21:58.930 --> 01:21:59.610] we
[01:21:59.610 --> 01:21:59.770] can
[01:21:59.770 --> 01:22:00.450] online
[01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:05.130] control
[01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:05.410] the

[01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:06.050] of
[01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.150] our
[01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:06.550] approximation.
[01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:07.330] We
[01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:07.430] can
[01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.610] just
[01:22:07.610 --> 01:22:08.230] keep
[01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:08.490] running
[01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:08.650] the
[01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:08.870] method
[01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:09.090] until
[01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:09.230] we
[01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:09.350] have
[01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.490] no
[01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:09.610] more
[01:22:09.610 --> 01:22:09.990] time,
[01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:10.950] and
[01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:11.210] then
[01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:12.430] stop,
[01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:13.170] and
[01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:13.810] that's
[01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:13.950] how
[01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:14.310] accurate
[01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.530] our
[01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:14.670] GP
[01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:14.990] approximation
[01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.410] is.
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:16.380] The
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:16.660] inducing
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:16.860] point
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:17.120] method,
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:17.500] typically,
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:18.300] you
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:18.460] have
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:18.760] to
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:19.480] set
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:19.620] the
[01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:19.800] number
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:19.920] of
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.240] inducing
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:20.500] points
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:20.700] a
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.240] priori
[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:22.380] for
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:22.580] your
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:22.780] data
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:23.060] set,
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:23.880] and
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.000] then
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:24.100] you
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:24.880] optimize
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.160] them.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:25.500] Now,
[01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:25.600] you
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:25.740] can
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:25.900] run
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:26.000] the
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:26.440] optimizer
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:26.680] for
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.000] however
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:27.240] long
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:27.360] you
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:27.560] want,
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:27.740] but
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:27.840] the
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:27.980] number
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:28.100] of
[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:28.340] inducing
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:28.600] points
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:28.760] stay
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:28.880] the
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:29.060] same.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:29.840] So
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:29.920] you
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.020] have
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:30.120] to
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:30.620] control
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:31.100] the
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:32.060] fidelity
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:32.280] of
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:32.360] your
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:32.780] approximation
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:33.540] before
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:33.700] you
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:33.920] start
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.300] optimizing.
[01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.590] But
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:36.980] what
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:37.060] if
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:37.220] this
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:37.320] is
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:37.460] just
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:37.740] way
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:38.160] faster?
[01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:41.330] We
[01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:41.570] saw
[01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:41.750] that
[01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:42.150] the
[01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:42.850] theoretical
[01:22:42.850 --> 01:22:43.250] complexity
[01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:43.410] is
[01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:43.570] way
[01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:43.870] faster,
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:45.560] and
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:45.720] we
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:45.880] see
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:46.140] now
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:46.420] this
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:46.580] has
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:46.720] an
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.000] issue
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:47.220] with

[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.020] quantification.
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:49.100] So
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:49.220] the
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:49.500] question
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:49.640] that
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:49.740] I
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:49.940] leave

[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:50.600] today
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:51.760] is,
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:52.360] can
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:52.480] we
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:52.800] design
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:52.960] a

[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:54.300] where
[01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:55.030] we
[01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.190] can
[01:22:55.190 --> 01:22:55.590] trust
[01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:55.750] the

[01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.650] quantification
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:57.900] just
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:22:58.220] as
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:22:58.580] much
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.140] during
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:00.520] any

[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:00.860] of
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:00.960] the

[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:01.800] no
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.060] matter
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:02.240] how
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:02.400] much

[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:03.060] we've
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:03.260] done?
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.000] Whenever
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:04.240] we
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:04.600] stop,
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:04.820] can
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:04.940] we
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:05.360] trust
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:05.800] the
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:06.060] uncertainty?
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:06.960] Here,
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:07.320] clearly,
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:07.480] we
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:07.640] cannot
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:07.920] trust
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:08.020] the

[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:08.780] quantification
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:09.020] of
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:09.120] our
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:09.360] method.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:09.740] It's
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:09.960] way
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:10.240] far
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:10.520] away
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:10.700] from
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:10.800] the
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.000] exact

[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:11.860] assuming
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:12.040] our
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:12.240] model
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:12.380] is
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:12.700] correct.
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:19.120] All
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:19.260] right.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:19.720] With
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:20.600] that,
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:22.220] I'll
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:22.840] summarize.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:25.200] We've
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:25.360] seen
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:25.760] that,
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:26.600] clearly,

[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:30.280] There
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:30.400] are

[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:45.980] There's
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:46.140] also

[01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:04.170] And
[01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:04.330] then,
[01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.730] finally,
[01:24:05.610 --> 01:24:05.810] sparse

[01:24:05.970 --> 01:24:06.530] approximations

[01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.370] faster.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.020] There
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:11.180] might
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:11.260] be

[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:12.820] right?
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:14.800] And
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:15.320] really,
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:15.580] for
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:16.240] GPs,
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:16.640] that's
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:16.720] the

[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:17.780] why
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:17.900] we
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:18.060] use
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:18.240] Gaussian
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:18.560] processes,
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:18.980] because
[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:19.120] we
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:19.500] want
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:19.680] to

[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:21.840] how
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:22.260] much
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:22.360] we
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:22.520] should
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:22.840] trust
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:22.980] our

[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:25.140] OK.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:25.340] So
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:25.660] next
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:25.940] week,

[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:33.280] we
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:33.580] use
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:34.560] to
[01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:35.430] approximate
[01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.890] learning
[01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:36.330] algorithms,
[01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.590] like
[01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.750] the
[01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:36.930] Gaussian
[01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:37.430] process,
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.020] learning
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:39.520] algorithms
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:40.400] in
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:40.780] themselves?
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:40.940] And
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:41.040] I
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:41.180] won't
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:41.400] only
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:41.640] use
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:41.820] kind
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:41.900] of
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:42.240] language
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:42.440] that
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:42.720] alludes
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:42.880] to
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.160] that,
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:43.720] but
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:43.820] I'll
[01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:43.980] actually
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:44.240] show
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:44.420] you
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:44.920] exactly.
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:46.500] And
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:46.620] with
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:46.760] that,
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:46.940] I'll
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:47.260] close
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:47.520] today.
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:47.680] We're
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:47.860] five
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:48.020] minutes
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:48.300] early,
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:48.500] so
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:48.780] that's
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:49.040] perfect
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:49.340] for
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:49.500] you
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:49.620] to
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:49.780] now
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:50.020] fill
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:50.200] out
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:50.700] the
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:52.660] feedback
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:53.000] form.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:53.760] I
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:53.940] very
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:54.100] much
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:54.360] appreciate
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:54.700] that.
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:55.200] And
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:55.320] if
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:55.380] you
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:55.480] have
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:55.620] any
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:56.080] questions,
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:56.440] raise
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:56.540] your
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:56.700] hand.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:56.860] I'm
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:57.020] happy
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:57.160] to
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:57.400] answer
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:57.880] anything
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.760] to
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:24:58.840] the
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:24:59.000] best
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:24:59.080] of
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:24:59.200] my
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:24:59.480] ability.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:00.140] Thank
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:00.280] you.
