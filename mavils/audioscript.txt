[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.620]  Of
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.100]  course,
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.580]  because

[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.960]  you
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.480]  have
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.940]  to

[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.860]  something.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.280]  It's
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.300]  actually
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.700]  just
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.120]  very
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.460]  little

[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.840]  It's
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.960]  not
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.180]  very
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.620]  bright
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.260]  if
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.460]  you
