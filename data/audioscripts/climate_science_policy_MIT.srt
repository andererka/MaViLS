[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.340] very
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.520] little

[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.440] This
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.640] could
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.900] easily
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.240] take
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.440] more
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.580] than
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.740] a
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.120] semester,
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.760] but
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.940] we'll
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.140] do
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.260] it
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.380] in
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.500] an
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.640] hour
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.760] and
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.800] a

[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.340] So
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.900] what
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.100] I'm
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.180] going
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.320] to
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.900] mostly
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.360] do
[00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.790] is
[00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.350] do
[00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.550] what
[00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.110] economists
[00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.510] often
[00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.830] do,
[00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.070] which
[00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.250] is
[00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.410] to
[00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.570] say,
[00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.730] well,
[00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.930] let's
[00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.210] suppose
[00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.390] we
[00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.550] have
[00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.750] a
[00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.090] czar.
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.300] Let's
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.740] suppose
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.980] we
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.140] have
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.320] a
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.600] czar
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.820] who
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.400] can
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.680] set
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.240] policy.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.080] What
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.320] would
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.540] the
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.840] czar
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.100] do
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.400] about
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.880] climate?
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.860] Let's
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.180] assume
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.760] it's
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.860] a
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.280] modern
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.800] czar,
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.000] not
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.140] a
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.620] denial
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.040] czar.
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.620] I'm
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.760] going
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.860] to
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.140] argue
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.500] and
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.780] try
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.960] to
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.380] indicate
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.640] to
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.800] you
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.180] why,
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.840] even
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.080] for
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.260] a
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.500] czar,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.740] this
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.880] would
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.000] be
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.120] a
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.320] hard
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.720] problem.
[00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.050] This
[00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.230] is
[00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.390] the
[00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.610] hardest
[00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.990] public
[00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.410] policy
[00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.750] problem
[00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.010] I've
[00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.190] ever
[00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.590] come
[00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.410] near.
[00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.950] So
[00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.990] today,
[00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.210] we
[00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.370] have
[00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.510] a
[00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.870] czar.
[00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.150] Wednesday
[00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.410] and
[00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.790] Friday,
[00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.130] we
[00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.510] don't.
[00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.170] It's
[00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.370] like
[00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.530] the
[00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.730] real
[00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.030] world,
[00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.230] and
[00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.350] we
[00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.510] will
[00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.670] go
[00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.030] through
[00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.370] a
[00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.950] negotiation
[00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.030] in
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.460] which
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.860] you
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.020] will
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.240] be
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.540] on,
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.820] as
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.920] you
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.080] know,
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.300] on
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.740] teams.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.520] We'll
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.740] talk
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.860] a
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.940] little
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.080] bit
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.280] about
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.500] that
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.640] at
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.760] the
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.120] end,
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.400] because
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.540] we're
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.600] going
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.680] to
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.820] have
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.920] to
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.060] do
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.300] some
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.840] adjustments.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.780] You
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.060] all
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.260] want
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.340] to
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.480] be
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.700] rich
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.080] countries.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.320] You
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.600] can't
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.780] all
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.940] be
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.180] rich
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.580] countries.
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.440] Some
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.600] of
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.720] you
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.900] have
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.040] to
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.200] be
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.460] poor.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.540] It's
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.720] like
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.060] life.
[00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.990] All
[00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.170] right,
[00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.390] so
[00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.990] let
[00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.070] me
[00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.450] do
[00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.790] a
[00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.810] very
[00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.110] little
[00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.490] bit
[00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.030] of
[00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.370] background
[00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.970] on
[00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.130] the
[00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.470] science,
[00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.610] and
[00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.730] I
[00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.930] talk
[00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.130] about
[00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.290] why
[00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.430] it's
[00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.510] a
[00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.690] hard
[00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.130] policy
[00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.510] problem.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.980] You've
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.340] probably
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.760] seen
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.980] this
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.460] graph.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.620] This
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.820] is
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.200] from
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.140] NASA.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.100] Global
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.600] temperatures
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.860] are
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.200] rising.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.480] If
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.620] you
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.880] look
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.460] at
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.640] the
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.000] last
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.260] few
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.560] years,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.760] it
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.940] looks
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.160] like
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.320] a
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.900] slowdown.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.140] This
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.280] has
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.440] been
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.720] much
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.200] debated.
[00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.330] The
[00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.590] latest
[00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.050] evidence
[00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.630] suggests
[00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.910] this
[00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.130] is
[00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.570] because
[00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.970] of
[00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.250] La
[00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.470] Nina
[00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.070] conditions
[00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.310] in
[00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.450] the
[00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.850] Pacific,
[00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.970] which
[00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.230] tend
[00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.430] to
[00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.610] lower
[00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.850] the
[00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.310] temperature,
[00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.950] and
[00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.630] solar
[00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.110] radiation
[00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.450] is
[00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.770] at
[00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.150] a
[00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.390] minimum
[00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.650] in
[00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.870] its
[00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.230] cycle.
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.560] Those
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.860] who
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.240] follow
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.560] these
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.820] things
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.240] closely
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.860] expect,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.080] when
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.240] we
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.420] go
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.620] to
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.800] El
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.020] Nino
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.560] conditions
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.860] in
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.000] the
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.360] Pacific,
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.160] that
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.300] we
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.500] will
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.800] break
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.260] previous
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.680] records.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.800] Nine
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.940] of
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.080] the
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.280] 10
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.740] warmest
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.060] years
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.660] on
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.020] record
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.360] have
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.520] been
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.680] in
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.900] this
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.300] century.
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.960] So
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.860] if
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.040] you
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.420] smooth,
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.740] and
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.860] you
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.040] see
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.280] there's
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.420] a
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.620] lot
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.780] of
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.240] variability
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.700] year
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.820] to
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.040] year,
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.240] if
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.400] you
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.740] smooth,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.240] the
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.440] trend
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.660] is
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.040] reasonably
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.500] clear.
[00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.310] That's
[00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.690] data.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.480] This
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.700] is
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.200] inference.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.540] There's
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.900] strong
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.460] evidence,
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.020] backed
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.280] by
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.680] theory,
[00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.340] that
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.640] human
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.080] activity
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.400] has
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.540] a
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.720] lot
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.880] to
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.040] do
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.240] with
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.540] this.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.380] This
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.660] is
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.680] global
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.020] greenhouse
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.580] emissions
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.900] by
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.520] gas
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.720] in
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.540] 2004.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.160] You'll
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.460] see
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.860] on
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.080] the
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.480] right,
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.680] CO2
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.020] from
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.480] fossil
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.900] fuel
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.360] use
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.440] is
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.040] a
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.460] big
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.000] contributor,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.320] not
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.560] the
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.940] only
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.560] contributor.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.200] I
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.600] think
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.240] CO2
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.560] other
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.860] is
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.380] probably
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.100] cement
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.660] manufacture.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.920] This
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.300] is
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.800] land
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.180] use,
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.360] deforestation,
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.080] biomass,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.060] agriculture,
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.280] and
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.500] so
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.840] forth.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.600] Methane,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.200] nitrous
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.720] oxide,
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.980] which
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.160] is
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.620] a
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.120] nasty
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.480] long
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.760] live
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.180] gas,
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.080] largely
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.460] comes
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.660] from
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.300] agriculture.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.880] Methane
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.180] comes,
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.380] of
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.600] course,
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.760] from
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.920] a
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.220] variety
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.440] of
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.780] sources.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.480] And
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.660] then
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.820] there
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.900] are
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.020] a
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.180] bunch
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.340] of
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.700] long
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.100] live,
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.500] very
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.960] potent,
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.260] but
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.620] very
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.180] small,
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.760] very

[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.580] concentration
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.100] gases.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.200] This
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.400] is
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.760] by
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.640] sector.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.260] And
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.620] again,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.880] you
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.060] can
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.500] see
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.600] an
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.860] awful
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:52.220] lot
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.380] of
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.340] this
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.540] is
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.840] human
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.320] activity,
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.780] obviously,
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.080] but
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.900] generating
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.600] electricity,
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.640] manufacturing,
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.720] transportation.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.820] And
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.020] again,
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.180] you
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.360] get
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.680] land
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.940] use
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.120] and
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.680] forestry.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.920] So
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.600] it's
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.740] a
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.180] rain.
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.400] This
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.580] is
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.020] later
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.400] data,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.600] but
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.740] it
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.020] doesn't
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.240] show
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.380] it
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.540] by
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.980] gas.
[00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.930] There
[00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.030] are
[00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.150] a
[00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.330] wide
[00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.730] variety
[00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.910] of
[00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.410] activities
[00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.990] involved
[00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.910] that
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.880] emit
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.320] heat
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.720] trapping
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.220] gases.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.040] And
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.680] again,
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.060] there's
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.340] evidence.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.060] There's
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.460] theory
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.720] that
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.200] suggests
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.460] that
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.680] this
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.880] is
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.200] really
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.520] a
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.960] driver,
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.560] the
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.880] changes
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.160] in
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.420] solar
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.020] radiation.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.760] The
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.000] El
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.380] Niño,
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.740] La
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.080] Niña
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.500] is
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.820] not
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.980] big
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.240] enough.
[00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.510] Largely,
[00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.710] you
[00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.010] also
[00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.390] lose
[00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.730] soil
[00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.130] carbon.
[00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.770] If
[00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.450] you
[00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.010] cultivate
[00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.470] and
[00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.610] till
[00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.850] the
[00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.190] soil,
[00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.110] you'll
[00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.370] have
[00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.490] an
[00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.710] effect.
[00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.950] You'll
[00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.230] reduce
[00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.570] what's
[00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.770] stored
[00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.950] in
[00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.110] the
[00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.370] soil.
[00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.850] So
[00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.570] it's
[00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.010] mostly
[00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.990] deforestation,
[00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.330] but
[00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.490] it
[00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.670] can
[00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.070] also
[00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.550] be
[00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.270] just
[00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.870] agricultural
[00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.510] practices.
[00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.470] But
[00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.150] deforestation
[00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.550] is
[00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.970] crucial.
[00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.690] We're
[00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.870] going
[00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.690] to
[00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.930] talk
[00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.530] mostly
[00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.930] about
[00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.450] CO2
[00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.710] from
[00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.050] fossil
[00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.450] fuels,
[00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.750] because
[00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.050] that's
[00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.150] where
[00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.330] the
[00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.750] policy
[00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.150] action
[00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.490] is,
[00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.090] and
[00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.410] also
[00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.370] deforestation,
[00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.990] mostly
[00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.530] because
[00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.870] you
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.380] can
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.900] measure
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.520] fossil
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.900] fuel
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.240] use
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.800] relatively
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.360] easily.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.680] Figuring
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.940] out
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.120] how
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.740] agriculture
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.380] generates
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.820] nitrous
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.160] oxide
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.460] is
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.000] harder,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.940] much
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.240] harder
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.460] to
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.880] measure.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.720] But
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.180] fuel
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.640] use
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.840] is
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.000] relatively
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.720] easy.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.660] Deforestation
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.980] is
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.720] relatively
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.220] easy
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.500] to
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.840] measure.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.380] So
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.580] you
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.760] can
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.040] actually
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.460] imagine
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.180] agreements
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.040] that
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.260] might
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.460] be
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.120] enforceable.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.580] So
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.800] that's
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.900] where
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.060] the
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.480] policy
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.860] action
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.100] is.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.860] We
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.200] also
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.580] know
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.360] that
[00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.010] there
[00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.270] have
[00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.430] been
[00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.670] some
[00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.930] clear
[00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.390] impacts
[00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.690] of
[00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.010] climate
[00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.370] change.
[00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.470] Everybody's
[00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.690] seen
[00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.910] this.
[00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:47.150] This
[00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.390] is
[00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.390] the
[00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.870] change
[00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.110] in
[00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.750] sea
[00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.090] ice
[00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.330] in
[00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.730] September
[00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.970] of
[00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.390] 79
[00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.710] to
[00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.150] September
[00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.390] of
[00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.090] 2007.
[00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.070] And
[00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.470] obviously,
[00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.850] that
[00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.390] continues.
[00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.530] This
[00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.750] is
[00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.950] a
[00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.530] projection,
[00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.870] and
[00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.990] it
[00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.110] can
[00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.350] only
[00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.570] be
[00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.730] a
[00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.130] projection
[00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.450] for
[00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.770] reasons
[00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.950] I
[00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:00.110] want
[00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.230] to
[00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.470] talk
[00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.770] about,
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.740] of
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.140] days
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.480] over
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.820] 100
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.520] degrees.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.820] And
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.060] you
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.600] see,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.060] gee,
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.400] there,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.660] it
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.880] gets
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.140] hot
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.280] in
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.400] the
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.720] desert.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.300] But
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.300] if,
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.500] in
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.680] fact,
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.460] and
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.640] the
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.900] problem
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.100] with
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.420] this
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.220] is
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.660] mainly
[00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.010] human
[00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.370] health.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.100] People
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.540] who
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.400] are
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.080] fragile
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.300] in
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.420] a
[00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.700] variety
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.920] of
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.220] ways
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.380] or
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.520] who
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.740] aren't
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.940] air
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.380] conditioned
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.620] don't
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.960] deal
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.240] well
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.580] with
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.240] large
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.520] numbers
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.740] of
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.980] days
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:26.280] over
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.560] 100
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.920] degrees.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.400] It
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.700] happened
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.900] in
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.120] Europe
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.360] a
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.540] couple
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.720] of
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.940] years
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:29.220] ago.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.440] There
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.620] were
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.800] a
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.060] number
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.360] of,
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.100] more
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.240] than
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.360] a
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.600] number,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.480] a
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.680] fair
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.920] number
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.120] of
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.460] deaths.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.420] So
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.580] these
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.720] are
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.080] obvious
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.500] impacts.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.660] If
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.740] it
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:37.880] gets
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.260] warmer,
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.440] you
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.600] have
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.800] more
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.020] hot
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.440] days.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.900] If
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.000] it
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.160] gets
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.500] warmer,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.740] the
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.920] sea
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.160] ice
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.460] melts.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.980] But
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.360] that's
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.620] a
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.920] small
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.260] part
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.340] of
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.500] the
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.880] story,
[00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.270] is
[00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.610] warming.
[00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.630] So
[00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.190] why
[00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.390] is
[00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.550] this
[00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.830] hard?
[00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.830] Why
[00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.970] is
[00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:51.110] this
[00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.210] a
[00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.410] hard
[00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.770] policy
[00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.070] problem?
[00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.850] Reason
[00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.410] one
[00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.170] is
[00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.350] the
[00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.570] time
[00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.970] scales.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.740] And
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.900] the
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.180] time
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.620] scales,
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.440] CO2
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.380] doesn't
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.580] come
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.700] out
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.760] of
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.880] the
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.260] atmosphere
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.500] by
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.920] simple
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.500] exponential
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.120] decay.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.720] The
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.060] process
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.360] is
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.820] complicated.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.260] But
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.420] if
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.520] you
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.820] think
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.080] about
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.240] a
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.500] half
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.780]-life,
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.440] you
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.640] want
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.760] to
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.940] think
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.200] about
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.500] around
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.680] a
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.100] century,
[00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.810] if
[00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.910] you
[00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.030] can
[00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.230] think
[00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.350] of
[00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.430] it
[00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.550] in
[00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.750] half
[00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:13.930]-life
[00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.310] terms.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.120] Not
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.380] only
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.800] does
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.980] this
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.220] stuff
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.520] stay
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.720] up
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:17.900] there
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.040] a
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.240] long
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.520] time,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.700] but
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.860] it
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.080] takes
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.240] a
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.420] long
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.660] time
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:19.860] for
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.020] its
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.500] effects.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.520] For
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.740] the
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.920] Earth
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.120] to
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.300] be
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:22.420] in
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.980] equilibrium,
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.560] depending
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:24.880] on
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.260] how
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.460] much
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.720] heat's
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.020] coming
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.320] in
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.700] and
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.980] being
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.380] trapped,
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.200] you've
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.300] got
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.420] to
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.640] warm
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.800] the
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.020] deep
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.320] ocean.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.680] The
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:30.900] deep
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.180] ocean
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.500] is
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.000] deep.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.480] Heat
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.980] diffuses
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.640] slowly.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.720] So
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.560] it
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.840] takes
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:35.980] a
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.280] while
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.460] to
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:36.740] warm.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.040] So
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.340] we're
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.520] not
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.640] in
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.000] equilibrium
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.860] now.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.340] And
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.500] the
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:39.800] question
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:39.980] of
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.200] how
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.460] far
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:40.720] out
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:40.840] of
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.220] equilibrium
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:41.640] we
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:41.840] are
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:41.980] is
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.180] kind
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.280] of
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:42.420] a
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.720] serious
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.040] one.
[00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:45.270] So
[00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.630] even
[00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:45.810] if
[00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:45.950] you
[00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.390] cut
[00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.190] emissions
[00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:47.670] sharply
[00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.130] now,
[00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.530] warming
[00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:48.790] would
[00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:49.270] continue
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.040] for
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.580] decades.
[00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.450] Given
[00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.630] that
[00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:53.750] we're
[00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.010] not
[00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:54.170] going
[00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.290] to
[00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.510] cut
[00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.930] emissions
[00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.330] sharply,
[00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.790] we're
[00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:57.150] dealing
[00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.210] with
[00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.110] centuries.
[00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:00.110] And
[00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.250] in
[00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.470] this
[00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:00.770] literature,
[00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.270] people
[00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.650] run
[00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:01.830] out
[00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:02.010] to
[00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:02.730] 2100
[00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:03.090] and
[00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:03.650] typically
[00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.970] out
[00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:04.330] beyond
[00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:04.990] 2100
[00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.230] in
[00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.470] thinking
[00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:05.810] about
[00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:05.970] a
[00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:06.250] variety
[00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:06.470] of
[00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:06.870] things.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.140] Most
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.600] human
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.120] problems
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:10.440] don't
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.680] have
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.220] timescales
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.500] like
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:11.740] that.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.200] It
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.680] means
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.280] that
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:14.660] actions
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.020] taken
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.600] today
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.500] will
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.020] affect
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.600] your
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.120] grandchildren.
[00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.610] That's
[00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:19.770] not
[00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.090] true
[00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.290] in
[00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:20.530] most
[00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.050] areas
[00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.370] of
[00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:21.810] policy.
[00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:22.030] You
[00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:22.170] can
[00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:22.370] do
[00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:22.690] tax
[00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.210] policy
[00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.070] lots
[00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.430] between
[00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.790] now
[00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.910] and
[00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:25.050] the
[00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:25.270] time
[00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.470] your
[00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:25.890] grandchildren
[00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:26.350] vote.
[00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.590] But
[00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.230] CO2,
[00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.810] it's
[00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:29.030] still
[00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:29.210] going
[00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.270] to
[00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.410] be
[00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:29.670] there.
[00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:30.850] CO2
[00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:31.110] emitted
[00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.450] today
[00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:31.630] will
[00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:31.810] still
[00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:31.970] be
[00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:32.150] there
[00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.290] in
[00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:32.690] large
[00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.150] quantity
[00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:33.410] when
[00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:33.590] your
[00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.030] grandchildren
[00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.290] are
[00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:34.550] walking
[00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.990] around
[00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.910] blaming
[00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:36.110] you
[00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.330] for
[00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:36.490] it.
[00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.670] So
[00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:38.410] if
[00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.230] the
[00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.530] czar
[00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:39.870] has
[00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:40.050] to,
[00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.250] if
[00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.390] we
[00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:40.550] have
[00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.670] a
[00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.030] climate
[00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:41.590] czar,
[00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.230] he
[00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.490] has
[00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:42.650] to
[00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:42.890] think
[00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:43.190] about
[00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.430] how
[00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.630] to
[00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.010] treat
[00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:44.790] people
[00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.210] not
[00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:45.490] yet
[00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:45.870] born.
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.180] Because
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.640] actions
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.000] today
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.280] will
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.680] affect
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.180] people
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:49.460] not
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:49.700] yet
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.000] born.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:51.520] I
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:51.680] mean,
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:51.940] this
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.060] is
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:52.120] a
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.440] typical
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:52.900] example.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:53.180] This
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:53.340] is
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.740] somebody's
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.100] story
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:55.400] of
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:55.600] what
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:55.860] gets
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.200] flooded
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.480] in
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:56.800] Florida
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.080] if
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.200] you
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.360] get
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.560] about
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:57.740] a
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:57.920] meter
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.240] sea
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.500] level
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:58.920] rise.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.120] A
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.280] meter
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:08:59.580] sea
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:08:59.840] level
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.360] rise
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:00.600] is
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:00.860] sort
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.040] of
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.380] order
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:01.560] of
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:01.960] magnitude
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.200] what
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.400] might
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.660] happen
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:02.800] in
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:02.920] a
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.300] century.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:05.600] What's
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:05.720] it
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.060] worth
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.940] today
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.780] to
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.220] prevent
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.260] that
[00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.310] in
[00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.350] 2112?
[00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.010] For
[00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.470] reference,
[00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.290] my
[00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.550] mother
[00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.870] lives
[00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:16.350] there,
[00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.990] more
[00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.090] or
[00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.330] less.
[00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:17.590] So
[00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.010] she's
[00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:18.290] OK.
[00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.030] On
[00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.150] the
[00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.310] other
[00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.490] hand,
[00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:19.710] she's
[00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.950] 90
[00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:20.170] years
[00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:20.450] old.
[00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:20.630] This
[00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.890] doesn't
[00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.150] apply
[00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.310] to
[00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.530] her.
[00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.310] But
[00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:23.550] it
[00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.970] will
[00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.570] apply
[00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.210] potentially
[00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:25.730] to
[00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.850] great
[00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.070]-great
[00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:27.630]-grandchildren.
[00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.150] So
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.480] timescales
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:30.680] of
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:30.860] a
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.240] century
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:31.720] or
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.040] more
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.240] are
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:32.880] hard
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.980] because
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.260] you
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:34.460] know
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.160] you
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:35.480] want
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:35.640] a
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.140] discount.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:38.540] But
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:38.820] how
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:38.960] do
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.100] you
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:39.280] do
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:39.640] that?
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.300] This
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:40.440] is
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:40.600] a
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:40.840] live
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.460] controversy.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.020] I'm
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.180] not
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.320] going
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:42.420] to
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:42.580] give
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:42.700] you
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:42.820] an
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.020] answer.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:43.740] Economists
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.520] have
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:44.860] nasty
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.300] arguments
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.640] about
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:45.880] this.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.020] There
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.160] are
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.440] three
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:46.780] ways
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:46.940] you
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.100] might
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:47.260] want
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:47.360] to
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.520] think
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:47.740] about
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:47.880] it.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.120] The
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.460] obvious
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:50.700] way
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:50.840] to
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.040] think
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.280] about
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:51.440] what
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:51.540] am
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:51.640] I
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:51.760] going
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:51.860] to
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.000] do
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.240] about
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:52.400] a
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:52.680] century
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:52.960] from
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.200] now
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:53.420] is
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:53.600] to
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:53.880] just
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.140] think
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.540] about
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.120] private
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:55.500] sector.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:56.720] Well,
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:56.880] I
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.000] could
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.640] put
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:57.720] it
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:57.820] in
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:57.980] a
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:58.340] bank,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:58.620] or
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:58.720] I
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:58.840] could
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.160] invest
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.280] it
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:09:59.380] in
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:09:59.520] a
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:09:59.800] business,
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.100] or
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.260] I
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.400] could
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.760] invest
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:00.900] it
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.000] in
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.220] dealing
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:01.400] with
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:01.640] climate
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.080] change.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:02.820] I
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.040] make
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.280] that
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:03.680] choice.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:04.600] So
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.040] I
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.440] ought
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:05.500] to
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:05.660] be
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:05.900] using
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:06.180] the
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.580] same
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.140] kind
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.360] of
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.020] discounting
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:08.160] in
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.380] both
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:08.940] decisions,
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:09.280] right?
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.460] Because
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:09.580] I
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:09.720] don't
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:09.860] want
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.060] to
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.040] have
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.180] an
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.560] imbalance.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:12.720] You
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.080] missed
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.300] the
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:13.820] science.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.360] You
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:14.540] could
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:14.660] have
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:14.900] fixed
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.100] it.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.560] This
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:18.780] is
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.280] Professor
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.720] Solomon,
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.060] who
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:20.400] has
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:20.700] forgotten
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:20.960] more
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.240] about
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:21.520] climate
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.020] science
[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.700] than
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:22.860] I
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.020] could
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.260] ever
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:23.820] aspire
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.120] to
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.380] learn.
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:25.060] At
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.280] any
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:25.500] rate,
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:25.780] we're
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.060] talking
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:26.300] about
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.720] policy,
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:26.880] and
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.020] we're
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:27.240] talking
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.540] about
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.560] discounting
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.460] and
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:29.720] why
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.400] this
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:30.540] is
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:30.840] hard.
[00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:31.870] So
[00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:32.690] one
[00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.550] school
[00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.770] of
[00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:34.090] thought
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.040] says
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.260] you've
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:36.380] got
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:36.500] to
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.840] use
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.260] a
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:38.940] private
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.220] sector
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:39.580] discount
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:39.880] rate.
[00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.870] And
[00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.270] one
[00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:42.730] reason
[00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:42.990] this
[00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.270] school
[00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:43.450] of
[00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:43.910] thought
[00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.350] achieved
[00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.030] prominence
[00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.410] was
[00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:45.610] the
[00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:45.850] Army
[00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.190] Corps
[00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.350] of
[00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.910] Engineers,
[00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:48.130] when
[00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:48.690] deciding
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.860] whether
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.020] or
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:50.160] not
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.320] to
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:50.540] build
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.060] dams,
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.320] always
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:51.560] used
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:51.680] a
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:51.880] very
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.100] low
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.380] discount
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:52.720] rate.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:54.540] Dams
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:54.860] last
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.000] a
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.180] long
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:55.520] time.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:56.300] So
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.440] if
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:56.540] you
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:56.760] use
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:56.880] a
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.100] very
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:57.340] low
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:57.720] discount
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.060] rate,
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.260] dams
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:10:59.460] look
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.760] pretty
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.180] promising
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:00.840] economically.
[00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.130] And
[00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.290] it
[00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:02.490] was
[00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:02.690] a
[00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:03.350] huge

[00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:04.810] in
[00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:04.970] the

[00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.170] to

[00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.430] a

[00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.350] rate,
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:09.500] to
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:09.680] say
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:09.800] you
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:09.960] can
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.180] build

[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.200] or
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.340] you
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:11.460] can
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:11.640] build
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:11.780] a

[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:12.760] You
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:12.940] ought

[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:14.940] both
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.380] cases.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:15.580] You
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:15.720] ought

[00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.010] There's
[00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:21.130] a

[00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:22.030] thought
[00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.230] that
[00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.430] says,
[00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:22.650] wait
[00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:22.770] a
[00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:22.870] minute,
[00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.130] this
[00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:23.530] isn't
[00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.290] really

[00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:25.970] sector
[00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.030] decision.
[00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.290] If
[00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.390] you
[00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:27.610] think
[00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:27.850] about
[00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:28.230] optimal

[00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:30.510] usually
[00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.050] says,
[00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:32.550] let
[00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.650] me
[00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:32.910] not
[00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.710] do
[00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.890] more

[00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:36.350] usually
[00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.750] says
[00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:36.970] there
[00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.250] are

[00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.570] the

[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:42.960] If
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.080] you're
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.260] doing
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:43.660] everything
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.200] optimally
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.360] in
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:44.500] the

[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.060] there
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.160] are

[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:46.500] future.
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.200] One,
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:47.360] there
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:47.520] might
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:47.660] be
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:47.820] a
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.080] pure

[00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.950] whatever
[00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:52.230] that
[00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.430] might
[00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.750] mean.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:54.800] And
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.320] you
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:55.700] value
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.900] benefits
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.160] in
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.280] the

[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:57.780] less

[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.300] benefits
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.560] today
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:58.820] because
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.120] people
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.240] in
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:11:59.340] the

[00:11:59.540 --> 00:11:59.720] will
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:11:59.860] be
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.100] richer.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:01.820] And
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.340] therefore,
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.400] being
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:03.760] just
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.000] a
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.140] little
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:04.480] bit
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.540] quick
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:05.820] with
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:05.960] the
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.300] hands,
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.480] income
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:08.780] on
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:08.900] the
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.160] margin
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.320] is
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:09.480] worth
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:09.840] less.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.260] If
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:11.600] I
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:11.780] were
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:11.900] in
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.020] the
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.280] future
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.440] and
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:12.700] I
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:12.860] were
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.260] richer,
[00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.450] then
[00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:14.610] a
[00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:14.990] dollar's
[00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.110] worth
[00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.250] of
[00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:15.550] benefit
[00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:15.770] would
[00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:15.950] be
[00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:16.150] worth
[00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.390] less
[00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:16.550] to
[00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.710] me
[00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.010] then
[00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:17.190] than
[00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.310] it
[00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:17.470] is
[00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.870] now.
[00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.790] I'll
[00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.010] take
[00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:19.210] that
[00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:19.370] into
[00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.690] account.
[00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.910] I'll
[00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.250] discount
[00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:20.490] that
[00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:20.870] second
[00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.190] term
[00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.450] because
[00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:21.930] people
[00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.110] will
[00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.270] be
[00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:22.750] wealthier,
[00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:23.150] says
[00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.270] you
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:24.560] make
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:24.720] a
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.060] judgment.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:25.940] There
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.360] are
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:26.780] formulas.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:26.980] I
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.140] won't
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:27.400] trouble
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:27.640] you.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.680] There
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:28.780] are
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.200] formulas
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:29.900] that
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.220] say,
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:30.580] here's
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:30.780] how
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:30.980] you
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.280] deal
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.480] with
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:31.760] that.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.160] And
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.300] then
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.720] you
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.020] say,
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.240] well,
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.740] I
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:34.900] have
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.040] a
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.360] preference.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:35.540] We
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:35.700] all
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:35.820] have
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.160] preference
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:36.320] for
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:36.620] today
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:36.840] over
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.280] tomorrow.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.240] That's
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.360] a
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:38.520] pure

[00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.030] approach
[00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.290] that's
[00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.530] come
[00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:42.810] into
[00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:43.950] the
[00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:44.850] literature
[00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:45.450] recently
[00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:45.710] says,
[00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.990] why
[00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.130] do
[00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:46.250] you
[00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.410] have

[00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:47.710] preference?
[00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.930] What
[00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.070] does
[00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:48.330] that
[00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:48.570] mean?
[00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:49.810] That
[00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.290] discriminates
[00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:50.650] between
[00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.370] generations.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.040] A

[00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:01.310] to
[00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.590] them
[00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.870] less
[00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.010] than

[00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:02.550] to
[00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.830] me.
[00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:04.610] That
[00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.150] doesn't
[00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.450] make

[00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.350] sense.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.080] So
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.480] I'd
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:08.740] use

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.500] and
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:11.660] then
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:11.900] make
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.040] a

[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.180] I
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.500] can,
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:13.640] if
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:13.740] I
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:13.960] want

[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:15.660] they

[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:16.340] how
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:16.540] much
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:16.740] that
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:16.880] ought
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.000] to

[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.000] when
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.140] I

[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.600] Now,

[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:22.660] present

[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.260] Those

[00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.090] work
[00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:53.250] for
[00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:53.410] me
[00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:53.830] called
[00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:54.470] the
[00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.810] magic
[00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:55.070] ray
[00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:55.310] gun.
[00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.470] You
[00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.650] let
[00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:56.790] me
[00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:57.150] discount
[00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:57.670] anything
[00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.910] at
[00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.230] 7
[00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.630]%
[00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.550] in
[00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.690] the
[00:14:59.690 --> 00:14:59.970] future.
[00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:00.170] It
[00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.450] goes
[00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:00.790] away.
[00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:02.930] It's
[00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:03.070] a
[00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:03.770] disappearing
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.080] function.
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:06.260] I
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:06.400] would
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:06.660] spend
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.180] $9

[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.460] today
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:08.680] to
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:08.980] avoid
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.120] a
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.400] million
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:09.880] dollars
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.080] worth
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.220] of
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:10.620] damages
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:10.860] in
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.080] 100
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.480] years
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.040] if
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:12.200] I
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.420] use
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:12.620] that
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.040] discount
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:13.300] rate.
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.220] It
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:14.640] matters
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:14.840] a
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.220] lot.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.280] It
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:16.620] matters
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:16.820] a
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.080] lot.
[00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:18.770] And
[00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:19.030] there's
[00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.570] no
[00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.330] easy
[00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:20.810] way,
[00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.790] I
[00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:22.130] think,
[00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.330] to
[00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:22.730] decide
[00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.010] among
[00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:23.310] these
[00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.730] views.
[00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:24.910] If
[00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.070] you
[00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:25.350] scratch
[00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.690] most
[00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:26.230] economists,
[00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:26.510] they
[00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:26.770] come
[00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.070] down
[00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:27.350] here
[00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.510] at
[00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.310] 3%,
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.480] say.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:30.760] But
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:30.940] if
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:31.080] you
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.440] ask
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:31.740] them,
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.280] well,
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:32.520] wait
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:32.640] a
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:32.780] minute.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.000] Aren't
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.140] you
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:33.500] crowding
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:33.700] out
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.080] private
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.640] investments?
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:34.900] They
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.060] say,
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.360] oh,
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:35.600] well,
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:35.940] maybe,
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.260] maybe
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:36.620] not.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.040] And
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.200] if
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.340] you
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:38.580] ask
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:38.740] them,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:38.920] well,
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.180] why
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:39.320] are
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:39.460] you
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.180] discriminating
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:40.520] against
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:40.840] future
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.380] generations
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:41.660] with
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:41.860] this
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.160] pure
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.440] rate
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:42.560] of
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:42.840] time
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.260] preference?
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.400] Where
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:44.580] does
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:44.780] that
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.020] come
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.340] from?
[00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:47.850] Most
[00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:48.110] people
[00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.350] go,
[00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.650] well,
[00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:48.970] yeah,
[00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.270] that's
[00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:49.410] a
[00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:49.730] point.
[00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.230] So
[00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.710] you
[00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.890] can
[00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:52.150] make
[00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.550] arguments
[00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.790] for
[00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:53.050] all
[00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.290] three
[00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:53.430] of
[00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.670] these.
[00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.290] And
[00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.410] they
[00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.570] have
[00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:54.810] very
[00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:55.130] different
[00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:55.650] implications.
[00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.050] The
[00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:56.310] czar
[00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.490] will
[00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:56.730] have
[00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:56.910] to
[00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:57.270] choose.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:58.260] Does
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:58.540] this
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.260] see
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:15:59.440] the
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:15:59.720] issue,
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:15:59.980] I
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.240] hope?
[00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:01.590] If
[00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.750] you're
[00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:01.910] talking
[00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:02.150] about
[00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.930] 5
[00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:03.130] years,
[00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:03.370] 10
[00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:03.590] years,
[00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:03.730] it
[00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:03.970] doesn't
[00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:04.230] matter
[00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.450] that
[00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:04.730] much.
[00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.310] If
[00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:05.450] you're
[00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:05.630] talking
[00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:05.850] about
[00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:06.110] 100
[00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.410] years,
[00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:06.630] which
[00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:06.790] we
[00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:07.010] are
[00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:07.270] here,
[00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:07.790] it
[00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.190] does,
[00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.970] or
[00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:09.290] more.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:12.920] OK,
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:13.980] that's
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.340] hard.
[00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.990] And
[00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.150] it's
[00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.370] hard
[00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.530] for
[00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:16.690] the
[00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:16.990] czar.
[00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.330] It's
[00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:17.510] not
[00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:17.710] just
[00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.950] hard
[00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:18.390] politically.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:20.520] I
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:20.920] think
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:21.440] the
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:21.860] reason,
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:22.260] so
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:22.480] that's
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:22.660] one
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:22.880] reason
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.100] why
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.280] it's
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:23.580] hard.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.640] The
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.040] czar
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.420] is
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:25.680] willing
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:25.900] to
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.160] make
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:26.840] sacrifices
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.420] today
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.260] for
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:28.900] generations
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.340] not
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:29.620] yet
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.320] born
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:30.640] or
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:30.960] even
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.360] thought
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:31.640] of.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.460] Many
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:33.780] other
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.080] people
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:34.240] who
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:34.500] aren't
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:34.800] as
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.680] farsighted
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:35.840] as
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.020] the
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:36.180] czar
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:36.380] may
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:36.520] have
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:36.740] trouble
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.000] doing
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.280] that
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.320] or
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:38.620] voting
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:38.820] to
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:38.960] do
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.200] that.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:39.980] That's
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.100] a
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.820] tough
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.080] trade
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:41.260]-off,
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:41.500] right?
[00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:42.570] We
[00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:42.710] could
[00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.070] reduce
[00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:43.450] emissions
[00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:43.870] today
[00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.510] sharply,
[00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:45.650] and
[00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.770] it
[00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:45.990] wouldn't
[00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.790] make
[00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.010] much
[00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:47.330] difference
[00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:47.550] to
[00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.770] us,
[00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:48.010] might
[00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:48.170] not
[00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.370] make
[00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:48.590] much
[00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.890] difference
[00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.090] to
[00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:49.410] us,
[00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.310] might
[00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.550] make
[00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.790] some
[00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.110] difference
[00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.290] to
[00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.430] our
[00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.770] children,
[00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.530] might
[00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:52.730] make
[00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:52.870] a
[00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.030] lot
[00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.170] of
[00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:53.470] difference
[00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.670] to
[00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.870] their
[00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.230] children.
[00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.790] You
[00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.990] can't
[00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.130] even
[00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:55.430] imagine
[00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.710] having
[00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.150] grandchildren
[00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.350] at
[00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.510] this
[00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:56.730] point,
[00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:56.950] right?
[00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.070] Am
[00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:57.150] I
[00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.310] right?
[00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.470] I
[00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.730] hope.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:00.500] But
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:00.640] you
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:00.920] will.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:02.980] And
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.180] so
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:03.340] will
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:03.580] they.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.240] OK,
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:05.740] that's
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:05.900] one
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.100] reason
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:06.260] why
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:06.400] it's
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:06.600] hard,
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:06.840] because
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.040] it's
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.280] hard
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:07.440] to
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:07.700] think
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:07.880] in
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.100] terms
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:08.260] of
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:08.380] a
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:08.700] century
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:08.980] when
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.140] you're
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:09.340] making
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:09.800] decisions
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.220] today
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:10.680] or
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:10.960] more.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:13.800] A
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.040] second
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.320] reason
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:14.540] why
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:14.720] this
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:14.840] is
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.060] hard,
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.280] even
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:15.460] for
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:15.620] the
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:15.880] czar,
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:16.080] is
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:16.540] uncertainty.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:21.700] And
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.160] one
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:22.340] of
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:22.540] the
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.580] things
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:24.980] Professor
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.400] Solomon
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:25.580] and
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:25.700] I
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:25.860] have
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:26.200] learned
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:26.880] is
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.100] you
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:27.400] can't
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:27.640] say
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.100] uncertain
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.440] in
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:28.760] public
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.300] discourse,
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.280] because
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:30.740] uncertain
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:30.920] to
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.060] the
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.300] public
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:31.680] means,
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:31.940] my
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.220] God,
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.340] I
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:32.460] don't
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:32.620] have
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:32.760] a
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.020] clue.
[00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.430] What
[00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.850] uncertain
[00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.390] means
[00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.590] in
[00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.810] this
[00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:36.330] context
[00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:36.670] is
[00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.190] I
[00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.390] may
[00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.550] not
[00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:37.670] know
[00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:37.830] the
[00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:38.270] probability
[00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.830] distribution,
[00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.150] but
[00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.330] there
[00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:39.530] is
[00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:39.690] a
[00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.090] probability
[00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:40.830] distribution.
[00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.210] And
[00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:43.430] it's
[00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.790] not
[00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.190] infinitely
[00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.630] spread
[00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:45.950] out.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.220] If
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:48.340] you
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:48.620] think
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:48.880] about
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.340] elements
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:49.560] of
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.100] uncertainty,
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:51.740] what
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:51.940] will
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:52.120] the
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:52.480] atmosphere
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:52.860] look
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.080] like
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.200] in
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:53.440] 100
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:53.740] years
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:53.880] if
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:53.980] we
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.120] don't
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.280] do
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:54.580] anything?
[00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:56.450] Well,
[00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.010] that
[00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:57.390] depends
[00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.610] on
[00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.270] population.
[00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:58.950] Does
[00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:59.250] China
[00:17:59.250 --> 00:17:59.730] collapse?
[00:17:59.790 --> 00:17:59.910] Does
[00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.130] China
[00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:00.390] not
[00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.770] collapse?
[00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.950] It
[00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:01.150] depends
[00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:01.310] on
[00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.590] future
[00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.090] economic
[00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.530] growth.
[00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:03.110] It
[00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.410] depends
[00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:03.630] on
[00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.750] the
[00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.950] mix
[00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:04.090] of
[00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:04.550] activity,
[00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.790] what
[00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.090] happens
[00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.270] to
[00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.870] manufacturing
[00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:06.190] versus
[00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.710] services.
[00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.250] It
[00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.690] depends
[00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:07.930] on
[00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:08.170] new
[00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:08.770] technologies.
[00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:10.370] Somebody
[00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.730] comes
[00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.950] up
[00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:11.110] with
[00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.370] cheap
[00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:11.850] storage.
[00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:12.050] The
[00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:12.290] world
[00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:12.570] moves
[00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:12.750] to
[00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.990] solar
[00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.390] power.
[00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.610] It's
[00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.790] a
[00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:14.130] very
[00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:14.470] different
[00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.010] world
[00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:17.150] than
[00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.330] if
[00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.510] that
[00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.810] doesn't
[00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.090] happen.
[00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:18.390] Those
[00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.530] are
[00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:18.790] all
[00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:19.250] big
[00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.870] uncertainties.
[00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:20.170] So
[00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:20.370] we
[00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:20.490] don't
[00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:20.690] really
[00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:21.010] know
[00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:21.310] what
[00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.670] emissions
[00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:21.910] will
[00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:22.130] look
[00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.430] like.
[00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:25.610] There
[00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.690] are
[00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.210] uncertainties
[00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:26.470] about
[00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.630] the
[00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.890] climate
[00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:27.330] system,
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:28.940] serious

[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:33.560] mentioned,
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.020] there's
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.220] this

[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.200] There
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.400] are
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:38.800] issues

[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:42.320] Did
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:42.420] you
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:42.540] want
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:42.640] to

[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:46.500] Can
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:46.780] I
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.100] provoke
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.340] you
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:47.500] into
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:47.700] a
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:47.980] comment?
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.320] Oh,
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:56.520] I
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:56.760] just
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:56.980] want
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.440] some
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.900] illustrative
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.480] detail
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:00.860] or

[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:02.460] that
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:02.680] might
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:02.940] be
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.900] a
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.480] concern
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.240] or
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.440] that
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:05.680] might
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:05.880] be
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.800] nonlinearities
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.020] or
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:07.200] that
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:07.420] might
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:07.600] be
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:07.780] like
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.060] falling
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.280] off
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.400] the
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:08.620] table.
[00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.670] You
[00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:14.790] want
[00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:14.870] to
[00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:15.010] take
[00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:15.130] a
[00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:15.330] second?
[00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:15.510] Just
[00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.710] take
[00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.830] a
[00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:16.030] second.
[00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.990] He's
[00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:17.190] got
[00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.330] to
[00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:17.330] be
[00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:17.590] honest.
[00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.810] I
[00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.990] hate
[00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.130] to
[00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:18.670] waste
[00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:18.810] a
[00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:19.170] resource.
[00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.830] I'll
[00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.970] do
[00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:20.150] my
[00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.530] best.
[00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:22.230] This
[00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.750] issue
[00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.970] of
[00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:23.210] tipping
[00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.610] points,
[00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.770] in
[00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:24.010] my
[00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:24.210] mind,
[00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:24.370] is
[00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:24.610] actually
[00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:24.750] a
[00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.870] lot
[00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:25.130] more
[00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.630] difficult
[00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:26.190] than
[00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.370] the
[00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:26.610] issue
[00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:26.970] of
[00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:27.890] irreversibility.
[00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.670] The
[00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.410] irreversibility
[00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.010] problem
[00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:30.590] we
[00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.890] can
[00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:31.250] talk
[00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.590] about
[00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.790] a
[00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:31.930] little
[00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:32.130] bit
[00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:32.350] more
[00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.790] clearly.
[00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:35.430] For
[00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.950] example,
[00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:37.810] if
[00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:38.290] it
[00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:38.590] were
[00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.790] to
[00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:38.930] be
[00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:39.130] the
[00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:39.530] case
[00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.070] that
[00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.430] Arctic
[00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.670] sea
[00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:40.950] ice
[00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:41.210] were
[00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.670] to
[00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.150] disappear,
[00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:43.770] you
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.600] might
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.240] imagine
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.120] that
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.120] that
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:47.280] would
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:47.720] be
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.440] an
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.100] irreversible
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:49.760] process.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:49.940] But
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.020] I
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.100] think
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:50.220] we're
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:50.540] finding
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:50.840] more
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.000] and
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.320] more
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:51.960] that
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.240] it
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:52.700] actually
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.400] isn't,
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.180] even
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:54.340] though
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:54.460] we
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:54.580] had
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:54.940] very
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.240] low
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.460] Arctic
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:55.660] sea
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:55.780] ice
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:55.940] in
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.700] 2007.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.120] Because
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.320] we
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:57.500] have
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:57.720] such
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.020] cold
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:58.520] winters,
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:19:59.460] we
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:19:59.640] have
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:19:59.760] the
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.120] ability
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:00.340] to
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:00.840] reform
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.040] the
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.240] sea
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:01.420] ice
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:01.720] because
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.000] it's
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.260] thin.
[00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:03.970] Even
[00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:04.330] when
[00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:04.630] you
[00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.790] have
[00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.130] multi
[00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:05.350]-year
[00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.590] ice,
[00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:05.830] it's
[00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.050] still
[00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:06.630] relatively
[00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:07.010] thin.
[00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.190] It's
[00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.390] only
[00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.570] a
[00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:07.790] few
[00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:08.310] years
[00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.850] that
[00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:09.250] matters.
[00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.550] But
[00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:09.710] when
[00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.950] we,
[00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:10.130] for
[00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.550] example,
[00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.750] do
[00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:12.150] something
[00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:12.470] that
[00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.890] causes
[00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:13.070] a
[00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.230] big
[00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.530] dent
[00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:13.690] in
[00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:13.790] the
[00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:14.030] Greenland
[00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.310] ice
[00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.650] sheet,
[00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:15.230] now
[00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.870] that
[00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:16.630] truly
[00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.030] is
[00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:17.350] something
[00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.590] that
[00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.750] you
[00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.910] could
[00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.190] think
[00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.610] about
[00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:19.250] as
[00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.270] irreversible.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:21.760] It's
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:21.860] going
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:21.980] to
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.180] take
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:22.360] a

[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:22.880] very
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.240] long
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.620] time.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:23.840] So
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.040] on
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.440] human
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:24.760] time
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.100] scales,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.360] it's
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:25.800] essentially
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.500] irreversible
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:26.680] if
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:26.800] you
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.080] lose
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.240] a
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:27.480] big
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.000] piece
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.220] of

[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.180] ice
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:29.420] sheet.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:30.420] Is
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:30.620] there
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:30.860] a
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.160] tipping
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:31.760] point
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.340] beyond
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:32.840] which
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.300] the

[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:36.840] apart
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.160] is
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:37.460] something
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.240] that's
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:38.460] been
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.060] raised.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:39.980] Much
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:40.400] more
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:40.760] of
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:40.920] a
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.380] controversial
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:41.840] issue,
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.180] it's
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.960] conceivable.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.220] But
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:44.860] most
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.840] scientists
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.160] who
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:46.720] study
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.180] the
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:47.440] ice
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:47.740] would
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.080] argue
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.720] that
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.200] it's
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:49.400] more
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:49.760] likely
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:49.960] to
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.080] be
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.220] a
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:50.540] slow
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.060] process.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:51.520] But
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:51.880] it's
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.280] possible.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:52.620] And
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:52.820] one
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:52.920] of
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.060] the
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.340] things
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:53.680] that
[00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:54.750] could
[00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.870] be
[00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.190] a
[00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.410] tipping
[00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:57.850] point
[00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.350] for
[00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.550] the
[00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:58.810] Arctic

[00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.330] people
[00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.510] have
[00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.810] also
[00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:00.190] talked
[00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.550] about,
[00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:00.730] of
[00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:00.950] course,
[00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:01.190] is
[00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.610] methane
[00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.330] release
[00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.470] from
[00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.230] things
[00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.610] like
[00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:07.690] undersea
[00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.290] deposits
[00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:08.470] of
[00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.870] methane
[00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:09.030] that
[00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:09.130] are
[00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:09.390] actually
[00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.750] tied
[00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.030] up
[00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:10.670] in
[00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.670] formations
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.120] called
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:13.920] clathrates.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.240] And
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:14.540] also
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:14.780] in
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:15.560] permafrost,
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:15.820] which
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.020] you're
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:16.360] probably
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:16.740] more
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.140] familiar
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.500] with.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:17.880] So
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.820] there
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.100] are
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:19.660] ways
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:19.960] to
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.340] trigger
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:20.920] things
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.240] that
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:21.480] in
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:21.660] the
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:21.980] tipping
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.320] point
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:22.740] framework
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.100] usually
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.500] involve
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:23.920] ice.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:24.760] And
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.700] you
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:25.840] can
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.060] sort
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:26.160] of
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.320] see
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:26.520] why
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:26.680] that
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:26.820] would
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:27.000] be.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.240] It's
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.400] either
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:27.720] ice
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:27.920] or
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.120] it's
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:28.420] not.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:28.960] There
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.140] is
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.600] no
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.340] slow
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.020] transition
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:32.600] from
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.460] one
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:33.700] to
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.260] another.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:34.560] It's
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:34.680] a
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:34.800] real
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.220] change
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:35.380] of
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:35.760] state.
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:36.600] So
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:36.960] that's
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.260] some
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:37.600] ideas.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:37.780] RICHARD
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:37.780] SCHMALENSEE.
[00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.870] So
[00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.490] that's
[00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.850] hard.
[00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:44.170] The
[00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:44.390] czar
[00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.670] has
[00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:44.830] to
[00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:45.150] think
[00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:45.450] about
[00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:45.890] those
[00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:46.630] possibilities,
[00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.390] which
[00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.590] we
[00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.930] know
[00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:49.350] something,
[00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:50.110] but
[00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.390] we
[00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.590] don't
[00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.850] know.
[00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:51.210] We
[00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:51.450] can't
[00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:51.650] tell
[00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:51.850] when
[00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:51.990] that
[00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.190] might
[00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.470] occur,
[00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:52.690] if
[00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:53.290] those
[00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:53.510] things
[00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.710] might
[00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.010] occur.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.440] Even
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:58.800] climate
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.480] models,
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:00.920] complex

[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.000] models
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.180] of

[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.100] system,
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:03.680] and
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:03.820] there
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.000] are
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.160] a
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:04.360] number
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:04.640] of
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:04.920] them,
[00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:06.150] disagree
[00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:06.550] on
[00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:06.730] what
[00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.190] happens
[00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.990] regionally.
[00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:09.790] Will
[00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:09.950] it
[00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:10.150] be
[00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:10.530] wetter
[00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:10.730] or
[00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:11.170] drier?
[00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:12.620] Well,
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:12.940] that
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.300] matters
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:13.500] a
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:13.920] lot.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:15.260] It
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:15.620] matters
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:15.840] a
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.120] lot
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.400] whether
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:16.620] it'll
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:16.760] be
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.160] wetter
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:17.380] or
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:17.860] drier
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.460] in
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:18.920] particular
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.580] areas.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.260] Well,
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:22.520] let
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:22.540] me
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:22.740] just
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:22.900] say
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.100] that.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:23.560] Also,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:24.540] we
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:24.680] don't
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:24.820] have
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:25.040] good
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.440] predictions
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:25.880] for
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.040] the
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:26.480] impacts
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:26.880] on
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.340] hurricanes.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:30.900] More,
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.280] more
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:32.820] intense,
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.360] none
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:33.460] of
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:33.560] the
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.000] above.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:34.880] More
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.160] water
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:35.420] goes
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:35.580] into
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:35.780] the
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:35.960] air
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.260] because
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:36.500] it's
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:36.760] warmer.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:36.960] It
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.160] comes
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:37.440] down.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:37.640] How
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:37.800] does
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:37.940] it
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.100] come
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:38.320] down?
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:38.560] Where
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:38.720] does
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:38.840] it
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.020] come
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:39.280] down?
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.160] Very
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.900] uncertain
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.340] implications
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:43.680] for
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.140] regional
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:44.780] impacts.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:48.820] Regional
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.480] impacts
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.160] will
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.460] take
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:50.680] us
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.020] into
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.360] new
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:51.820] ground,
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.440] particularly
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.340] for
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:53.940] ecosystems.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.560] We
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:55.720] don't
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:55.940] quite
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.400] know
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.180] how
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.100] ecosystems
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.020] will
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:22:59.560] respond
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:22:59.880] because
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.060] we
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:00.440] haven't
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:00.840] done
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.040] it,
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.200] and
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.380] it's
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:01.620] not
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.420] an
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:02.620] easy
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.240] experiment.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:04.380] So
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.820] damages,
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.020] effects
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:07.300] like
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:07.680] rainfall,
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.220] are
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:08.680] uncertain.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.080] The
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:09.680] implications
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.480] of
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:10.780] those
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.280] effects
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.120] are
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:12.480] also
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.000] uncertain.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:14.880] And
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.360] finally,
[00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.790] there's
[00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.110] little
[00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:19.210] experience
[00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:19.710] in
[00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:20.390] how
[00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.710] do
[00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.110] human
[00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.790] civilizations
[00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.290] react

[00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:25.490] kinds.
[00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:26.530] I've
[00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:26.630] been

[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:42.600] Probably

[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.220] How
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:43.600] sensitive?
[00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:45.950] And
[00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:46.350] finally,
[00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.890] the

[00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.630] So
[00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.830] the
[00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.130] czar
[00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:51.350] is

[00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:55.530] that
[00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:55.670] we

[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.040] So
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.260] this
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:58.560] is,
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.100] I
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:23:59.340] now
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:23:59.560] go

[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:02.740] you
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:02.940] can't

[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:08.340] So
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:08.460] the
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:08.640] czar
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.060] can't

[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.300] the

[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:12.880] or
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.020] the

[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:13.720] even
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:13.860] if
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:13.980] he
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.260] could
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:14.560] do
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:14.720] the
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.240] discounting.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.420] A

[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.080] like
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:17.380] this

[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.200] you
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:22.380] can
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:22.640] read
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:22.960] that

[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.580] served.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:30.480] If
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:30.600] you
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:30.780] think
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:31.160] about
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:31.860] steering
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:32.160] a

[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:38.360] to
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:38.660] avoid
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:38.880] the
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.440] Titanic,
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.700] the
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.240] elements
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:42.460] of
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:42.620] what
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:42.760] a
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.160] sensible
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:43.600] skipper
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.140] does
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.580] are
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:44.760] the
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.100] elements
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:45.320] of
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:45.480] what
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:45.660] the
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.040] czar
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.440] would
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:46.720] do
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:46.980] to
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.180] deal
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:47.380] with
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:47.780] climate.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:48.680] You
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.020] slow
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:49.500] down.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:50.600] Good
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.040] plan.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:51.360] So
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:51.760] you
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.160] reduce
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:52.560] emissions.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.460] You
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:54.640] don't
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:54.920] quite
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.340] know
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:55.960] what
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.100] the
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:56.660] consequences
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.000] are,
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:57.180] but
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:57.280] you
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:57.480] know
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:57.780] more
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:58.800] of
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.520] having
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:24:59.760] more
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.100] emissions
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:00.280] or
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:00.400] of
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:00.580] going
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.000] faster,
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.260] but
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:01.380] you
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:01.540] know
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:01.720] they're
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:01.940] probably
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.180] not
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:02.420] good
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:02.600] on
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.140] balance.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:03.900] So
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.020] you
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.320] slow
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:04.660] down.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:05.640] You
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.780] prepare
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.440] for
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.240] something
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:08.500] to
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:08.820] happen.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:09.600] You
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.000] prepare
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.240] to
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:10.700] adapt.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:13.160] You
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:13.640] learn.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:14.340] You
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:14.680] station
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.280] lookouts.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:15.500] You
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:15.780] study
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.020] the
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.340] system.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:16.660] You
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:16.820] see
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.080] what's
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:17.280] going
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:17.720] on.
[00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:19.350] You
[00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.890] develop
[00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:20.910] options,
[00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:21.490] new
[00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.190] technologies,
[00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:23.570] geoengineering,
[00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:23.750] which
[00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.910] I'll
[00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:24.130] talk
[00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:24.350] about
[00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.730] briefly.
[00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.950] And
[00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:26.070] you
[00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.710] try
[00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:27.050] to
[00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:27.290] figure
[00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:27.590] out
[00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.770] a
[00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:28.050] system
[00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.410] that
[00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:28.810] enables
[00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:29.190] learning
[00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.390] to
[00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.690] affect
[00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.310] decisions.
[00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:31.770] So
[00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:31.870] you
[00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:32.010] want
[00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:32.110] to
[00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.350] hear
[00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.550] the
[00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.050] lookouts
[00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:33.610] when
[00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:33.750] they
[00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.990] see
[00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.310] something.
[00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:35.390] So
[00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:35.750] that's
[00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.910] the
[00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:36.370] sort
[00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:36.510] of
[00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.790] thing
[00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.010] the
[00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.350] czar
[00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.730] is
[00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:37.890] going
[00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:37.970] to
[00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:38.150] have
[00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:38.310] to
[00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.750] do,
[00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.010] because
[00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.350] we
[00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:40.490] don't
[00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.630] know
[00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.250] probabilities.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.120] We
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.320] don't
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:43.860] know,
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.100] really,
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:45.680] the
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.160] models
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:46.400] and
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:46.740] studies
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:46.960] of
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.160] what's
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.280] going
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:47.360] to
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:47.560] happen
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:47.680] to
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:47.800] the
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.100] Greenland
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:48.360] ice
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:48.600] sheet,
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:48.860] but
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.020] we
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:50.160] don't
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:50.340] know
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:50.500] for
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:50.740] sure.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.020] We
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:52.160] don't
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:52.300] know
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:52.440] for
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:52.680] sure.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.460] And
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:53.560] we
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:53.720] don't
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:53.960] know
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.160] for
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.380] sure
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:54.620] whether
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:54.880] it's
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.000] going
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.100] to
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:55.280] get
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:55.640] wetter
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:55.800] or
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.180] drier
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:56.360] in
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:56.740] Ethiopia.
[00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.390] So
[00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:01.730] just
[00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.950] a
[00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:02.310] word
[00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.630] about
[00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:03.210] adaptation.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:04.600] The
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:04.800] czar
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:04.980] will
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.200] have
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:05.640] to
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.460] do
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:06.760] some
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:06.860] of
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:07.160] this.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:08.470] But
[00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.530] as
[00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:09.650] I
[00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:09.850] said,
[00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:10.010] the
[00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.310] small
[00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.770] scale,
[00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.490] and
[00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:11.630] we
[00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.790] will
[00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:12.230] adapt.
[00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.430] That
[00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:14.070] first
[00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.390] line
[00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.550] is
[00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:14.690] one
[00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.770] of
[00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:14.950] my
[00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:15.330] favorite
[00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.150] statements
[00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:16.550] about
[00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.090] adaptation,
[00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:17.430] which
[00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.650] is
[00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:18.130] the
[00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:18.510] default
[00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.790] mode
[00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:18.930] of
[00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:19.370] adaptation
[00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.670] is
[00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:20.010] suffering.
[00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:21.470] So
[00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.710] we'll
[00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:22.150] adapt.
[00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:22.570] But
[00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:22.650] the
[00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:22.870] question
[00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:23.070] is,
[00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:23.290] will
[00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:23.510] we
[00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.990] actually
[00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.410] do
[00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:25.730] any
[00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:26.410] changes?
[00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.870] Will
[00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:27.130] we
[00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:27.950] do
[00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:28.150] any
[00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:28.710] proactive
[00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.250] adaptation?
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:31.680] As
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:31.840] I
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.060] said,
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:32.380] problem
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:32.700] one
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:32.860] is
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.000] that
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.380] the
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:33.680] climate
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.120] models
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:34.440] differ.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.020] And
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:35.140] I
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:35.280] will
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:35.460] give
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:35.600] you
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:35.740] an
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.160] example.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.380] A
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:36.840] colleague
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.200] was
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:37.600] called
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:37.820] in
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.000] by
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.200] the
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:38.480] government
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:38.680] of
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.180] Ethiopia
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:39.620] some
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:39.880] years
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.200] ago.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:40.420] And
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:40.540] they
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:40.680] said,
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:40.840] all
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.020] right,
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.420] we
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:42.680] believe
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:42.880] there's
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.000] going
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.080] to
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.220] be
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:43.500] climate
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:43.940] change.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:44.540] What
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:44.640] do
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:44.780] we
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:45.040] do?
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:46.380] Half
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:46.520] the
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:46.800] climate
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.240] models
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:47.640] say
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:47.900] it's
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.020] going
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:48.100] to
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:48.280] get
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:48.780] drier.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.200] And
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:50.460] half
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:50.600] the
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:50.860] climate
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.300] models
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:51.580] say
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:51.840] it's
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:51.980] going
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:52.060] to
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:52.240] get
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:52.600] wetter.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.140] How
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.000] exactly
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.760] do
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:55.960] we
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.360] prepare
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.120] for
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:57.400] this
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:57.860] uncertain
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.340] future?
[00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.750] Their
[00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.150] answer
[00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:01.670] was
[00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:02.050] pave
[00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:02.290] the
[00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:02.730] roads.
[00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.670] Because
[00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:04.930] if
[00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:05.110] it's
[00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.610] drier,
[00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.990] OK,
[00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:06.210] you
[00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:06.370] have
[00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:06.670] paved
[00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:07.070] roads.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.160] If
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:08.400] it's
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.020] wetter,
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:09.260] a
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:09.620] problem
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:09.960] that
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.380] Ethiopia
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.120] traditionally
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:11.560] has
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:11.760] is
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:11.900] that
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.420] unpaved
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:12.700] roads
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.160] wash
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.540] out
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:13.840] when
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.040] there's
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.280] heavy
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:14.800] rainfall.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.480] And
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:15.620] the
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:15.940] whole
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:16.740] process
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.000] of
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.160] getting
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.440] food
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:17.620] to
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:17.840] market
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.160] breaks
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.460] down.
[00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:19.690] So
[00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:19.830] if
[00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.930] it
[00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:20.130] gets
[00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:20.510] wetter,
[00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:20.670] you
[00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:20.850] will
[00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:21.350] really
[00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.690] need
[00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:21.990] paved
[00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.350] roads.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.100] And
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:24.300] if
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:24.480] it
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:24.800] doesn't
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.020] get
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.420] wetter,
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:25.900] paved
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:26.120] roads
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:26.240] are
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:26.380] not
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:26.500] a
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:26.680] bad
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:26.840] thing
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:26.980] to
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:27.360] have.
[00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:29.130] There
[00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:29.190] are
[00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.250] going
[00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:29.310] to
[00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.430] be
[00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.590] a
[00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.830] lot
[00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.970] of
[00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:30.370] decisions
[00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:30.730] like
[00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:30.970] that,
[00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.130] a
[00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.270] lot
[00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:31.370] of
[00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.590] people
[00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.870] looking
[00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:32.150] for
[00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.550] robust
[00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.150] policies.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.360] The
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:34.660] second
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.060] problem,
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:35.280] of
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:35.500] course,
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:35.760] is
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.260] the
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:36.460] czar
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:36.800] can't
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.180] possibly
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:37.460] make
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:37.680] all
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:37.900] these
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.400] decisions.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:39.760] They're
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:39.860] going
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:39.940] to
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:40.080] be
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:40.380] made
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:40.540] at
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:40.820] state
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:40.980] and
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.240] local
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:41.680] levels.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:42.500] A
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:42.840] number
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.120] of
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:43.480] cities
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:43.820] and
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.340] states
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.200] have
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:45.620] now
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:45.940] already,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.080] in
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.200] the
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.420] US
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:46.760] and
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.020] certainly
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:47.340] foreign
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:47.720] countries,
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:48.380] have
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:48.800] now
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.460] processes
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:49.800] in
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.080] place
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:50.260] to
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:50.660] think
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:50.980] about
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:51.340] this,
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.260] to
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:52.440] try
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:52.600] to
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:52.780] think
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.040] about
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:53.380] things
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:53.620] as
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.060] Ethiopia
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.660] did.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:55.520] What
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:55.660] can
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:55.780] we
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:55.940] do
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.160] that's
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:56.700] robust?
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.120] If
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:58.240] we're
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:58.380] going
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:58.480] to
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:58.940] have
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:27:59.580] sea
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:27:59.860] level
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:00.480] rise,
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:00.860] how
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.000] do
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.140] we
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:01.380] cope
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:01.580] with
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:01.960] that?
[00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:03.390] What
[00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:03.490] do
[00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:03.610] we
[00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:03.770] need
[00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:03.890] to
[00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:04.010] do
[00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.310] about
[00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.770] hurricanes?
[00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:05.030] How
[00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:05.190] do
[00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.350] we
[00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.750] change
[00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.170] various
[00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:06.790] policies?
[00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.910] Awful
[00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:08.190] lot
[00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.310] of
[00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.490] that
[00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:08.650] is
[00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:09.030] local.
[00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.110] Awful
[00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.330] lot
[00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:10.410] of
[00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:10.570] that
[00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:10.810] has
[00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:10.950] to
[00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.110] be
[00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.330] local.
[00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.470] And
[00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.610] an
[00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:11.810] awful
[00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:12.030] lot
[00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.130] of
[00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:12.350] that's
[00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.450] going
[00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:12.510] to
[00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:12.630] be
[00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.770] in
[00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:12.930] poor
[00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:13.290] countries.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.240] So
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:16.680] adaptation
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.340] will
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:17.760] happen.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.480] The
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:18.740] czar
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.060] will
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:19.340] try
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:19.460] to
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:19.600] do
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:19.860] something
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:20.180] about
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:20.460] that.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:20.640] But
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:20.960] that,
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:21.660] one
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:21.920] hopes,
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.080] is
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.280] not
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:22.600] enough.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:23.460] One
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:23.800] doubts
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:23.960] it
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.100] will
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:24.280] be
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:24.540] enough
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:24.760] to
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.120] really
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:25.340] get
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:25.480] us
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:25.860] smoothly.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:26.960] New
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.600] technologies,
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.000] you
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.220] guys
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.360] are
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:28.480] going
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:28.600] to
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:28.940] develop
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.180] new
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:29.720] technologies.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.080] That's
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:30.180] going
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:30.260] to
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:30.440] be
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:30.900] terrific.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.280] What's
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:31.420] the
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:31.640] czar
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:31.820] going
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:31.900] to
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:32.020] do
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:32.280] about
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:32.580] that?
[00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:33.310] Well,
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:34.920] governments,
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:35.160] we'll
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.320] come
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:35.560] back
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:35.720] to
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:35.940] some
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.020] of
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:36.220] these
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:36.480] issues.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:36.720] But
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.440] governments
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:37.680] have
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:37.820] a
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.100] terrible
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:38.520] record
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.040] of
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:39.900] pushing
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.120] the
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:40.540] development
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:40.800] of
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.280] civilian
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.100] technologies.
[00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.530] Military
[00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.270] technologies,
[00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.690] space
[00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.270] technologies,
[00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:45.550] where
[00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:45.910] cost
[00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:46.250] doesn't
[00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.630] matter,
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.240] fine.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:48.640] Basic
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.160] research,
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:49.900] fine.
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:50.820] Getting
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.180] stuff
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:51.400] to
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:51.760] market
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.440] at
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:52.580] a
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:52.860] reasonable
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.460] price,
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:54.440] bad
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:54.840] record.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.180] So
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.220] if
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:57.480] you
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:57.940] can't
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.340] adapt
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:58.540] and
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:58.680] you
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:58.980] can't
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.220] solve
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:28:59.340] it
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:28:59.540] with
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.200] technology,
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.060] you've
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.180] got
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:03.300] to
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:03.600] reduce
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.040] emissions.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.440] Why
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:06.620] is
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.020] reducing
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.400] emissions
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:07.840] hard?
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:08.580] First,
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.740] fossil
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.160] fuels.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.380] Another
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:12.700] thing
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:12.860] you
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:13.200] might
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:13.460] think
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:13.740] about
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.060] doing
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:14.280] and
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:14.480] you've
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:14.700] probably
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.020] read
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:15.380] about
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:15.620] is
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.560] geoengineering.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.440] The
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:19.780] simplest
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.000] way
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.100] to
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.280] think
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:20.500] about
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:20.720] that
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:20.900] is
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.360] artificial
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:21.960] volcanoes.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:22.260] You
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:22.540] might
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.040] put
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:23.720] sulfate.
[00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.710] When
[00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.950] Mount
[00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:26.570] Pinatubo
[00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.950] blew
[00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:27.310] up,
[00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:28.290] as
[00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:28.430] I
[00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.750] understand
[00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.030] it,
[00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.190] there
[00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.390] was
[00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:29.550] a
[00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.130] discernible
[00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:30.610] cooling.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.160] Small
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:32.700] particles,
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.600] aerosols
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.460] in
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:34.620] the
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.140] stratosphere
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:35.600] reflect
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.060] sunlight.
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:36.900] So
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.200] why
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:37.380] don't
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:37.540] we
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:37.780] just
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:38.340] either
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:38.620] burn
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:38.860] more
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.220] coal
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:39.680] or
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.240] take
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:41.520] the
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:41.900] 16
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.120]-inch
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:42.380] guns
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:42.600] from
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.100] battleships
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:43.300] that
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:43.460] aren't
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:43.580] in
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:43.780] use
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.100] anymore,
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:44.480] turn
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:44.640] them
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:44.820] up,
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:44.980] and
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:45.340] fire
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:45.880] aerosols
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.120] into
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:46.320] the
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:46.940] stratosphere?
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:47.820] This
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:47.920] is
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.020] a
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:48.280] serious
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:48.740] proposal
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.560] to
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.160] reflect
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:50.600] sunlight.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.000] Well,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.480] you
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:53.660] might
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:53.820] want
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:53.900] to
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.040] have
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.200] that
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:54.280] in
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:54.380] your
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:54.580] back
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:54.860] pocket
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.100] for
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:55.500] emergencies.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:55.960] But
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.560] first
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:56.700] of
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:56.980] all,
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:57.440] if
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:57.560] you
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:57.780] have
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.000] more
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.460] CO2
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:58.600] in
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:58.720] the
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.120] atmosphere,
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:29:59.360] the
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:29:59.580] ocean
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:29:59.960] becomes
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.200] more
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:00.540] acidic
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:00.740] and
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.040] creatures
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:01.520] die.
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.460] Doesn't
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:02.720] solve
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:02.940] that
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:03.280] problem.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:03.860] And
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:04.200] second,
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:04.640] if
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:04.740] you
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:04.920] don't
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.220] reduce
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:05.580] emissions,
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:05.800] you've
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:05.900] got
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.000] to
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.160] keep
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.400] doing
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:06.640] more
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:06.780] and
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:06.960] more
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.120] of
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.400] that.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:07.780] And
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:07.920] that
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.120] does
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:08.340] not
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:08.600] sound
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:08.860] like
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.560] a
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:09.840] long
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.080]-term
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.400] way
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:10.820] forward.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:11.900] So
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.300] CO2
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:13.520] is
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:13.660] where
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:13.840] the
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.220] policy
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:14.600] focus
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:14.920] is
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.200] because,
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:15.540] as
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:15.680] we
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:15.880] saw
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.100] from
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:16.320] those
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:16.600] earlier
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.020] graphs,
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.680] it's
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:17.920] quite
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.380] important.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:18.640] It
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:18.940] lasts
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.140] a
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:19.320] long
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.860] time.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.120] We
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.380] can
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:21.980] measure
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:22.860] fossil
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.220] fuel
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:23.520] use
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:23.860] pretty
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:24.360] easily.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.420] Think
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:25.580] about
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:25.940] countries
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.080] that
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.380] import
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:26.580] all
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:26.720] their
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.020] oil.
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.020] You
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:30.200] can
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:30.520] measure
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.160] imports
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.020] pretty
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:32.640] easily
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:32.960] at
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.180] the
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:33.660] ports
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.140] where
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:34.320] they
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:34.700] happen.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:35.980] You
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.320] may
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:36.540] be
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:36.960] wrong,
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:37.260] plus
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:37.420] or
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:37.700] minus
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.220] inventory
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.840] accumulation,
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:39.320] but
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:39.520] it's
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:39.760] not
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.060] easy
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:40.300] to
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:40.560] carry
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:40.800] and
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.080] not
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.400] cheap
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:41.600] to
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:41.840] carry
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.520] inventories
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:42.900] of
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.580] crude
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:43.800] oil
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:43.940] and
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.280] refined
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:44.780] product.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:45.640] So
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:45.980] it's
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.260] not,
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:46.640] in
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:46.800] terms
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:46.960] of
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.580] internationally
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.420] enforceable
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.000] agreements,
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:49.700] fossil
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.040] fuel
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:50.200] is
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:50.460] pretty
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:50.920] easy
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.720] compared
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:52.980] to
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:53.260] anything
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:53.560] else
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:53.700] you
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:53.840] want
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:53.940] to
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.100] think
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:54.360] about.
[00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:56.510] Another
[00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:56.850] reason
[00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:56.990] you
[00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.330] focus
[00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:57.610] on
[00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:57.730] it
[00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:57.970] is,
[00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.130] we
[00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.430] talked
[00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.830] about
[00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.030] last
[00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:00.350] week,
[00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:01.290] not
[00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:01.590] only
[00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.790] does
[00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:02.910] it
[00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:03.270] involve
[00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:03.790] durable
[00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:04.390] assets,
[00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.990] can
[00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.350] last
[00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.510] a
[00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:06.730] long
[00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:07.090] time,
[00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.590] that
[00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.710] are
[00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.310] expensive,
[00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:09.350] and
[00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.570] thus
[00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.010] expensive
[00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.270] to
[00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:10.650] replace
[00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:11.050] early,
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.060] but
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:13.200] there
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:13.280] are
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:13.520] all
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:13.700] these
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:13.960] other
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.280] path
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:14.880] dependencies
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.360] that
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:16.780] keep
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:16.980] you
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.260] down
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:17.440] a
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:17.920] path.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:18.560] So
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:18.920] the
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.040] energy
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:20.480] system
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:20.820] is
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.080] a
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:21.960] slow
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.400] ship
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:22.620] to
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:22.960] turn.
[00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.830] And
[00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.970] if
[00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:24.170] you
[00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:24.690] need
[00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:24.890] to
[00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:25.090] turn
[00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:25.230] it
[00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.550] because
[00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:25.790] its
[00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:26.170] impacts
[00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:26.530] last
[00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:26.790] 100
[00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:27.290] years,
[00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:27.910] and
[00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:28.070] if
[00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.230] you
[00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.610] can
[00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.930] turn
[00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:29.150] it
[00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:29.650] because
[00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:29.890] you
[00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:30.090] can
[00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:30.570] monitor
[00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:30.890] and
[00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:31.350] enforce,
[00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:32.350] that's
[00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.510] a
[00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.910] logical
[00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:33.350] place
[00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.570] to
[00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:33.890] focus.
[00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:36.830] Why
[00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.990] is
[00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.190] that
[00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.530] problem
[00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:37.870] hard?
[00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:38.970] Why
[00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:39.130] is
[00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:39.250] it
[00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:39.510] hard
[00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:39.730] to
[00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:40.470] change
[00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.890] emissions?
[00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:41.170] Well,
[00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.330] we
[00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.610] talked
[00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:41.850] about
[00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:42.070] that.
[00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:42.290] This
[00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.190] is
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.560] some
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:44.920] color
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.360]-coded,
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:45.700] not
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.100] very
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:46.300] well
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:46.620] color
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.080]-coded,
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:47.840] emissions
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.680] trajectories
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.220] on
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:49.420] the
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:49.820] left,
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:51.700] matched
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.080] with
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:52.680] atmospheric
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.280] CO2
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:53.960] concentrations
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.320] on
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:54.480] the
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:54.860] right,
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:55.740] and
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.180] matched
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:56.540] down
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.080] here,
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:57.940] except
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:58.460] for
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:58.780] the
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.180] really
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:31:59.700] aggressive
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.260] reduction
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:00.960] scenario,
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:01.800] matched
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.340] with
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.280] temperature
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:03.880] increases.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:05.920] So
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.640] the
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:06.960] world
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.320] runs
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:07.560] on
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:07.860] fossil
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:08.400] fuels,
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:08.980] to
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.100] a
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:09.340] first
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:09.860] approximation.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:10.260] You
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:10.580] saw
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:10.960] all
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.420] those
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.260] Lawrence
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:14.720] Livermore

[00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.990] of
[00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.210] energy.
[00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:19.670] Most
[00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:19.830] of
[00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.030] it's
[00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:20.370] fossil.
[00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.350] The
[00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.630] world
[00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:21.990] runs
[00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.270] on
[00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:22.610] fossil
[00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:23.170] fuels.
[00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:23.890] Big
[00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:24.290] emission
[00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:24.650] cuts
[00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:25.070] are
[00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.330] needed
[00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:25.510] if
[00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:25.650] you're
[00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:25.730] going
[00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:25.830] to
[00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:26.250] reduce
[00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:26.970] temperature.
[00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:27.350] Take
[00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.590] the,
[00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.390] you
[00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:28.590] might
[00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.850] think
[00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:29.010] of
[00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:29.210] the
[00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.830] orange
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.000] kind
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.240] of
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:31.440] as
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:31.680] an
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.060] estimate
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:32.320] of
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:32.660] business
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:32.860] as
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.260] usual,
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:33.740] maybe,
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.080] somebody's
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:35.420] estimate.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.080] The
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:36.400] blue,
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:36.740] then,
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:36.920] is
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.060] a
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:37.240] pretty
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:37.660] aggressive
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.120] cut.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.360] But
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:39.740] look
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.040] what,
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:40.720] and
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:40.860] the
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.040] blue
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:41.460] relative
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:41.720] to
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:41.920] the
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.320] orange
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.100] at
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:43.240] the
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:43.400] end
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:43.500] of
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:43.640] the
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:43.960] century
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.220] has
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:44.360] a
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:44.520] pretty
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:44.780] big
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:45.160] impact
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:45.360] on
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:45.960] atmospheric
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.060] concentrations.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:48.960] But
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.200] the
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:49.580] temperature
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.020] still
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:50.320] goes
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:50.640] up.
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.340] The
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:51.680] temperature
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.040] still
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:52.280] goes
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:52.520] up
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.020] substantially.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:53.520] That's
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:53.660] a
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:53.820] 2
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.240] degree,
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:55.440] or
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:55.480] is
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:55.580] that
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:55.720] a
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:55.960] 3
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.280] degree
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:56.720] increase
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:56.940] in
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.320] temperature?
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:57.600] 3
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:57.940] degrees
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.720] Fahrenheit
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.340] increase
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:32:59.540] in
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:32:59.920] temperature.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.120] The
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:01.640] orange,
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:02.360] much
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:02.680] bigger.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:03.300] But
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:03.560] that's
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:03.720] a
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.180] big
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:04.920] change.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.420] If
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:05.560] you're
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:05.720] going
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:05.980] from
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.260] here
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:06.380] to
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:06.700] here,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:08.660] China's
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:08.880] not
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.120] getting
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.500] rich

[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:11.780] on
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.320] the
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:12.520] blue
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:12.920] path.
[00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:14.050] We're
[00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:14.350] not
[00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:15.490] increasing
[00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:15.730] our
[00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:16.050] energy
[00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:16.470] at
[00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.830] all,
[00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.410] probably.
[00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:18.810] Europe
[00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:19.050] is
[00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:19.270] cutting
[00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:19.570] back
[00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:19.830] even
[00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.210] farther
[00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.530] to
[00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:20.730] get
[00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:20.890] to
[00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:21.090] that
[00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:21.330] blue
[00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:21.790] path.
[00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:22.270] That's
[00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:22.450] a
[00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:22.890] big
[00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:23.310] deal.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:25.320] So
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:25.440] if
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:25.560] it's
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:25.680] the
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.020] easiest
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:26.320] thing
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:26.460] to
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:26.680] do,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:26.800] and
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:26.940] it's
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.060] an
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:27.340] important
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:27.580] thing
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:27.740] to
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:27.920] do,
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.180] it's
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:28.300] a
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:28.480] big
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:28.780] deal.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:29.840] So
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.100] that's
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.360] one
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:30.660] reason
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:30.960] why
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.140] it's
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:31.500] hard,
[00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.750] is
[00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.910] we
[00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.110] live
[00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.330] on
[00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:33.610] fossil
[00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:34.050] fuels.
[00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.910] So
[00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:35.030] if
[00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.190] you're
[00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.230] going
[00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:35.370] to
[00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:35.610] cut
[00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:35.990] the
[00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.470] use
[00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.690] of
[00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:37.410] fossil
[00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:37.830] fuels,
[00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:38.210] emissions
[00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.450] from
[00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.770] fossil
[00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:39.230] fuels,
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:40.640] it's
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.020] emissions
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:41.280] from
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:41.560] fossil
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:41.980] fuels.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.020] You
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:43.160] could
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:43.300] do
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:43.480] some
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:43.720] fuel
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.100] switching.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:44.340] You
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:44.500] can
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:44.640] do
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:44.840] some
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.320] efficiency.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:45.580] You
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:45.740] can
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:45.960] do
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.220] some
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:46.500] this,
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:46.780] that,
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:46.880] and
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.000] the
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.180] other.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:47.400] But
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:47.600] you
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:47.720] will
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:47.900] have
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.020] to
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:48.160] do
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:48.300] a
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:48.540] lot.
[00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:50.570] New
[00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.090] technologies
[00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:51.350] will
[00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.510] be
[00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:51.890] essential,
[00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:52.170] but
[00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:52.510] they
[00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:52.870] may
[00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.990] or
[00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.090] may
[00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.270] not
[00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:53.590] appear
[00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.770] in
[00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:54.010] time.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.000] OK,
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:57.320] so
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:57.580] that's
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:57.680] a
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:57.820] big
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:58.080] deal.
[00:33:59.050 --> 00:33:59.310] So
[00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.470] we
[00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.630] all
[00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.730] go
[00:33:59.730 --> 00:33:59.850] to
[00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:00.250] bicycles.
[00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:00.890] That's
[00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:01.170] great.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:02.520] We
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:02.680] can
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:02.820] do
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:03.160] that.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:03.860] We
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.020] can
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.360] emulate
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:04.600] the
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:04.840] Dutch,
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:04.980] and
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:05.080] we
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.200] can
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:05.360] all
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:05.760] bicycle
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:05.960] to
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.240] work.
[00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:08.370] But
[00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:08.670] we're
[00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:08.870] not
[00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:09.070] the
[00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:09.510] problem.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:12.840] Any
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.400] projection
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:13.680] of
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:13.840] the
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.180] future
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:14.780] says
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:15.580] the
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:15.960] growth
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.180] in
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:16.580] emissions
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:16.840] will
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.140] come
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:17.360] from
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:17.780] countries
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:17.960] that
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.040] are
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.280] now
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.800] poor.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:19.780] They
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:20.020] have
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.180] been
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:20.440] growing
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:20.700] more
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:21.040] rapidly
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:21.260] than
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:21.620] countries
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:21.780] that
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:21.860] are
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.080] now
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.360] rich
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:22.520] for
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:22.780] some
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.140] time.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:23.740] And
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:24.040] all
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:24.500] projections
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:24.820] are
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.000] they
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.180] will
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:25.600] continue
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:25.880] to
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.080] do
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:26.340] so.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:26.640] So
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:26.860] this
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.100] is
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:27.400] from
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.100] BP's
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.440] Energy
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:28.880] Outlook.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.000] If
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.200] you
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:30.560] look
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.760] up
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:31.960] to
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.700] 2010,
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.020] it's
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.460] 1990
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:34.780] to
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.160] 2010,
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:35.420] you'll
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:35.680] see
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.700] OECD
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.140] emissions,
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.460] rich
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:37.800] country
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.240] emissions,
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.300] pretty
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:39.900] flat.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:40.400] I
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:40.720] mean,
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.620] they'd
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:41.740] be
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:41.920] up
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.080] a
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:42.280] bit
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:42.700] but
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:42.880] for
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.060] the
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:43.480] recession,
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:44.260] but
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:44.600] not
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.020] much,
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:45.880] but
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.600] dramatic
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.240] growth
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.060] in
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:49.220] the
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:49.440] less
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:49.680] rich
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.160] countries,
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:51.580] dramatic
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.040] growth.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:52.760] Again,
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:52.920] for
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.080] the
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:53.340] world
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:53.540] as
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:53.680] a
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.120] whole,
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:55.160] energy
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:55.420] and
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:55.840] CO2
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.080] have
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:56.580] grown
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:56.920] less
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.340] rapidly
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:57.640] than
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.140] GDP.
[00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:59.240] That
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.080] declining
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.260] we
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:01.500] saw
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:01.640] in
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:01.760] the
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:01.960] US
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.280] is
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:02.440] a
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:02.740] general
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.260] phenomenon.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.020] But
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.420] if
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:07.560] you
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.600] don't,
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.140] if
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:09.240] you
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:09.780] try
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.360] to
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:10.820] control
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.360] global
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:11.820] emissions,
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:12.280] try
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:12.440] to
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:12.800] reduce
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.240] global
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:13.700] emissions
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:14.280] by
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:14.760] reducing
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.460] OECD
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:15.960] emissions,
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:16.500] you
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:16.700] see
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:16.920] if
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.320] we

[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:30.900] So
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.220] yeah,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:31.680] Sam.
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:40.740] You

[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.300] say,
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:42.800] well,
[00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:44.450] what
[00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.530] are
[00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:44.650] they
[00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:44.950] assuming?
[00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:45.190] They're

[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.330] They're
[00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:48.670] assuming
[00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:49.170] something
[00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:49.430] in

[00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:50.670] They're

[00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.510] They're
[00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.990] not
[00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.450] assuming

[00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:57.050] you
[00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.290] guys
[00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.410] are
[00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.550] going

[00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.610] That's
[00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:00.890] clear.
[00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:01.110] They're
[00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:01.550] not
[00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.110] assuming
[00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.050] sort
[00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.410] of

[00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.550] whole
[00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.970] world.
[00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:08.170] I
[00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:08.570] think,
[00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:09.950] and
[00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:10.130] it's
[00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.230] an
[00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.470] interesting
[00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.930] assumption
[00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:11.190] to
[00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.590] assume
[00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:11.870] that
[00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:12.270] absent
[00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.790] anything
[00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:13.250] going
[00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.710] on
[00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.250] in
[00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:14.490] these
[00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:14.930] countries,
[00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:15.710] that
[00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.970] these
[00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:16.310] countries
[00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.530] will
[00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:17.030] continue.
[00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:17.330] I
[00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:17.470] mean,
[00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.830] they're
[00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:18.110] showing
[00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:18.250] a
[00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:18.690] reduction,
[00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.970] a
[00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:19.290] positive
[00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:19.830] reduction
[00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:20.050] in
[00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:20.390] emissions
[00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.710] here
[00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.870] over
[00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:21.110] that
[00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:21.490] period.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:22.380] So
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:22.620] that
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.060] is,
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:23.500] and
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:23.700] there's
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.040] growth,
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:24.340] not
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:24.660] huge
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:24.940] growth,
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.160] but
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.360] there's
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:25.740] growth.
[00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:26.750] So
[00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:27.030] they're
[00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.370] assuming
[00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:27.630] a
[00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.910] tightening
[00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:28.110] in
[00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:28.230] the
[00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.890] OECD,
[00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.950] continued
[00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:30.630] efficiency
[00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:31.290] increases
[00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:31.750] here.
[00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.410] Some,
[00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:34.890] there's
[00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:35.090] some
[00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:35.550] discussion
[00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.890] of
[00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:36.490] China
[00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:36.950] becoming
[00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:37.150] a
[00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.310] bit
[00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:38.610] less
[00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:38.910] carbon
[00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:39.330] intensive.
[00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.710] But
[00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.470] the
[00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.770] main

[00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.590] actions
[00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:41.870] here,
[00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:42.130] and
[00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:42.310] they
[00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.550] do
[00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.790] not
[00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:43.090] assume
[00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:43.210] a

[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.460] It's
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:47.600] a
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:47.860] short
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.320] description.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:48.840] I
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.080] invite
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:49.240] you
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:49.380] to
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:49.560] read
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:49.740] it.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.060] It's
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:50.280] about
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:50.500] two
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:50.820] pages.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:51.460] See
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:51.620] what
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:52.280] you
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:52.520] think
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:52.720] they
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.060] assume.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:53.680] But
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:53.920] that's
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.040] how
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.220] I
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:54.340] get,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:54.560] that's
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:54.660] what
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:54.780] I
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:54.900] get
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:55.060] out
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:55.160] of
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:55.300] it.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:55.840] You
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.000] can
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.160] see
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:56.620] they're
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.080] continuing
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:57.540] to
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:57.880] assume
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.060] for
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:58.260] the
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:58.520] world
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:58.740] as
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:58.860] a

[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.700] efficiency
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.420] increases,
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:02.880] right?
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.380] The
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:03.940] GDP
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.360] grows
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:04.740] much
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:04.980] more
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.340] rapidly
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:05.580] than
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:05.860] energy
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.240] use.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:07.220] And
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:07.480] they're
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:07.960] continuing
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.320] to
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:08.660] assume
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:08.820] for
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.000] the
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.200] world
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:09.400] as
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:09.520] a
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:09.780] whole
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.880] decarbonization,
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:11.680] presumably,
[00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:13.810] presumably
[00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:14.050] a
[00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:14.410] switch
[00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:14.790] out
[00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.950] of

[00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:16.270] and
[00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.790] renewables.
[00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:17.050] I'd
[00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:17.190] have
[00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.350] to
[00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:17.550] go
[00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.810] back
[00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.990] and
[00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.210] check.
[00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.390] But
[00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.550] I
[00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.730] think
[00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:19.010] that's
[00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.290] part
[00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:19.430] of
[00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.650] the
[00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:20.170] scenario.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.120] Anything
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:22.360] else?
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:22.580] Yeah.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.040] Methane
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:32.600] has
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:32.860] a,
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:34.440] the
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:34.660] reason
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:34.960] for
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.180] not
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:35.600] focusing
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:35.920] on
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.280] methane,
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:36.720] even
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.220] though
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.740] it
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.060] is
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.200] a
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:40.360] more
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:40.780] potent
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.080] heat
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:41.500] trapping
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:41.940] gas,
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:42.100] it
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:42.360] doesn't
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:42.580] stay
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:42.700] in
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:42.820] the
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:43.220] atmosphere
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:43.480] as
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:43.780] long.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.140] A,
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:45.720] 10
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:45.880]-year
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.160] half
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:46.380]-life
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:46.660] by
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:47.220] ballpark,
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:47.520] about
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:47.780] 10
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.060] years.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.320] And
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:49.760] B,
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.200] it's
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:50.600] harder
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:50.940] to
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.260] figure.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:51.500] It
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:51.640] has
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:51.900] many
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:52.320] sources.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.180] So
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:53.300] it's
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:53.540] got
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:54.460] natural
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:54.820] gas
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.200] leaks.
[00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:56.490] It's
[00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:56.970] got
[00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:58.330] landfill
[00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:59.250] decomposition.
[00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.830] It's
[00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.090] got
[00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:00.430] things
[00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.910] rotting.
[00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.450] So
[00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:01.730] it's
[00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:02.230] harder
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.660] to
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.300] control.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:04.760] And
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:04.880] in
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.180] fact,
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:05.980] in

[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.560] less
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.100] serious.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:11.800] Please.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.300] AUDIENCE
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:12.300] 2
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:12.300] The
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.060] confusion
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:14.840] is
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:15.760] that,
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:16.420] although
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.000] every
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:17.460] molecule
[00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:19.610] is
[00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:19.910] more
[00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:20.330] potent
[00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:20.550] than
[00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.730] a
[00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:21.130] molecule
[00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:21.370] of
[00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:21.910] CO2,
[00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.730] there's
[00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.910] a
[00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:23.130] lot
[00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:23.390] more
[00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.810] CO2
[00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.950] in
[00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:24.030] the
[00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:24.410] atmosphere.
[00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:24.830] So
[00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:25.390] actually,
[00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:26.390] CO2
[00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.570] is
[00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:26.770] doing
[00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:27.130] three
[00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:27.590] times
[00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:28.050] more
[00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:28.530] warming
[00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.770] than
[00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:29.950] the
[00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:30.410] total
[00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.590] of

[00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.050] methane
[00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:31.670] because
[00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:32.030] there's
[00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.210] so
[00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.410] much
[00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:32.690] more
[00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.890] of
[00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:33.050] it,
[00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.410] even
[00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:33.770] though
[00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:34.210] each

[00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:35.030] molecule
[00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.350] is
[00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:35.690] OK.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:37.980] So
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:38.420] it's
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:38.460] not
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:38.460] the

[00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:15.490] the
[00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:16.050] OECD
[00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:16.530] countries
[00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:17.290] are
[00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:17.730] much
[00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:18.070] higher.
[00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.650] But
[00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:20.270] the
[00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.450] only
[00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.790] point
[00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.950] to
[00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:21.070] be
[00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:21.310] made
[00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:21.630] here
[00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.950] is,
[00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.470] if
[00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.610] you
[00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:22.870] want
[00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:23.110] this
[00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:23.670] top
[00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.170] graph
[00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.370] to
[00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:24.590] come
[00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:24.970] down,
[00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:26.190] you're
[00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.370] not
[00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:26.530] going
[00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:26.630] to
[00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.830] get
[00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:26.950] it
[00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:27.130] all
[00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:27.450] here.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:28.620] And
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.000] you've
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:29.180] got
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:29.280] to
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:29.440] do
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:29.680] something
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:29.940] up
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:30.220] here
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.040] somehow,
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.420] somehow.
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.180] We
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:35.320] will
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:35.540] come
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:35.700] to
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:36.060] questions
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:36.280] of
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:36.540] fairness
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:36.800] in
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.000] about
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.140] a
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:37.320] half
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:37.460] a
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:37.740] second.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:40.880] So
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.400] that's
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:41.640] a
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.120] reason.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:44.140] You're
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.260] going
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:44.360] to
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:44.540] have
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:44.700] to
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:44.920] deal
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.180] with
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:45.700] growth.
[00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:46.970] And
[00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:47.150] the
[00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.390] growth
[00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.590] is
[00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:47.690] going
[00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:47.810] to
[00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:48.030] come
[00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.230] from
[00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.290] countries
[00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:49.590] that
[00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:49.710] are
[00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:50.030] now
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.600] poorer
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.040] than
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:52.200] the
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:52.740] OECD
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.200] countries.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:54.480] The
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:54.760] other
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.140] reason,
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:55.420] let
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:55.540] me
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:55.780] just
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.400] briefly
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.280] do
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:57.440] a
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:57.580] little
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.120] economics
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:58.460] here,
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:58.620] as
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:58.900] opposed
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.120] to
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:39:59.660] a
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:39:59.840] little
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.660] pseudoscience.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.440] Suppose
[00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:04.610] you
[00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:04.910] want
[00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:05.050] to
[00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:05.750] reduce
[00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:06.610] emissions.
[00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:08.350] Say
[00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:08.510] you
[00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.710] want
[00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.870] a
[00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:09.230] total
[00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.870] reduction
[00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:10.650] emissions
[00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:11.710] of
[00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:12.190] from
[00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.630] business
[00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.850] as
[00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:13.250] usual
[00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.570] of
[00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:13.970] capital
[00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:14.350] R.
[00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:15.770] And
[00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.890] you
[00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:16.010] want
[00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.090] to
[00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:16.230] do
[00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.370] it
[00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.810] worldwide.
[00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:17.330] And
[00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:17.530] the
[00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:17.950] cost
[00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:18.130] of
[00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:18.350] getting
[00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:18.930] reductions
[00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:19.190] in
[00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.590] country
[00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:19.990] i
[00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.210] is
[00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.430] given
[00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.690] by
[00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.950] this
[00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:21.250] cost
[00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:21.630] function.
[00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:22.830] All
[00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:23.010] right,
[00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:23.150] so
[00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.370] the
[00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:23.610] czar
[00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:24.150] cares
[00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.470] about
[00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.910] global
[00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:25.490] cost.
[00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:26.630] So
[00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.850] what
[00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:27.030] the
[00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.350] czar
[00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:27.490] is
[00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:27.650] going
[00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.790] to
[00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:28.190] do
[00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.510] is
[00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.270] reduce
[00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.770] emissions.
[00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:30.070] He's
[00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:30.230] going
[00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.750] to
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:31.840] minimize
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.260] the
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:32.540] total
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.140] cost
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:33.920] subject
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.220] to
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:34.500] this
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.000] constraint.
[00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:37.270] And
[00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.170] if
[00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:38.670] you
[00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.370] recall,
[00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:40.190] or
[00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.430] just
[00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.670] use
[00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.830] your
[00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:41.350] intuition,
[00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:42.110] you're
[00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:42.190] going
[00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.290] to
[00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:42.510] have
[00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:42.630] to
[00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.830] have
[00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:43.030] the
[00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.490] marginal
[00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.910] cost,
[00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.130] the
[00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:44.510] derivative
[00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.890] of
[00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:45.170] this
[00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.530] function
[00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.750] with
[00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:46.070] respect
[00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:46.290] to
[00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:46.470] its
[00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.910] argument,
[00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:47.670] equal
[00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.090] across
[00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:48.550] countries.
[00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:50.170] If
[00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:50.590] not,
[00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.970] I
[00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:51.130] can
[00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:51.750] rearrange
[00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.070] reductions
[00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:53.410] in
[00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:53.510] a
[00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.670] way
[00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.910] that'll
[00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:54.110] lower
[00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:54.670] cost.
[00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:55.510] I'll
[00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.670] do
[00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.830] a
[00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:55.990] little

[00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:57.450] is

[00:40:59.330 --> 00:40:59.490] is
[00:40:59.490 --> 00:40:59.730] high,
[00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.930] get
[00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:00.110] the
[00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:00.310] same
[00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:00.770] reductions,
[00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.150] lower
[00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.690] cost.
[00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:02.530] That's
[00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:02.930] always
[00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:03.290] true
[00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.550] unless
[00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.790] the

[00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.670] are

[00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:07.330] If

[00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.370] are

[00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:09.170] equal,
[00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:10.190] then
[00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.530] unless
[00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:10.850] it's
[00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:11.530] really
[00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.050] hard
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.620] to
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.140] reduce
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:14.860] emissions
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.120] in
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:15.360] poor
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:15.800] countries,
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:16.380] they
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:16.640] have
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:16.800] to
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.160] play
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:17.340] if
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:17.460] we're
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:17.600] going
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:17.720] to
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:18.020] reduce
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:18.340] total
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:18.800] cost.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.360] It's
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:20.520] not
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:20.660] a
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:20.880] question
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.060] of
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:21.200] who
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:21.780] pays
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.080] for
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:22.320] it.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:23.400] It's
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:23.500] a
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:23.700] question
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:23.840] of
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.000] where
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:24.120] it
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.640] happens.
[00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:27.030] Doesn't
[00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.430] say
[00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.970] that
[00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:28.870] Bangladesh
[00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:29.410] has
[00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:29.590] to
[00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:29.910] pay
[00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:30.110] to
[00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:30.490] reduce
[00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:30.950] emissions
[00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:31.170] in
[00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:31.610] Bangladesh.
[00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.610] It
[00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.170] says
[00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.890] that
[00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:34.230] emissions
[00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.470] in
[00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.830] Bangladesh
[00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:35.170] will
[00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:35.370] have
[00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:35.490] to
[00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:35.690] be
[00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:36.130] reduced.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:37.720] So
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.000] there's
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.320] separate
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:38.900] questions.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:39.540] But
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:39.700] it
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:39.900] says
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.100] the
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:40.400] poor
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:40.600] will
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:40.820] need
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:40.920] to
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.100] be
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:41.640] involved.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:42.860] This
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.240] is,
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.720] if
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:46.740] you
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:47.360] recall,
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:48.820] 14
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:49.040].01,
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:49.320] if
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:49.420] you
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:49.580] have
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:49.740] a
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:49.920] firm
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.340] producing
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:50.560] in
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:50.880] multiple
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.400] plants,
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:51.640] this
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:51.760] is
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.200] exactly
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:52.480] the
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:52.880] same
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.000] principle.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:55.280] You
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:55.480] want
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:55.620] to
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.280] equalize
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:56.540] on
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:56.680] the
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.100] margin.
[00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:00.130] Normally,
[00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:00.390] it
[00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.590] means
[00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:00.890] everybody
[00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:01.170] has
[00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:01.310] to
[00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.590] play.
[00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:04.070] There
[00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:04.250] are
[00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.670] two
[00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:05.870] approaches
[00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:06.250] that
[00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:06.410] have
[00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.570] been
[00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:06.850] put
[00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:07.030] on
[00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.210] the
[00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:07.470] table
[00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.690] for
[00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:07.930] this.
[00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:08.030] And
[00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.170] we'll
[00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:08.410] come
[00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:09.650] back
[00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.810] to
[00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:10.230] both
[00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.450] of
[00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:10.630] them.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:11.660] The
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.860] Parsons
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.060] et
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:13.220] al
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:13.560] piece
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:13.760] on
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:13.880] the
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.100] reading
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:14.360] list,
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:14.540] which
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:14.720] is
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.100] optional,
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:15.480] talks
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:15.900] about
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.560] one
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:17.680] of
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:17.840] them.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.080] You
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:19.260] could
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:19.560] say,
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:19.720] all
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:19.860] right,
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:20.060] how
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:20.380] about
[00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:22.390] the
[00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.810] czar
[00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:23.610] says,
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.020] there's
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:27.160] a
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:27.440] price
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:27.640] of
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.060] $20
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:28.620] a
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:28.900] ton
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:29.100] for
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:29.480] carbon
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:29.920] emissions
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.160] from
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:30.480] fossil
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:30.900] fuels.
[00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.250] The
[00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:33.490] czar
[00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:33.870] doesn't
[00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:34.090] like
[00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:34.250] to
[00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.430] do
[00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.750] central
[00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:35.190] planning.
[00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.510] He's
[00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.710] learned
[00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:37.970] that
[00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:38.330] lesson.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:39.460] But
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:39.640] the
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:39.840] czar
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.060] can
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.280] tinker
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:40.480] with
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:40.780] prices.
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:41.000] So
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.160] he'll
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:41.320] put
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:41.440] a
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:41.660] price
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:41.800] of
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.080] $20
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:42.540] a
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:42.880] ton
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.200] for
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:43.660] emissions.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.360] Well,
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:46.880] that
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.200] means
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:47.680] everybody
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.020] who's
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.080] contemplating
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:49.520] emissions
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.060] is
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:50.220] going
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:50.360] to
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:50.680] cut
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.200] back
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.040] until
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:52.280] the
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:52.560] cost
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:52.720] of
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:52.940] cutting
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:53.380] back
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:54.180] rises
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:54.440] to
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:54.780] $20.
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:56.580] And
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:56.800] I'll
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.120] get
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:57.760] this
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.260] marginal
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:58.660] cost
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:42:59.120] equality
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.420] that
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:00.720] way.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:02.680] So
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:02.780] I
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:02.880] just
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.240] price
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:03.400] the
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:03.620] thing.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:03.800] We
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.020] talked
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:04.280] about
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:04.500] this
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:04.840] earlier.
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:05.120] This
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:05.280] is
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:05.640] pricing
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:05.840] the
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.100] harm.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:07.140] So
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:07.240] I
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:07.540] price
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:07.700] the
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:07.980] harm.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:08.260] People
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:08.540] cut
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:08.800] back
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:08.940] on
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:09.100] the
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:09.380] harm.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.140] It's
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:11.240] a
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:11.620] tax.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:11.860] It'll
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.080] show
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:12.260] up
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:12.380] as
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:12.500] a
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:12.760] tax
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:12.960] on
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.240] probably
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:13.460] show
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:13.560] up
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:13.660] as
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:13.760] a
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:13.960] tax
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.160] on
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:14.520] fuel.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:16.660] Tax
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:16.940] much
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:17.260] higher
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:17.460] on
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:17.760] coal
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:17.940] than
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:18.060] on
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:18.360] natural
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:18.800] gas.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.000] But
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:19.220] that's
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:19.380] one
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:19.520] way
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:19.640] to
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:19.820] do
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:19.960] it.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.060] And
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:21.480] the
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:21.760] czar
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.460] can
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:22.620] do
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:22.820] that.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:22.980] The
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.120] other
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.260] way
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:23.400] to
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:23.560] do
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:23.740] it,
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.080] that
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:26.320] makes
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:26.580] sense,
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:26.800] right?
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.060] That's
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:27.300] easy.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.020] We'll
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:28.120] just
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:28.460] price
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:28.620] the
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:28.820] thing.
[00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.950] The
[00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:32.150] other
[00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.330] way
[00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:32.470] to
[00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.710] do
[00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.950] it
[00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:33.330] is
[00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:33.530] a
[00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.710] little
[00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.990] more
[00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.590] convoluted,
[00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.750] but
[00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:35.010] only
[00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:35.190] a
[00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.290] little
[00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:35.550] more.
[00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:35.650] And
[00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:35.870] we'll
[00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:36.230] return
[00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.370] to
[00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:36.510] the
[00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.990] equivalence
[00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.250] later
[00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:37.630] on,
[00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:37.890] is
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.540] the
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:40.760] czar
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.040] prints
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.220] up
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.880] certificates,
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:44.140] drops
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:44.320] them
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:44.620] from
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.160] helicopters,
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.540] and
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.060] says,
[00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:49.070] to
[00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:49.410] emit
[00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:49.690] a
[00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:49.850] ton
[00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:50.010] of
[00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:50.630] CO2,
[00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:51.090] you
[00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:51.850] have
[00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:52.030] to
[00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.230] give
[00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.490] me
[00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:53.010] a
[00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:53.490] certificate.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:55.880] Limited
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.240] number
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:56.420] of
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:56.940] certificates
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:57.560] equal
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:57.760] to
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:57.960] the
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.180] total
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:58.520] amount
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:58.680] of
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.140] CO2
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:43:59.340] the
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:43:59.500] czar
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:43:59.820] wants
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.000] to
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:00.360] permit,
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.020] you
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.180] get
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:02.300] a
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:02.560] market.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:04.820] I
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:05.100] go
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:05.360] around
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:05.620] looking
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:05.840] for
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.280] certificates.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:06.580] I'm
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:06.820] willing
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.020] to
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:07.180] pay
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:07.540] $20
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:07.940] for
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:08.020] it.
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:08.200] I'm
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:08.320] willing
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:08.480] to
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:08.620] pay
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:08.900] some
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.300] price.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:10.420] The
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:10.660] market
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:10.820] will
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:11.140] determine
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:11.440] what
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:11.840] price.
[00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:12.830] In
[00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:13.050] this
[00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:13.350] case,
[00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:13.530] if
[00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:13.670] I
[00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.990] fix
[00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.150] a
[00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.550] price,
[00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:15.210] the
[00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:15.490] market
[00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:15.670] will
[00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.990] determine
[00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.210] the
[00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:16.590] quantity.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:17.960] If
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.100] I
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:18.360] fix
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:18.520] a
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:18.940] quantity,
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:19.200] the
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:19.440] market
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:19.620] will
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:19.960] determine
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:20.180] the
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:20.560] price.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:21.660] But
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:21.760] I
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:21.900] can
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:22.120] go
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:22.320] either
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:22.700] way.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.000] And
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:25.180] if
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:25.320] the
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:25.460] czar
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:25.760] knows
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.000] all,
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:26.140] it
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:26.400] doesn't
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:26.680] matter
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:26.920] which
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.100] way
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:27.240] he
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:27.520] goes.
[00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.250] We'll
[00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:29.530] talk
[00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:29.670] a
[00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.750] little
[00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:30.030] later,
[00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:30.430] I
[00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.870] think,
[00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:31.250] about
[00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:32.110] when
[00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:32.270] and
[00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.490] where
[00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:32.670] and
[00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.850] how
[00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:32.990] it
[00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.170] might
[00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.490] matter.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:36.220] That's
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:36.700] what
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:36.880] the
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.120] czar
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.380] might
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:38.600] want
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:38.740] to
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:39.040] do,
[00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:40.390] right?
[00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.510] Do
[00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.690] those
[00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:40.970] make
[00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:42.010] sort
[00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:42.110] of
[00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:42.350] top
[00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:42.430]-of

[00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.690]-head
[00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:43.090] sense
[00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.910] as
[00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:44.050] a
[00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:44.170] way
[00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:44.310] to
[00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:44.490] do
[00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:44.610] it
[00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:45.010] without
[00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.010] having
[00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.170] to
[00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:46.350] do
[00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:46.670] central
[00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:47.110] planning
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:49.920] for
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.080] all
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:50.240] the
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:50.520] nations
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:50.700] of
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:50.800] the
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.120] world?
[00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:52.990] But
[00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.130] if
[00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:53.250] you
[00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:53.670] say
[00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.990] it's
[00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.290] $30
[00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:54.810] a
[00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:54.970] ton
[00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:55.110] or
[00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:55.430] $40
[00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.910] a
[00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:56.210] ton
[00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.210] for
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:57.820] everybody,
[00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:59.230] and
[00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.170] poor
[00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.550] countries
[00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.790] have
[00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.930] to
[00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:01.190] pay
[00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.410] it,
[00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:02.310] how
[00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:02.510] do
[00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.690] they
[00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:02.910] do
[00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:03.210] that?
[00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:04.170] How
[00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:04.350] do
[00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:04.510] they
[00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.710] do
[00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:05.010] that?
[00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:07.150] So
[00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:08.250] you
[00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:08.650] know
[00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:08.830] that
[00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:08.990] they're
[00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.090] going
[00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:09.170] to
[00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.330] have
[00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:09.450] to
[00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:09.610] do
[00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:09.950] some
[00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:10.450] reduction.
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.160] Because
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:12.400] if
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:12.480] you
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:12.800] think
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.080] about
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:13.260] it,
[00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:17.090] they're
[00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:17.490] building
[00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:18.870] buildings,
[00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.550] facilities,
[00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:19.990] et
[00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.270] cetera.
[00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:20.910] It's
[00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:21.190] a
[00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.490] lot
[00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:21.950] cheaper
[00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:22.470] to
[00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.990] insulate
[00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.250] a
[00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:23.410] new
[00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:23.830] house
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.200] when
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:25.380] it's
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:25.560] being
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:25.900] built
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.120] than
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:26.220] to
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:26.340] go
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:26.840] back
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.520] and
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.380] retrofit
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:29.540] an
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:29.720] old
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.060] house.
[00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.410] It's
[00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:31.550] a
[00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.750] lot
[00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:32.030] cheaper
[00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.250] to
[00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:32.470] make
[00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.610] a
[00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:32.770] new
[00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:33.070] power
[00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:33.450] plant
[00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:33.950] efficient
[00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:34.370] than
[00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.590] to
[00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:35.190] repower
[00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.370] an
[00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:35.570] old
[00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:35.810] power
[00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:36.150] plant.
[00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.970] So
[00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:38.390] if
[00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.650] the
[00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.070] poorer
[00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:40.490] countries
[00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:40.650] of
[00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:40.770] the
[00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:40.930] world
[00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:41.110] are
[00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:41.450] growing
[00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:41.810] more
[00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:42.290] rapidly,
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:43.740] they
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:43.940] have
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:44.060] a
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:44.180] lot
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:44.520] more
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.620] relatively
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:46.340] inexpensive
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:46.940] investment
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.500] opportunities.
[00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:49.970] They
[00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:50.210] also
[00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.390] may
[00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.550] not
[00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.690] have
[00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.870] built
[00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:51.130] Los
[00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:51.470] Angeles
[00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.830] yet.
[00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.910] They're
[00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.970] in
[00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:54.050] a
[00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.350] position
[00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:54.610] to
[00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:55.010] decide
[00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.290] more
[00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:55.710] easily
[00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:55.950] on
[00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:56.090] a
[00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:56.330] different
[00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:56.610] urban
[00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.070] structure,
[00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.690] less
[00:45:58.690 --> 00:45:59.310] spread
[00:45:59.310 --> 00:45:59.490] out,
[00:45:59.570 --> 00:45:59.690] less
[00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:00.050] reliant
[00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.250] on
[00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:00.590] cars.
[00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:01.030] So
[00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.170] there
[00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:01.270] are
[00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.370] a
[00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:01.450] set
[00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:01.610] of
[00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:02.030] choices
[00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.830] that
[00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:02.950] are
[00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:03.290] being
[00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.730] made.
[00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.670] Also,
[00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:05.910] if
[00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.990] you
[00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.210] look
[00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:06.370] at
[00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:06.890] retrofit
[00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:07.350] options,
[00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:08.890] there's
[00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:09.050] a
[00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.330] lot
[00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:09.490] of
[00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:09.750] energy
[00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:10.110] use
[00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:10.750] now
[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:12.580] that
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.860] is
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.360] polluting
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:14.580] as
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:14.740] well
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:14.880] as
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.320] inefficient.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:18.240] So
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:18.820] modernizing
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:19.300] some
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:19.660] of
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:19.940] the
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:20.760] plants
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.380] now
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.620] will
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:22.920] create
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.080] a
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:23.300] double
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:23.780] benefit.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:25.900] If
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:25.980] you
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.120] can
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:26.300] do
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:26.700] something
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.120] besides
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:27.420] little
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.040] kerosene
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:28.600] generators,
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:28.900] for
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:29.180] instance,
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:29.420] for
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:29.960] electricity
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:30.180] in
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:30.280] a
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:30.400] lot
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:30.500] of
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:30.920] places,
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.480] you
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:31.640] will
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:31.920] not
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.220] only
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:32.920] save
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.240] energy,
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:33.480] but
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:33.580] you
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:33.880] clean
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:34.060] the
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:34.340] air.
[00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:35.270] So
[00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.470] there's
[00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:35.590] a
[00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:35.890] benefit
[00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:36.110] to
[00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:36.290] be
[00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.710] had
[00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:37.470] in
[00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:38.010] bringing
[00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.450] these
[00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:40.210] countries
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.020] closer
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:43.540] to
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:43.720] the
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.160] frontier
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.400] with
[00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.930] what
[00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:46.070] they
[00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:46.330] already
[00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:46.770] have.
[00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.790] So
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:52.980] this
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:53.140] is
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:53.280] a
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:53.520] hard
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:53.860] problem
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.100] for
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:54.260] the
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:54.520] czar.
[00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:56.850] The
[00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:57.110] czar
[00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:57.390] has
[00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.530] to
[00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.790] figure
[00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:58.230] out
[00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.070] how
[00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:00.130] she's
[00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:00.290] going
[00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.490] to,
[00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.790] or
[00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.950] the
[00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:01.290] czarina,
[00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.570] how
[00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:01.830] she's
[00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:01.950] going
[00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:02.070] to
[00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:02.230] deal
[00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.410] with
[00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:02.550] the

[00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:53.270] they'd
[00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.390] have

[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:57.860] So

[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:09.520] So
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.320] this
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:11.520] is
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:11.660] an
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.220] enormous
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:12.940] disparity.
[00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.740] Right?
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.160] North
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:15.640] America
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:15.900] is
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:16.220] running,
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:16.440] I
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:16.520] don't
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:16.740] know,
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:17.860] 16
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.240] metric
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:18.700] tons
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.160] per
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:19.540] capita.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:20.420] Africa
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:20.700] is
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.060] running
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:21.800] less
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:21.980] than
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.280] one.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:23.460] Big
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:23.900] disparity,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.240] huge
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:24.780] disparity.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.160] Very
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:25.500] different,
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:26.300] very
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:26.640] different
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:27.080] system.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:27.260] So
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:27.340] if
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:27.480] you're
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:27.500] going
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:27.600] to
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:28.000] change,
[00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.630] you're
[00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.690] going
[00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:29.790] to
[00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:29.930] look
[00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:30.230] people
[00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.410] in
[00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.530] the
[00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.850] face.
[00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:31.350] And
[00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:31.750] those
[00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.850] of
[00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:31.970] you
[00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:32.070] who
[00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:32.210] want
[00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:32.290] to
[00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:32.430] be
[00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.910] developing
[00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:33.490] countries
[00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:33.790] or
[00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:34.470] developed
[00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:35.090] countries
[00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:35.710] on
[00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:36.010] Wednesday
[00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:36.210] and
[00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:36.490] Friday,
[00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:36.670] you're
[00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.730] going
[00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:36.810] to
[00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:36.970] look
[00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:37.110] your
[00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:37.330] poor
[00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:37.610] brethren
[00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:37.870] in
[00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:37.990] the
[00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.250] face
[00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:38.450] and
[00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.730] say,
[00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:40.270] you,
[00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.590] Latin
[00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:41.010] America,
[00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:41.590] rest
[00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:41.770] of
[00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:42.050] Asia,
[00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.530] Africa,
[00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:43.530] boy,
[00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:43.730] you've
[00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.810] got
[00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:43.930] to
[00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:44.110] take
[00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:44.490] steps.
[00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:45.730] We'll
[00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:45.830] do
[00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:45.970] what
[00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:46.130] we
[00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.350] can,
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.140] but
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:48.380] you've
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:48.520] got
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:48.640] to
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:48.840] take
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:49.200] steps.
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:49.840] See,
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:50.080] we
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:50.440] have
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:50.720] path
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:51.200] dependence
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:51.440] up
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:51.620] here.
[00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:53.230] We're
[00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:53.430] kind
[00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.510] of
[00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.750] stuck
[00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.910] on
[00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:54.030] a
[00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.370] path,
[00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:54.590] and
[00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:55.490] what
[00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.550] are
[00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.570] you
[00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:55.650] going
[00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:55.730] to
[00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.890] do?
[00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:00.270] So
[00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.670] fairness
[00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.970] is
[00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:01.290] also
[00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:01.690] in,
[00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:03.070] one
[00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:03.610] response
[00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:03.890] might
[00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:04.110] be,
[00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.270] yeah,
[00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:04.390] well,
[00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.610] let's
[00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:05.530] look
[00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:05.710] not
[00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:06.030] per
[00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.470] capita,
[00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:07.690] but
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.480] you're
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:11.260] low
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:11.480] because
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:11.680] you're
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.020] really,
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:12.260] really
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:12.640] poor
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:12.800] and
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:12.940] we're
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:13.140] really,
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:13.360] really
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:13.640] sad
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:13.880] about
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.020] it.
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:14.140] But
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:14.380] per
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:14.680] dollar
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:14.920] of
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.300] GDP,
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:16.720] the
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:17.060] differences
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:17.300] are
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:17.540] less
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:17.940] stark.
[00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:20.110] The
[00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:20.350] winners
[00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:20.670] now
[00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.790] are
[00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.930] the
[00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:21.110] Middle
[00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:21.470] East,
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:23.660] Soviet
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.020] Union
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:24.220] and
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:24.480] Eastern
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:24.800] Europe
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.600] because
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.280] those
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:27.460] were
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:27.940] really
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.740] manufacturing
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:29.240]-intensive
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:29.780] technologies.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:30.760] They
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.100] ran
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:31.320] on
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:31.680] cheap
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.000] Russian
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:32.380] oil,
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.180] which
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:34.360] was
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:34.560] made
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.040] available
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:35.720] at
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.200] low
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:36.580] cost
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:36.780] and
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:37.080] Russian
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:37.480] natural
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:37.940] gas.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:38.520] They
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:38.760] still
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:38.960] have
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:39.080] an
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:39.440] enormous
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:39.840] amount
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:40.040] of
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:40.520] inefficient
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:41.000] capital
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:41.440] stock
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:41.820] running.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.480] And
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:44.840] China,
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:45.180] which
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:45.380] has
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:45.520] a
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.100] manufacturing
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:46.620]-intensive
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:47.120] economy
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:47.240] and
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:47.540] uses
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:47.760] a
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:47.880] lot
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.020] of
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:48.260] coal.
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:51.620] So
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:52.140] per
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:52.480] unit
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:52.680] of
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:53.140] GDP,
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:53.940] Africa's
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.240] right
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:54.380] in
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:54.540] there
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:54.720] with
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.020] everybody
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:55.400] else.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:56.500] They
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:56.660] just
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:56.900] happen
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:57.060] to
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:57.300] have
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:57.660] not
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:57.920] much
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.340] GDP
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:50:58.660] per
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.040] capita.
[00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:00.030] So
[00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.130] you
[00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:00.310] say,
[00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:00.650] well,
[00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:01.870] per
[00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:02.210] dollar
[00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:02.450] of
[00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.830] GDP,
[00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:03.230] we
[00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.370] can
[00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:03.570] make
[00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:03.790] cuts,
[00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:03.930] you
[00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:04.090] can
[00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:04.310] make
[00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:04.610] cuts.
[00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:06.770] And
[00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.970] one
[00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:07.410] response
[00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:07.670] might
[00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.970] be,
[00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:08.410] yeah,
[00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:08.690] but
[00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:09.250] we'd
[00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:09.390] like
[00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.610] our
[00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:09.810] GDP
[00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:10.130] to
[00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.470] grow.
[00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.750] Thank
[00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.870] you
[00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:11.090] very
[00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:11.450] much.
[00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:13.830] So
[00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:14.930] this
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:16.660] is
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:17.100] another
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.000] nice
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:18.480] example.
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:18.800] This
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:19.140] is,
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:19.420] if
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:19.580] you
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:19.800] do
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:20.020] the
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:20.580] cumulative,
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:20.980] you
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.220] do
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:21.640] what's
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:21.760] in
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:21.920] the
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.260] air,
[00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:24.390] which
[00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.650] was
[00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:24.810] the
[00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:24.990] point
[00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.350] Professor
[00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:25.810] Solomon
[00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:26.070] was
[00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:26.390] making.
[00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.590] If
[00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:26.670] you
[00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:26.830] do
[00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:27.190] what's
[00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.310] in
[00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:27.470] the
[00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.770] air,
[00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:28.230] this
[00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.370] is
[00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:28.570] just
[00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:28.990] CO2,
[00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:29.170] but
[00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:29.330] it
[00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:30.110] shows
[00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:31.190] cumulatively
[00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:32.230] what's
[00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.370] in
[00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:32.510] the
[00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.730] air
[00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:33.330] now
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000] based
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:35.220] on
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:35.400] a
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:35.800] model
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:36.040] of
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:36.220] the
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:36.480] carbon
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.000] cycle.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:37.920] What's
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:38.040] in
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:38.160] the
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:38.280] air
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:38.520] now
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:38.660] and
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:38.820] where
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:38.960] it
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:39.180] came
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:39.380] from?
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:39.720] Blue
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:39.960] is
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.120] the
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.300] rich
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:40.760] countries.
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:41.940] This
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:42.500] is
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:42.740] kind
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:42.860] of
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.160] middle
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:43.480]-income
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:43.980] developing
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.480] countries,
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.100] and
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:45.520] that's
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:45.700] the
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:45.980] very
[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:46.340] poor.
[00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:47.970] So
[00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:48.270] in
[00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.550] terms
[00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:48.950] of
[00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:49.870] who
[00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:50.430] caused
[00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.630] the
[00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:51.090] problem,
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:53.820] it's
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:54.280] not
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.400] who
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.000] put
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:56.160] the
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:56.380] stuff
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:56.520] in
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:56.620] the
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:56.840] air.
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:57.020] It's
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:57.220] not
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:57.560] China.
[00:51:58.290 --> 00:51:58.850] Who's
[00:51:58.850 --> 00:51:59.130] putting
[00:51:59.130 --> 00:51:59.270] it
[00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.430] in
[00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.530] the
[00:51:59.530 --> 00:51:59.750] air
[00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.870] and
[00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:00.050] who's
[00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:00.410] growing,
[00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:00.770] yeah.
[00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:01.510] But
[00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.650] who
[00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:01.970] put
[00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:02.090] it
[00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:02.370] there?
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:04.660] It's
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:04.920] us.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:06.460] OK.
[00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.910] A
[00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:13.150] little
[00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:13.450] bit
[00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:14.290] of

[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:21.940] And

[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:19.920] It's

[00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:30.150] countries
[00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.750] only.
[00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:32.410] And
[00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:32.510] by
[00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.570] the

[00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.750] rich

[00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.830] South
[00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:35.170] Korea
[00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:35.310] is

[00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.950] Singapore
[00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:38.250] is

[00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:41.090] is

[00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:42.710] So
[00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.850] it's
[00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:44.290] industrialized

[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:53.520] There
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:53.680] were
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.280] negotiated
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:54.760] reductions.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:55.980] The

[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:58.420] I
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:58.620] just
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:53:58.880] said
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:53:59.380] has
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:53:59.600] to
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.140] participate
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:00.540] if
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:01.000] something's
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:01.160] going
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:01.260] to
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:01.640] happen,
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:02.580] refused
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:03.040] to
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:03.340] even
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:03.980] promise
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:04.540] making
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.040] promises
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:05.320] in
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:05.440] the
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:05.760] future.
[00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:07.290] So
[00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:07.430] there
[00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.690] wasn't
[00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:07.890] even
[00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:08.090] a
[00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:08.550] commitment
[00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:09.590] to
[00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:09.790] make
[00:54:09.790 --> 00:54:09.930] a
[00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:10.270] commitment.
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:11.540] They
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:11.760] would
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:11.980] not
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:12.280] commit
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:12.460] to
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:12.760] commit.
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.300] And
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:14.440] if
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:14.520] you
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:14.680] think
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:14.860] about
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:15.080] that,
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:15.360] that's
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:15.700] really
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:16.200] resisting.
[00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:18.310] We'll
[00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:18.430] be
[00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.610] happy
[00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:18.790] to
[00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.910] come
[00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:19.010] to
[00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.170] these
[00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:19.470] meetings,
[00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:20.130] but
[00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:20.290] we
[00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:20.450] do
[00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.630] not
[00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.830] now
[00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:21.170] promise
[00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:21.610] ever
[00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:22.510] to
[00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.850] commit
[00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:23.010] to
[00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:23.170] do
[00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:23.550] anything,
[00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:24.230] unless,
[00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.410] of
[00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:24.590] course,
[00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.870] it's
[00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:25.110] paid
[00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:25.370] for.
[00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:26.170] So
[00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:27.430] the
[00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.710] Kyoto
[00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:28.150] Protocol
[00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.790] called

[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:32.460] It
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:32.740] was
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:33.460] ratified
[00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.150] by
[00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.450] the

[00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.670] other
[00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.990] folks.
[00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:44.230] We
[00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.390] did
[00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.750] not.
[00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:47.010] The
[00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:47.610] history
[00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:47.850] of

[00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.630] is
[00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:49.230] roughly
[00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.650] that
[00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:51.070] President
[00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:51.530] Clinton,
[00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.870] in

[00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.370]-up
[00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.530] to
[00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:52.750] those
[00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:53.430] negotiations,
[00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.710] had
[00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.870] a
[00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:55.170] lot
[00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:55.430] of
[00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:56.190] noise
[00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:57.430] in

[00:54:57.790 --> 00:54:58.070] about
[00:54:58.070 --> 00:54:58.350] how
[00:54:58.350 --> 00:54:58.550] this
[00:54:58.550 --> 00:54:58.670] will
[00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.830] be
[00:54:58.830 --> 00:54:59.150] free.
[00:54:59.230 --> 00:54:59.350] It'll
[00:54:59.350 --> 00:54:59.470] be
[00:54:59.470 --> 00:54:59.570] a
[00:54:59.570 --> 00:54:59.750] great
[00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:00.110] benefit
[00:55:00.110 --> 00:55:00.350] to

[00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:01.230] economy.
[00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:01.910] This
[00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:02.050] will
[00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:02.190] be
[00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.630] fabulous.
[00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.810] We
[00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:02.950] can
[00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:03.230] reduce
[00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.630] emissions.
[00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:03.850] It'll
[00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:03.990] be
[00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.190] no
[00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.610] cost.
[00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:05.430] Every
[00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.970] economist
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.200] not
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:07.520] working
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:07.700] for

[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.360] administration
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:08.760] stood
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:08.920] up
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.040] and
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:09.160] said,
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:09.320] well,
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:09.700] it's
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:09.860] not
[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:09.960] going
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.080] to
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.280] cost
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:10.500] that
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:10.700] much
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:10.920] money,
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.100] but
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:11.200] it
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:11.340] will
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:11.800] cost.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:14.460] Congress
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:14.980] passed
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:15.140] a

[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:16.440] to
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:16.720] nothing,
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.100] saying
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:17.280] we
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:17.500] won't
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:17.940] ratify
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:18.320] anything
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:18.600] that
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.500] basically,
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:20.140] slightly
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:20.400] different
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:20.780] language,
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:21.260] that
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:21.520] doesn't
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:21.840] require
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.040] the
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:22.320] Chinese
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:22.540] to
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:22.680] do
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:22.960] something
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.400] now,
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:24.420] 95
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:24.720] to
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:24.980] nothing.
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:26.320] So
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:26.900] Al
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:27.060] Gore
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:27.360] went
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:27.520] to
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:27.800] Kyoto.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:28.800] The
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.880] US
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.060] said,
[00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:31.290] this
[00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:31.450] is
[00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:31.850] fabulous.
[00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:32.910] We
[00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:33.150] made
[00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:33.290] an
[00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.610] agreement.
[00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:34.130] The
[00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.390] treaty
[00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.630] was
[00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.910] not
[00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:35.150] sent
[00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.310] to
[00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:35.510] the
[00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.790] Senate
[00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:36.630] for
[00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:37.310] ratification.
[00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:39.490] And
[00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:40.050] President
[00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:40.410] George
[00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:40.810] W.
[00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:41.150] Bush
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.660] formally
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:43.240] declared
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:43.420] the
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:43.640] horse
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:43.960] dead
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:44.820] in
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.460] 2001
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:45.880] when
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.020] he
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:46.280] said,
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:46.480] we're
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:46.660] not
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:46.800] going
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:46.900] to
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:47.160] play.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:48.720] So
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.380] the
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:49.720] EU
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:49.980] has
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.480] established,
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:50.800] and
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:51.080] again,
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:51.320] you
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:51.500] can
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:51.780] read
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:51.980] the
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:52.360] Parsons
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:52.540] et
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:52.700] al.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.080] article
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:53.620] if
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:54.040] you're
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:54.320] interested
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:54.580] in
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:54.900] it,
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:55.880] established
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.040] an
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:56.340] emissions
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:56.700] trading
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:57.020] scheme.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:57.280] They
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:57.760] did
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.060] these
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:58.580] certificates
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:55:59.360] drop
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:55:59.600] from
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:55:59.760] the
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.080] air
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:00.960] that
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.180] let
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:01.300] you
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:01.500] emit
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:01.820] carbon
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:02.260] dioxide.
[00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:03.270] I
[00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.450] mean,
[00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:03.710] it's
[00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.890] not
[00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:04.070] a
[00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:04.330] perfect
[00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:04.730] system.
[00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:04.970] You'll
[00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:05.130] see
[00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:05.370] some
[00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:05.850] glitches.
[00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.870] But
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:08.820] it
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:09.000] may
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:09.400] work,
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:09.980] and
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:10.140] they
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:10.320] may
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:10.620] actually
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:10.880] meet
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.060] their
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:11.400] commitments.
[00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:13.190] It
[00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.490] doesn't
[00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:13.790] appear
[00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:14.110] anybody
[00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:14.390] else
[00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.610] will,
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:16.000] even
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:16.300] those
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:16.560] that
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.080] ratified
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:17.300] the
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:17.560] treaty.
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:19.100] Australia
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:19.300] is
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:19.580] walking
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:20.100] away.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:20.600] I
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:20.760] think
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.120] Canada
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:21.360] has
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:21.640] walked
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.080] away.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:23.280] Japan
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.480] may,
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:24.980] because
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:25.340] of
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.140] the
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:26.540] incredible
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:27.100] disaster
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:27.400] they've
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:27.620] gone
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:27.960] through,
[00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:28.930] but
[00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:29.230] would
[00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:29.490] not
[00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:29.870] have
[00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.440] absented.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:34.120] And
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:34.280] may
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:34.620] not,
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:34.880] since
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:35.060] they
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:35.280] now
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:35.520] say
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:35.700] that
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:35.860] they
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:36.020] will
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:36.520] replace
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:36.900] the
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:37.160] nuclear
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:37.540] plants
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:37.720] with
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.060] coal.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.220] So
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:39.420] we'll
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:39.700] see.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:40.540] But
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:41.420] at
[00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:41.600] any
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:41.840] rate,
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:43.780] nothing
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.540] will
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:44.900] happen.
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:47.780] The
[00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:49.450] subsequent
[00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:50.150] agreements,
[00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:51.330] there
[00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:51.510] was
[00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:52.110] Copenhagen.
[00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.770] There
[00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:52.890] was
[00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:53.010] a
[00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:53.130] lot
[00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:53.270] of
[00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.550] fuss
[00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:53.890] around
[00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:54.430] Copenhagen.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:55.540] You'll
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:56.180] see
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:57.280] the
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:57.560] run
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:57.720]-up
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.420] discussed
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:58.660] in
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:58.800] the
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.280] Economist
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:56:59.540] reading.
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:56:59.940] You
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:00.140] will
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:00.420] see
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:00.600] the
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:00.840] most
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:01.360] recent,
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:02.420] Doha,
[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:03.160] discussed
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:03.380] in
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:03.540] the
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:03.820] second,
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:04.100] very
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:04.520] short
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.060] Economist
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:05.380] reading,
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:06.380] happened
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:06.820] in
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.260] December.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:09.980] There's
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:10.080] no
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.460] global
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:11.840] agreement
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:12.060] in
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:12.420] place.
[00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:14.430] What
[00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.750] happened
[00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.950] in
[00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:15.370] Doha,
[00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:16.250] and
[00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:17.330] it's
[00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:17.870] on
[00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:18.030] my
[00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:18.390] slides
[00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.870] for
[00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:19.510] Wednesday,
[00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.850] but
[00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:20.010] I'll
[00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:20.230] tell
[00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.350] you
[00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:20.530] now.
[00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:20.730] What
[00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:21.010] happened
[00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:21.210] in
[00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:21.610] Doha
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.100] was
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:23.680] basically
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:24.380] the
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:24.780] Europeans
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:25.140] agreed
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:25.340] to
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:25.720] continue.
[00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.990] There
[00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.510] was
[00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:29.050] a
[00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:29.390] promise
[00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.650] of
[00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:29.990] money
[00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.670] to
[00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.850] go
[00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:31.110] from
[00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:31.270] the
[00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.450] rich
[00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:31.810] countries
[00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:31.970] to
[00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:32.150] the
[00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.290] poor
[00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:32.710] countries,
[00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.910] a
[00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:33.110] much
[00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:33.530] smaller
[00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:34.010] promise
[00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.210] than
[00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:34.370] you
[00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:34.550] will
[00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:34.950] consider
[00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:35.870] Wednesday
[00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:36.070] and
[00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:36.370] Friday.
[00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.610] But
[00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:36.770] there
[00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.910] was
[00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:37.030] a
[00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.390] promise.
[00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:38.390] We'll
[00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.550] see
[00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:38.670] if
[00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:38.850] it's
[00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:39.090] kept.
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:41.860] And
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:43.060] the
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:43.600] developing
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.260] world
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.120] promised
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:45.400] to
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:45.860] consider
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:46.220] making
[00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:46.680] promises.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:48.380] That
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:48.580] is
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:48.760] to
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.040] say,
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:49.280] the
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:49.700] refusal
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:49.960] to
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.380] commit,
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:50.740] ever
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:50.980] to
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:51.320] commit,
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:51.820] is
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:52.020] off
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:52.180] the
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:52.480] table.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:53.080] They
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:53.320] now
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:53.560] say
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:53.780] they
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:54.020] will
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:54.560] consider,
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:55.500] in
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:55.900] subsequent
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:56.580] negotiations
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:56.980] beginning
[00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:57.240] in
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.120] 2015,
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.460] participating
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:00.160] in
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:00.580] a
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:01.100] global
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:01.800] regime
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:03.500] of
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:03.760] some
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:04.180] sort,
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:04.900] not
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:05.660] fully
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:05.980] spelled
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:06.320] out.
[00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:08.630] So
[00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:09.690] the
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:10.020] poor
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:10.380] countries,
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:10.600] as
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:10.740] I
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:10.940] say,
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.300] need
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:11.720] to
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:12.320] participate,
[00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:14.630] have
[00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:15.150] managed
[00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:15.350] to
[00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:15.530] be
[00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:16.030] excluded
[00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:16.390] so
[00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.730] far.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:20.360] The
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:20.680] task
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:20.800] you
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:20.960] will
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.300] face
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:21.660] on
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:21.900] Wednesday
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:22.060] and
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:22.360] Friday
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:22.780] is
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:24.120] to,
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:24.620] and
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:24.740] I
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:24.920] hope
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.100] do
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:25.200] it
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:25.340] with
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:25.500] a
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:25.720] straight
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:26.240] face,
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:28.180] is
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:28.340] to
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:28.540] make
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:29.020] proposals
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:29.280] that
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:29.460] have
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:29.880] some
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.260] hope
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:30.540] of
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:30.780] being
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:31.260] accepted
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:31.480] when
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:31.640] you
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:31.840] go
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.120] back
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:32.300] to
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:32.520] your
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.060] capitals
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:34.800] of
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.180] emissions
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:35.660] reductions
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:35.900] that
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:36.000] will
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:36.160] get
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:36.320] the
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:36.540] job
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:36.760] done
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.140] globally.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.340] OK,
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:38.660] I've
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:38.900] covered
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:39.120] a
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:39.460] lot.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:40.760] And
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.100] I'm
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:41.200] going
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:41.360] to
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:41.680] pause
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.080] here.
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:43.600] I
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:43.900] hate
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:44.040] to
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:44.180] quit
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:44.420] this
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:44.720] early.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:45.520] But
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:45.680] let
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:45.760] me
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:45.940] see
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:46.080] if
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:46.160] you
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:46.320] have
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:46.700] questions
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:46.940] or
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:47.320] comments.
[00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:48.730] How
[00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:48.950] do
[00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:49.150] we
[00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.350] do
[00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:49.730] this?
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:53.960] Have
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.080] you
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:54.280] all
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:54.480] read
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.460] the
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:55.700] briefing
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:56.140] materials?
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:56.600] No,
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:57.120] they're
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:57.280] up
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:57.500] for
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.200] Wednesday,
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:58:58.480] I
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:58.620] guess.
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:58:58.880] Yeah.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:10.620] 2
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:10.920] degrees
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:11.340] Celsius,
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:11.700] which
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:11.840] is
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.000] what
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:12.200] we're
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:12.520] working
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:12.780] with,
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:13.020] because
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:13.340] that's
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:13.480] how
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.360] the
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.420] exercise
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:15.840] was
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:16.300] set,
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:17.040] is
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:17.540] really
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:17.960] ambitious
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.260] at
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:18.460] this
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:18.820] stage.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:20.580] I
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:20.820] mean,
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:21.080] it
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:21.240] is
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:21.400] the
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.280] goal
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:22.460] that
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:22.620] was
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:23.000] adopted
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:23.260] in
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:23.800] Copenhagen.
[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:26.020] It's
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:26.180] a
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:26.440] very
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:26.780] ambitious
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:27.200] goal
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:27.480] at
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:27.720] this
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.140] stage.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:28.960] It
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.240] might
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:29.440] not
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:29.580] have
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:29.720] been
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:29.960] so
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.220] ambitious
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:30.580] 20
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:30.840] years
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:31.100] ago.
[00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:32.330] But
[00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:32.730] now,
[00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:33.450] more
[00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:33.790] stuff
[00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:33.930] in
[00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:34.050] the

[00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.950] Yeah,
[00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:38.150] I

[00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:50.870] It
[00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:51.330] is.
[00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:51.970] It
[00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:52.450] is.
[00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:53.430] But

[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:31.500] even
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:31.980] allows
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.180] for
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:32.320] the
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:32.860] possibility
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:33.080] of
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:33.180] an
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:33.540] enforcement
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:34.000] mechanism.
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:34.280] I'd
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:34.400] have
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:34.500] to
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:34.640] go
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:34.840] back
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:34.980] and
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:35.260] look.
[01:01:37.530 --> 01:01:38.170] For
[01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:38.970] simple
[01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:39.990] international
[01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.930] agreements,
[01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:41.570] it
[01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:41.930] hasn't
[01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:42.210] mattered
[01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:42.610] much,
[01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:43.550] the
[01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:43.930] Montreal
[01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:44.390] Protocol
[01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.790] to
[01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:45.110] phase
[01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:45.490] out
[01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:45.990] ozone
[01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.450]-depleting
[01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:47.030] substances.
[01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:48.310] Widely
[01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:49.050] ratified,
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.000] not
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:51.640] perfect.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:52.140] There's
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:52.280] some
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:52.600] illegal
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.360] manufacturing
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:53.900] here
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:54.040] and
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:54.360] there.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:55.140] But
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:55.660] basically,
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:56.460] it's
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.420] tiny.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:58.600] So
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.060] most
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:01:59.440] governments
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:01:59.700] can
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.000] afford
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:00.180] to
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:00.380] just
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:00.740] do
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:00.980] it.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:01.820] Most
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:02.140] countries
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:02.320] can
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:02.620] afford
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:02.780] to
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.080] do
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:03.320] it.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:04.900] Rich
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:05.280] countries
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:05.540] use
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:05.780] those
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.100] chemicals
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:06.380] more
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:06.540] than
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:06.780] poor
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:07.240] countries.
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:07.820] Rich
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.840] countries
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:10.080] can
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:10.300] afford
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.080] substitutes.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:11.960] Not
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.400] perfect,
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.360] but
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:13.780] cheap.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:14.980] This,
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:15.200] not
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:15.380] so
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:15.520] cheap.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:15.740] And
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:15.920] so
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.100] no
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:16.460] enforcement
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:16.920] mechanism
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.140] there
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:17.320] either,
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:17.480] as
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:17.620] far
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:17.740] as
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:17.900] I
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.080] know.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:18.500] I
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:18.860] don't
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:19.200] think
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:19.380] there
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:19.580] was.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.040] In
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.200] any
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:20.400] case,
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:20.540] it
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:20.700] was
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:21.880] never
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.340] seriously
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:22.880] deployed.
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:24.820] Here,
[01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:25.730] what
[01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:25.910] would
[01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:26.030] you
[01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.290] do?
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:27.520] I
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:27.800] mean,
[01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:29.310] the
[01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:29.830] Europeans
[01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:30.110] were
[01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:30.330] ready
[01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:30.510] to
[01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.690] go.
[01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:31.030] Everybody
[01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:31.310] was
[01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:31.510] very
[01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.870] excited.
[01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:32.170] Al
[01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:32.350] Gore
[01:02:32.350 --> 01:02:32.610] flew
[01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:32.790] to
[01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:33.070] Kyoto.
[01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:34.050] It
[01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:34.610] was
[01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:35.050] high
[01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:35.570] times.
[01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:36.130] And
[01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:36.330] to
[01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:36.810] say,
[01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:37.350] the
[01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:37.570] US
[01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:37.830] has
[01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:38.570] always
[01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:39.710] talked
[01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.990] about
[01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.570] monitoring.
[01:02:41.330 --> 01:02:41.650] No
[01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:41.810] matter
[01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:42.050] who
[01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:42.230] the
[01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.810] president's
[01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:43.070] been,
[01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:43.870] we
[01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:44.410] always
[01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:44.730] talk
[01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:45.010] about
[01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:45.630] monitoring
[01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:46.750] in
[01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:47.250] these
[01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:47.530] kinds
[01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:47.910] of
[01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:48.430] discussions.
[01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:49.610] Nobody
[01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:49.930] listens
[01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:50.150] to
[01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.410] us
[01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:51.010] much
[01:02:51.010 --> 01:02:51.270] now.
[01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:51.510] But
[01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:52.170] we
[01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:52.470] always
[01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.730] say,
[01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:52.890] gee,
[01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:53.050] you
[01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:53.230] ought
[01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.310] to
[01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:53.610] actually
[01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:53.870] know
[01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:54.010] if
[01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:55.070] somebody's
[01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:55.630] obeying
[01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.790] the
[01:02:55.790 --> 01:02:57.030] agreement.
[01:02:59.310 --> 01:02:59.950] That's
[01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:00.490] resisted
[01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:00.650] by
[01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.790] a
[01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:00.870] lot
[01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.970] of
[01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:01.350] countries.
[01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:04.050] So
[01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:04.510] no,
[01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:05.150] and
[01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.290] you
[01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:05.450] can
[01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.850] now
[01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:06.430] imagine
[01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:06.750] the
[01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.410] beginnings
[01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:08.090] of
[01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:08.230] a
[01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.550] European
[01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:09.190] reaction.
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:10.480] Wait
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:10.600] a
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:10.720] minute,
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.040] we're
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:11.360] doing
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:11.620] all
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:11.960] this.
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:12.940] And
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:13.300] what
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:13.420] are
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:13.580] all
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:13.700] these
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:13.880] other
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.100] people
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:14.420] doing?
[01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:15.630] They're
[01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:16.030] smiling
[01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:16.290] at
[01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:16.590] us.
[01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:17.790] They're
[01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:18.310] also,
[01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:19.750] it
[01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:20.150] raises
[01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.470] the
[01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.770] cost
[01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:20.930] of
[01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:21.090] our
[01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:21.330] heavy
[01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:21.830] industry,
[01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:22.510] our
[01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.830] energy
[01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:23.270]-intensive
[01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.710] industry.
[01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:25.490] And
[01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:26.250] wait
[01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:26.330] a
[01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:26.410] minute,
[01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.590] why
[01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:26.670] are
[01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.770] we
[01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:26.930] doing
[01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:27.170] this
[01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:27.710] again?
[01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:28.710] Because
[01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:29.070] it's
[01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:29.230] not
[01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.370] going
[01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:29.410] to
[01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:29.550] have
[01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:29.730] any
[01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:30.150] effect,
[01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:30.870] right?
[01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:31.110] I
[01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:31.290] mean,
[01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:31.670] Europe
[01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.830] is
[01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:31.950] a

[01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:33.590] relative
[01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:33.850] to
[01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:34.150] those
[01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.450] big
[01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:34.870] charts,
[01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:35.810] the

[01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:36.270] of
[01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:36.690] reductions

[01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.810] hard
[01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:39.030] to
[01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:39.390] see
[01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:40.950] on
[01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:41.590] the
[01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:42.010] aggregate.
[01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.270] If
[01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:42.370] I
[01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:42.490] go
[01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:42.790] back
[01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:42.990] to,
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:46.620] that's
[01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:46.740] the
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:46.860] one.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:47.000] If
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:47.080] I
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:47.220] go
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:47.480] back
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:47.620] to
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:47.880] this
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.140] one,
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.700] Europe
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:50.120] might
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:50.480] be
[01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:51.490] the
[01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:51.890] width
[01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:52.110] of
[01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:52.410] this
[01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:52.970] down
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.340] at
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:55.600] some
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.060] cost.
[01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:57.290] So
[01:03:57.290 --> 01:03:57.470] you
[01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.590] could
[01:03:57.590 --> 01:03:57.910] imagine
[01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:58.130] the
[01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.410] European
[01:03:58.410 --> 01:03:58.910] public
[01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:59.510] being
[01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.810] less
[01:03:59.810 --> 01:03:59.950] and
[01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:00.110] less
[01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:00.590] excited
[01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:01.810] just
[01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:01.970] as
[01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:02.190] they've
[01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.450] begun
[01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:02.650] to
[01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:02.930] phase
[01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:03.430] down
[01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:04.390] subsidies
[01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.730] for
[01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:05.070] renewable
[01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:05.490] energy.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:07.780] So
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.100] yeah,
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.780] that's
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:10.180] part
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:10.260] of
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:10.360] the
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:10.700] problem.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:11.860] The
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:12.160] czar
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:12.380] can
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:12.860] enforce.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:13.600] We
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:13.740] do
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:13.900] not
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:14.080] have
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:14.200] a
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:14.420] czar.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:15.440] We
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:15.600] do
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:15.780] not
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:15.940] have
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:16.060] a
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:16.640] czar.
[01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:24.070] Didn't
[01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:24.290] say
[01:04:24.290 --> 01:04:24.770] force.
[01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.970] You
[01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:27.250] can't
[01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:27.390] use
[01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.630] force
[01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.790] because
[01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:27.990] none
[01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.070] of
[01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:28.210] these
[01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:28.570] agreements,
[01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.870] that
[01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:30.310] unless
[01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:30.590] it
[01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:32.050] requires,
[01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:32.470] which
[01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.630] is
[01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.810] to
[01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:33.030] say
[01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:33.270] that
[01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.770] China
[01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:34.190] signs
[01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.430] on
[01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.570] to
[01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:34.890] something
[01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:35.110] that
[01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:35.350] says
[01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:35.470] it
[01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:35.630] will
[01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.850] do
[01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:36.150] x.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:41.900] Oh,
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.080] I
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:42.340] can't
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:42.700] imagine,
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.060] I
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:43.600] can't.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:44.400] And
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:44.820] this
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:45.120] country's
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:45.240] got
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:45.380] a

[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:46.520] history
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:46.840] of

[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:47.660] arms
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:48.140] reduction.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:48.940] Do
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:48.980] you
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:49.240] remember,
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:49.600] well,
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:49.720] you
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:49.920] wouldn't
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.320] remember,
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:50.500] but
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:50.600] you
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:50.700] may
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:50.840] have
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.340] heard
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.040] people
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:52.320] say,
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:52.700] trust
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:52.880] but
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.280] verify.
[01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.870] We've
[01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:55.210] always
[01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:55.450] had
[01:04:55.450 --> 01:04:55.650] that
[01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:55.970] view
[01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:56.710] internationally,
[01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:57.050] that
[01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:57.210] we
[01:04:57.210 --> 01:04:57.410] want
[01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.510] to
[01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.690] make
[01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:57.850] sure
[01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:57.990] if
[01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.250] we're
[01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.370] going
[01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:58.470] to
[01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.790] obey,
[01:04:58.930 --> 01:04:59.090] we're
[01:04:59.090 --> 01:04:59.170] going
[01:04:59.170 --> 01:04:59.250] to
[01:04:59.250 --> 01:04:59.430] make
[01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.610] sure
[01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:00.070] other
[01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:00.390] people
[01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.590] do
[01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:00.830] too,
[01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:01.030] at
[01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:01.170] least
[01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:01.750] monitor.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:02.620] You
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:02.800] may
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:02.920] not
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.060] be
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:03.180] able
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:03.320] to
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:03.680] enforce.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:04.180] So
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:04.560] I
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:04.860] can't
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.060] see
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:05.240] us
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:05.560] signing
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.080] something,
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.400] ratifying
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:07.800] something,
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.300] that
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:08.660] doesn't
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:08.940] have
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.100] at
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:09.280] least
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:09.960] monitoring
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.580] provisions.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:12.960] Enforcement,
[01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.690] look
[01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:16.870] at
[01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:17.650] attempts
[01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:17.890] to
[01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:18.130] take
[01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.430] action
[01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.730] against
[01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:19.070] Syria.
[01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.470] The
[01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.770] world
[01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:20.230] community
[01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.630] doesn't
[01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.950] lightly
[01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:21.510] enforce
[01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.950] stuff.
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:23.260] But
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:23.580] every
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:23.800] so
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:24.100] often,
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:24.580] Syria,
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.140] Iran,
[01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.390] something
[01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.670] gets
[01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:26.990] done.
[01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:27.450] But
[01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:27.550] it
[01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:27.730] doesn't
[01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:27.890] get
[01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:28.130] done
[01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:28.470] easily,
[01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:28.810] doesn't
[01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:28.970] get
[01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:29.170] done
[01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:29.690] automatically.
[01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:29.990] It's
[01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.130] a
[01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:30.310] big
[01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:30.690] political
[01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:31.070] deal.
[01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.350] David?
[01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:32.030] I
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:37.200] see
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:37.420] it
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:37.960] fills
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:56.160] up
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:56.240] the
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:56.640] infrastructure
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.040] because
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:02.520] you're
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:02.640] in
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:02.760] the
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.100] States
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:03.760] by
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.060] making
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:04.400] that
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:04.880] part
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.000] of
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:05.120] your
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:05.760] global
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.200] value
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:06.400] added.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:08.740] Well,
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:09.500] it
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.020] happens
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:10.200] to
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:10.420] some
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:10.860] extent.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:11.300] There's
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:11.440] a
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:11.840] problem
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.420] of
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.660] measurement.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:15.240] The
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:15.640] European
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.380] system,
[01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.530] the
[01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:18.830] Kyoto
[01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:20.450] Protocol
[01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:21.450] provides
[01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:22.030] for
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.580] joint
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.400] implementation.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:27.440] I
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.100] forget
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:28.520] the
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:28.800] exact
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.320] language,
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:29.880] the
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.020] Clean
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:30.400] Development
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:30.940] Mechanism,
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:31.540] CDM.
[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:32.400] You
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:32.620] can,
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:32.940] if
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:33.160] you're
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:33.320] a
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:33.680] European
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.100] company,
[01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:36.630] you
[01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.990] can
[01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.430] meet
[01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.990] some
[01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.230] of
[01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.410] your
[01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:39.050] obligations
[01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:41.330] by
[01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:41.850] reducing
[01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:42.330] emissions
[01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:42.610] in
[01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:42.730] a
[01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:42.890] poor
[01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:43.230] country.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:44.640] So
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:44.900] you
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:45.100] can
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:45.300] go
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:45.500] to
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:45.800] China
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.340] and
[01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:49.590] do
[01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:49.750] a
[01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.930] deal,
[01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:50.210] bring
[01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:50.370] in
[01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:50.530] new
[01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:51.110] technology,
[01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:51.370] do
[01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:51.770] something
[01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:52.290] that
[01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:52.430] will
[01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.770] reduce
[01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:53.270] emissions.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.180] And
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:55.380] that
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:55.480] will
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:55.680] give
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:55.800] you
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.060] credit.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:56.240] And
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:56.480] that's
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.500] exactly
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:57.760] that
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:57.960] kind
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.080] of
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:58.340] thinking.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.060] Can
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:06:59.360] we,
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:00.220] even
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:00.480] though
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:00.820] China
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:01.260] isn't
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:01.980] participating,
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.120] it's
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:03.360] still
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:03.700] cheaper
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:03.880] to
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.020] do
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:04.460] reductions
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:04.840] there.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:05.600] So
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.240] let's
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:06.540] find
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:06.700] a
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:06.900] way
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:07.140] to
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:07.540] give
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.420] countries
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:08.660] in
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:08.860] Europe
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:09.240] credit
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:09.460] for
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:09.860] reductions
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:10.140] in
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:10.420] China.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.280] There
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:12.400] are
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:12.560] a
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:12.720] couple
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:12.880] of
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.320] problems.
[01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:17.250] Well,
[01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:17.810] it
[01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:17.990] all
[01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.250] boils
[01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:18.470] down
[01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.570] to
[01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:18.710] one
[01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:19.030] problem,
[01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:19.810] really,
[01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:20.110] which
[01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:20.350] is,
[01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:21.290] how
[01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:21.410] do
[01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:21.530] you
[01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:21.790] measure
[01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:22.250] it?
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:23.180] Because
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.720] you're
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.080] reducing
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:25.400] over
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:25.680] what
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:25.960] would
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.160] have
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:26.480] been.
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:27.480] So
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:27.640] you
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.100] modernize
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:28.240] a
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:28.580] factory.
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:30.140] So
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:30.320] would
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:30.540] that
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:30.900] factory
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:31.100] have
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.240] been
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:31.480] running
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:31.920] forever
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.160] with
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:32.380] old
[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:32.900] technology?
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:33.580] Or
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:33.760] would
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:33.860] it
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:33.980] have
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.160] been
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:34.400] torn
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:34.820] down?
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:35.000] Or
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:35.180] would
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:35.260] it
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:35.360] have
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:35.500] been
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.080] modernized
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:36.460] anyway?
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:37.780] So
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.400] either
[01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:40.370] you're
[01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.550] real
[01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:41.030] light
[01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:41.470] on
[01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.670] how
[01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.830] you
[01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:41.990] do
[01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.350] this.
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:44.080] And
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:44.540] you
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:44.840] don't
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:45.220] impose
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:45.500] real
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:45.720] tough
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:46.180] restrictions.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:46.900] And
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.060] then
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:47.180] you're
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:47.320] not
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:47.500] getting
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:47.740] real
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:48.180] reductions.
[01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.470] Or
[01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.630] you
[01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:50.170] make
[01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:50.310] it
[01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:50.730] really
[01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:51.090] hard
[01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:51.270] to
[01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:51.670] document,
[01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:51.990] in
[01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.150] which
[01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.390] case
[01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.510] you
[01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.690] kill
[01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:52.830] the
[01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:53.090] market.
[01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.970] So
[01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:54.550] it
[01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:55.090] happens.
[01:07:55.110 --> 01:07:55.250] And
[01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.390] it
[01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:55.710] happens
[01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:55.910] to
[01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:56.190] some
[01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.470] extent.
[01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:56.690] The
[01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:57.090] Europeans
[01:07:57.090 --> 01:07:57.230] have
[01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.370] gotten
[01:07:57.370 --> 01:07:57.510] a
[01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.550] little
[01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:57.990] tired
[01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.210] of
[01:07:58.210 --> 01:07:58.310] it,
[01:07:58.330 --> 01:07:58.430] as
[01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.610] I
[01:07:58.610 --> 01:07:58.950] recall,
[01:07:59.370 --> 01:07:59.650] thinking
[01:07:59.650 --> 01:07:59.890] that
[01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:00.050] it's
[01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:00.190] been
[01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.310] a
[01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:00.410] little
[01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.650] too
[01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:00.990] easy.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:02.010] But
[01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:03.670] one
[01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:04.430] of
[01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.610] the
[01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:04.970] features
[01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:05.250] of
[01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:05.510] the
[01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:06.150] Waxman
[01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.550]-Markey
[01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:06.790] Bill
[01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:06.950] in
[01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:07.110] the
[01:08:07.110 --> 01:08:07.570] US,
[01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:09.210] which
[01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:09.450] was
[01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:09.670] the
[01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.910] cap
[01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:10.050]-and
[01:08:10.050 --> 01:08:10.270]-trade
[01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:10.490] bill
[01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:10.650] that
[01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:10.910] was
[01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:11.650] killed,
[01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:12.430] it
[01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.790] allowed
[01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:13.110] for
[01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:13.530] that
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.780] for
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.280] it
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:16.940] covered
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:17.280] only
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:17.660] fossil
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:18.180] fuels.
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:19.320] But
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:19.780] it
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:20.500] allowed
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.140] companies
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:21.380] to
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:21.560] get
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.120] credit
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.080] for
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:23.720] things
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.000] done
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:24.200] in
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:24.760] agriculture.
[01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:26.220] So
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:26.400] you
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:26.540] could
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:26.880] change
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.200] land
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:27.520] use.
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:28.960] And
[01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:31.590] it
[01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.890] was
[01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:32.530] a
[01:08:32.530 --> 01:08:32.790] giveaway
[01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:33.070] to
[01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.570] agriculture,
[01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:34.090] basically,
[01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:34.410] because
[01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:34.690] the
[01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:35.050] standards
[01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:35.250] were
[01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:35.390] going
[01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.470] to
[01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.650] be
[01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:35.910] pretty
[01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:36.310] easy.
[01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.850] But
[01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:36.930] it
[01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:37.070] was
[01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.230] that
[01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:37.570] same
[01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:37.930] notion
[01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:38.190] that
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:39.200] I
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:39.380] want
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:39.520] to
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:39.740] reach
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:39.980] out
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:40.620] beyond
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.540] places
[01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:41.800] that
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:41.920] I
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.080] can
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:42.560] price
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.100] to
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:43.320] give
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:43.680] people
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:44.160] incentives.
[01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.870] But
[01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:46.070] it's
[01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.310] really
[01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:46.650] hard,
[01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:46.930] because
[01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:47.270] you
[01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:47.430] can
[01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.730] measure
[01:08:47.730 --> 01:08:47.970] what
[01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:48.450] is
[01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:48.790] emitted.
[01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:49.590] You
[01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.770] can
[01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:49.990] never
[01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.350] measure
[01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:50.590] what
[01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.910] would
[01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:51.130] have
[01:08:51.130 --> 01:08:51.430] been.
[01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:54.270] You
[01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:54.410] could
[01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.630] see
[01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.830] the
[01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:55.050] same
[01:08:55.050 --> 01:08:55.390] problem
[01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:55.690] with
[01:08:55.690 --> 01:08:56.310] forests,
[01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:57.050] if
[01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.150] you
[01:08:57.150 --> 01:08:57.350] think
[01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:57.510] for
[01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.770] just
[01:08:57.770 --> 01:08:57.930] a
[01:08:57.930 --> 01:08:58.070] minute.
[01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.930] If
[01:08:58.930 --> 01:08:59.070] I
[01:08:59.070 --> 01:08:59.310] pay
[01:08:59.310 --> 01:08:59.450] you
[01:08:59.450 --> 01:08:59.670] not
[01:08:59.670 --> 01:08:59.830] to
[01:08:59.830 --> 01:08:59.990] cut
[01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.210] down
[01:09:00.210 --> 01:09:00.350] a
[01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:00.650] forest,
[01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:00.890] does
[01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:01.050] that
[01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:01.230] mean
[01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:01.390] the
[01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.570] guy
[01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:01.910] across
[01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:02.090] the
[01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:02.270] street
[01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:02.550] cuts
[01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.770] his
[01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:02.990] down
[01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.150] to
[01:09:03.150 --> 01:09:03.410] provide
[01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.590] the
[01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.790] timber?
[01:09:05.610 --> 01:09:06.090] Or
[01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:06.570] what?
[01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.490] And
[01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.590] you
[01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.750] would
[01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:08.030] never
[01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.210] have
[01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:08.390] cut
[01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.510] it
[01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.850] down?
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:10.620] Or
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:10.780] you
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:10.980] would
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:11.100] have?
[01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:13.020] So
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:13.500] it's
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:13.640] a
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.680] natural
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.040] model.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:15.240] If
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:15.640] everybody
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.120] was,
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:16.440] if
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:16.560] there
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:16.680] were
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:16.840] a
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:17.180] common
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:17.780] regime,
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.020] a
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:18.220] cap
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:18.340]-and
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:18.560]-trade
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:18.660] or
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:18.800] a
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.020] tax
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:19.400] regime,
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:20.100] that
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:20.260] would
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:20.620] happen
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.360] automatically,
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:21.940] easily.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:22.720] And
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:22.860] you
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:23.020] wouldn't
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:23.180] have
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:23.300] a
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:23.540] measurement
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:23.940] problem.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:24.740] It's
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:24.880] just
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.120] hard
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:25.260] to
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:25.400] do
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:25.520] it
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:25.920] without
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:26.280] such
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:26.400] a
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:26.540] thing.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.420] US
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:27.820] companies,
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.180] there's
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:28.720] some
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:28.940] sort
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:29.040] of
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:29.660] informal
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:30.200] trading
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:30.460] in
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:30.740] carbon
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.260] credits
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:31.440] in
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:31.540] the
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:31.940] US.
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:32.960] And
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.460] companies
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:33.680] will
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:33.900] do
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:34.160] stuff
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:34.380] like
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:34.780] this
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:35.740] and
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:36.480] take
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:36.760] credit
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:37.020] for
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:37.200] it.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:37.860] Perfectly
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:38.080] fine
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:38.520] activities.
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:40.740] It's
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:41.260] socially
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:41.860] responsible
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:42.100] and
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:42.240] all
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:42.420] that.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:42.560] But
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:42.700] it's
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:42.860] just
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:43.120] hard
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:43.280] to
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:43.700] assess.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.100] Well,
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:00.620] what
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:00.940] they're
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:01.240] worried
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:01.600] about
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.040] is,
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.220] you
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:03.440] guys
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:03.640] got
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:03.860] rich.
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:04.000] We
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:04.180] want
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:04.240] to

[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:40.940] something
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:41.500] that

[01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.270] out
[01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.410] there
[01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:02.530] on
[01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:02.870] television.
[01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:03.810] Just
[01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:04.890] a
[01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:05.030] few
[01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.210] weeks
[01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:05.410] ago,
[01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.590] the
[01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.770] State
[01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:06.190] Department
[01:12:06.190 --> 01:12:06.630] announced
[01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:07.010] that
[01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.570] we
[01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:07.830] would
[01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:08.250] be
[01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:08.670] part
[01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:08.830] of,
[01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.930] and
[01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:09.050] I
[01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:09.190] guess
[01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:09.390] the
[01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:09.650] leader
[01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:10.130] of,
[01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:10.470] an
[01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.790] effort
[01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:11.590] to
[01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:12.090] try
[01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:12.370] to
[01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:12.790] reduce
[01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:13.190] emissions
[01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:13.510] of
[01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.830] soot
[01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.610] and
[01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:14.910] other
[01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:15.270] short
[01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.410]-lived
[01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.890] gases,
[01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:17.250] stuff
[01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:17.450] like
[01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.970] methane
[01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:18.590] and
[01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:19.550] tropospheric
[01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:20.270] ozones
[01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:21.090] as
[01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:21.350] well.
[01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.710] So
[01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:22.950] that's
[01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:23.070] a
[01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.430] voluntary
[01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:24.070] program,
[01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:25.470] but
[01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:26.030] there
[01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.250] are
[01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:26.650] movements
[01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:26.950] in
[01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:27.130] that
[01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:27.530] direction.
[01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:27.770] And
[01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.910] there
[01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:28.050] is
[01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:28.550] actually
[01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:29.450] quite
[01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:29.650] a
[01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:29.790] bit
[01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.910] of
[01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:30.470] investment
[01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:31.350] in
[01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:33.470] providing
[01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:35.590] very
[01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:36.010] much
[01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:36.250] more
[01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:36.790] efficient
[01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:37.690] stoves
[01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:38.170] to
[01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:38.610] people
[01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:38.830] in
[01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:39.030] very
[01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.510] poor
[01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:40.970] countries
[01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:42.090] so
[01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:42.250] that
[01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:42.390] they
[01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.670] can
[01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:43.210] avoid
[01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:44.310] using
[01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.970] things
[01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:45.270] like
[01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.970] dung
[01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:46.550] and
[01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:47.010] coal
[01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:47.350] and
[01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.570] stuff
[01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.790] like
[01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:48.010] that,
[01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:48.190] which
[01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:48.630] generates
[01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.850] an
[01:12:48.850 --> 01:12:49.150] enormous
[01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:49.490] amount
[01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:49.610] of
[01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:49.930] pollution.
[01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:50.190] So
[01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:50.310] it
[01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.450] has
[01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.650] both
[01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:50.770] a
[01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:50.990] health
[01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.510] benefit
[01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.990] and
[01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.770] an
[01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:53.270] efficiency
[01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.750] benefit.
[01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.990] And
[01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.110] it
[01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.530] also
[01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.950] cuts
[01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:55.370] carbon
[01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:55.750] a
[01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.950] little
[01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:56.210] bit,
[01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:56.510] but
[01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:57.290] realistically,
[01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.670] the
[01:12:57.670 --> 01:12:57.910] main
[01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:58.450] motivation
[01:12:58.450 --> 01:12:58.790] is
[01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:59.050] much
[01:12:59.050 --> 01:12:59.310] more
[01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.670] grounded
[01:12:59.670 --> 01:12:59.990] in
[01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.250] soot.
[01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:01.550] I
[01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.770] mean,
[01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.250] one
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:04.620] reason,
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:04.780] not
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:04.900] the
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:05.060] main
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:05.300] reason
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:05.800] necessarily,
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.000] to
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:06.180] be
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:06.580] concerned
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:06.840] with
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.120] black
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:07.420] carbon
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:07.840] emissions
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.220] is
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:08.400] the
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:08.780] effect
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:09.280] on
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:09.460] the
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:09.740] reflection.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:11.240] You
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:11.360] have
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:11.460] a
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:11.560] lot
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:11.700] of
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:11.880] sea
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:12.140] ice.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:12.400] Ice
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:12.660] tends
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:12.820] to
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:13.220] reflect.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:14.280] Black
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:14.600] carbon
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:14.920] tends
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.080] to
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:15.460] absorb.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:16.120] So
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:16.420] it
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:16.660] does
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:17.060] matter
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:17.740] for
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:18.060] climate,
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:18.240] but
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:18.320] it
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:18.520] also
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:18.860] matters
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:19.020] for
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:19.140] what
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:19.240] you
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:19.480] breathe.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:23.360] There
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:23.520] are
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:23.900] lots
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.060] of
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:24.580] international
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:25.200] environmental
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:25.800] treaties.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:26.140] Most
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:26.340] don't
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:26.500] have
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:26.740] anything
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:26.880] to
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:26.980] do
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:27.120] with
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:27.420] climate.
