[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.220] Well,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.380] I
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:11.500] want
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.580] to
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.800] welcome
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.020] you.
[00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.230] This
[00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.350] is
[00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.470] going
[00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.510] to
[00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:13.610] be
[00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.810] really
[00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.090] cool.
[00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.310] This
[00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.390] is
[00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.490] going
[00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.510] to
[00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.710] be
[00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.750] really
[00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.090] fun.
[00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.950] And
[00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.770] I
[00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.870] think
[00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.030] you're
[00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.170] really
[00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.310] going
[00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.370] to
[00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.570] enjoy
[00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.950] yourselves.
[00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.330] This
[00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.970] course
[00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.290] is
[00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.870] about
[00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.610] creating
[00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.710] breakthroughs.
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.380] Now,
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.620] what
[00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.650] you'll
[00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.970] see
[00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.510] is
[00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.970] that
[00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.510] methods
[00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.290] for
[00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.310] sort
[00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.410] of
[00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.690] doing
[00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.410] incremental
[00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.090] innovations
[00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.030] are
[00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.490] reasonably
[00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.030] well
[00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.570] in
[00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.970] shape.
[00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.470] But
[00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.150] methods
[00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.410] to
[00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.730] do
[00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.850] breakthroughs
[00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.490] are
[00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.730] really
[00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.110] not.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.440] And
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.720] so
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.280] what
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.480] we
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.940] have
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.900] for
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.280] you
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.900] is
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.120] really
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.320] the
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.600] leading
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.880] edge
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.340] ways
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.120] to
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.520] identify
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.300] breakthroughs.
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.720] And
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.480] now,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.900] why
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.080] would
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.200] you
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.500] care?
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.280] Well,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.420] basically,
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.260] it
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.600] turns
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.980] out
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.680] that
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.120] once
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.420] you
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.980] have,
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.560] as
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.760] a
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.100] manager,
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.300] once
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.480] you
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.660] have
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.040] managed
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.240] to
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.400] take
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.680] all
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.840] the
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.160] cost
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.400] out,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.400] once
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.580] you
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.780] have
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.500] managed
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.840] to
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.000] be
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.120] as
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.480] efficient
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.700] as
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.840] you
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.220] can,
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.080] then
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.440] really,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.760] to
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.200] grow,
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.620] you
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.820] need
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.140] major
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.660] innovations.
[00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.310] You
[00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.850] can't
[00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.410] continue
[00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.610] to
[00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.810] do
[00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.050] all
[00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.250] these
[00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.650] minor
[00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.090] things.
[00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.530] What
[00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.970] happens
[00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.310] is,
[00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.730] as
[00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.910] you'll
[00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.090] see,
[00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.850] things
[00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.190] become
[00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.730] commodities.
[00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.070] Now,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.620] firms
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.780] are
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.980] not
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.360] stupid,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.620] and
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.760] they
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.180] realize
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.600] this.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.800] And
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.160] so
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.740] what
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.000] the
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.600] manager
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.960] or
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.100] the
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.420] CEO
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.840] often
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.180] does
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.380] is
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.540] he
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.820] says
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.080] something
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.420] like,
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.440] we
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.180] must
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.980] have
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.160] new
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.580] products.
[00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.320] We
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.580] must
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.800] have
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.180] major
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.420] new
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.860] products.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.740] He
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.880] says,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.140] yeah.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.240] And
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.340] so
[00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.480] then
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.620] what
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.720] they
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.920] do
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.060] is
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.320] they
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.780] continue
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.020] to
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.320] produce
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.760] incremental
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.080] ones,
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.280] because
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.540] nobody
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.840] knows
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.980] how
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.080] to
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.240] make
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.520] major
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.820] ones.
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.140] Then
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.300] the
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.640] manager
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.900] is
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.120] even
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.540] fiercer.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.740] He
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.040] says
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.340] something
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.780] like,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.420] we
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.720] must
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.040] have
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.620] one
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.100] third
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.360] of
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.540] our
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.020] products
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.400] brand
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.700] new
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.000] within
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.360] five
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.760] years.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.100] And
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.240] so
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.500] then
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.800] everybody
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.060] gets
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.220] into
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.400] this
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.740] mad
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.200] exercise
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.660] where
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.840] they
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.340] change
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.540] the
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.300] SKUs
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.420] on
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.540] their
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.960] existing
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.500] products.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.260] They
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.820] say,
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.480] well,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.180] let's
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.400] see.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.620] What
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.740] is
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.880] your
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.300] definition
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.540] of
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.800] really
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.080] new,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.560] boss?
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.340] Well,
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.480] a
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.600] new
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.900] SK,
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.260] ah,

[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.540] logistics,
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.080] how
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.240] it
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.400] should
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.760] work,
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.300] and
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.980] what
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.140] the
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.500] paper
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.680] is
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.980] like,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.100] and

[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.660] know
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.920] before
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.120] you
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.500] decide
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.700] whether
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.800] you
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.980] want

[00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.110] in
[00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.450] my
[00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.610] own
[00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.970] company.
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.020] Now,
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.420] my
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.860] research
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.320] focus
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.760] is
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.960] the
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.200] fuzzy
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.480] front
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.780] end.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.260] It
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.500] is
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.100] a
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.280] funny
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.620] term,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.780] isn't
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.940] it?
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.300] But
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.500] that's
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.640] what
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.800] they
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.040] use.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.160] It's
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.280] the
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.580] end
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.700] of
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.800] the
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.140] innovation
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.640] process
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.840] that
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.040] nobody
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.260] knows
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.360] how
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.440] to
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.520] do
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.660] anything
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.980] about,
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.720] which
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.060] is
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.040] where
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.280] does
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.440] the
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.740] idea
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.920] for
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.040] the
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.380] breakthrough
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.780] come
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.320] from
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.420] in
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.500] the
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.680] first
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.020] place?
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.980] That's
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.420] what
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.540] I
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:18.880] study.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.720] And
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.200] I
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.340] should
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.580] say
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.720] that
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.920] the
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.240] reason
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.420] I
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.680] began
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.880] to
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.180] study
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.620] that
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.520] was
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.720] rooted
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.940] in
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.080] an
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.540] experience
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.720] in
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.880] my
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.220] own
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.920] firm
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.220] way
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.400] back
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.740] when,
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.480] which
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.840] was
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.400] we
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.800] made
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.100] fax
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.460] machines.
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.860] And
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.280] it
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.600] was
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.760] my
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.040] first
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.400] job.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.980] I
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.160] was
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.000] 26.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.680] And
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.720] we
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.900] started
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.080] this
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.440] company.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.960] And
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.940] again,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.080] it
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.140] was
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.260] a
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.500] stock
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.800] market
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.080] boom
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.340] back
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.560] then.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.700] So
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.840] all
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.920] of
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.000] a
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.060] sudden,
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.220] we
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.320] were
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.640] 400
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.060] people.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.960] And
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.040] we
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.160] were
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.540] designing
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.760] this
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.100] stuff.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.800] And
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.120] I
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.280] was
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.480] always
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.880] designing
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.240] myself
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.440] into
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.840] corners.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.020] I
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.120] was
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.320] running
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.460] the
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.600] R
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.740]&D.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.500] I
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.780] would
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.960] sort
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.080] of
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.780] lay
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.920] it
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.040] out
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.260] like
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.540] this.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.640] And
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.720] it
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.820] was
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.940] going
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.980] to
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.100] be
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.360] so
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.700] great.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.540] And
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.860] then
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.240] we
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.520] ended
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.720] up
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.860] with
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.040] this
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.240] little
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.480] thing
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.580] in
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.720] the
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.020] corner
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.300] where
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.440] we
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.600] had
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.940] space
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.120] for
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.360] something
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.720] crucial
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.980] I'd
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.260] forgotten
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.620] about.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.800] And
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.840] it
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.920] was,
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.040] oh
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.180] my
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.500] god.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.360] So
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.620] that
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.080] amounted
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.220] to
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.740] saying
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.980] that
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.340] I,
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.560] as
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.800] a
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.180] buyer
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.420] of
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.840] something,
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.780] wanted
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.240] something
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.720] special.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.480] And
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.640] my
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.220] experience
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.580] generally
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.240] was
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.320] that
[00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.750] I
[00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.870] would
[00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.030] go
[00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.150] to
[00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.350] these
[00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.810] companies
[00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.790] who
[00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.930] were
[00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.130] supposed
[00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.330] to
[00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.690] supply
[00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.990] this
[00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.370] stuff.
[00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.090] And
[00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.190] they
[00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.290] were
[00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.590] not
[00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.990] helpful.
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.580] Now,
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.680] the
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.080] conventional
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.460] wisdom,
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.640] as
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.760] you
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.960] know,
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.160] is
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.380] sort
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.480] of
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.180] find
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.360] a
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.600] need
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.740] and
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.020] fill
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.200] it.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.280] Marketing
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.680] research
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.960] comes
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.280] along.
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.400] And
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.500] they
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.120] look
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.400] deep
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.560] into
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.800] your
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.100] eyes.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.220] And
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.340] they
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.540] say,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.940] ah,
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.960] I
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.100] know
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.260] what
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.380] you
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.660] need.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.600] Well,
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.760] that
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.000] wasn't
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.200] my
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.800] experience.
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.400] Far
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.660] from
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.060] that,
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.360] I
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.560] remember
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.840] once
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.960] we
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.100] had
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.200] to
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.340] make
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.420] a
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.580] little
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.080] fan.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.880] And
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.960] it
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.080] had
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.220] to
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.420] be
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.640] sort
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.740] of
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.880] a
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.080] higher
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.380] power
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.740] fan
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.000] than
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.880] these
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.160] companies
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.380] could
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.680] make.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.640] So
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.780] I
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.940] went
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.040] to
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.260] this
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.640] firm.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.000] And
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.140] I
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.280] said,
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.460] well,
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.620] we
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.840] need
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.120] a
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.420] fan
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.620] like
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.080] that
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.560] with
[00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.190] certain
[00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.630] pressure
[00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.770] and
[00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.890] so
[00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.990] on.
[00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.170] And
[00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.250] they
[00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.390] said,
[00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.530] well,
[00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.650] it
[00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.810] can't
[00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.930] be
[00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.170] done,
[00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.410] my
[00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.670] son.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.080] And
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.200] I
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.380] said,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.640] well,
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.200] but
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.340] I
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.580] need
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.860] it,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.540] being
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.660] in
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.780] a
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.020] jam.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.600] And
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.780] they
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.100] said,
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.780] yeah,
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.920] but
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.060] it's
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.340] against
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.580] the
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.760] laws
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.940] of
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.280] nature.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.780] Oh.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.880] So
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.020] we
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.180] went
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.360] off
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.500] to
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.800] Princeton,
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.000] where
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.100] they
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.260] don't
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.440] know
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.640] about
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.800] the
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.960] laws
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.100] of
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.320] nature,
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.540] and
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.740] then
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.100] asked
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.580] them,
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.800] an
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.500] aerodynamicist
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.740] down
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.920] there,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.060] to
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.360] design
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.520] us
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.680] the
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.880] fan,
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.080] which
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.260] they
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.520] did.
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.900] So
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.020] we
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.200] brought
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.380] the
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.580] fan
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.760] back
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.880] to
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.040] this
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.400] company
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.080] and
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.280] said,
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.560] OK,
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.800] will
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.960] you
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.600] manufacture
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.960] this
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.240] lovely
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.560] fan?
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.780] They
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.920] said,
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.040] well,
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.180] we
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.420] told
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.500] you
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.580] it
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.740] wouldn't
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.100] work.
[00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.050] So
[00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.450] of
[00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.590] course,
[00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.730] they
[00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.970] tested
[00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:23.130] it,
[00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.170] and
[00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.290] it
[00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.450] did.
[00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.630] But
[00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.810] never
[00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.970] mind,
[00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.190] leaving
[00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.330] that
[00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.590] aside.
[00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.830] If
[00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.990] we
[00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.230] make
[00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.350] it
[00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.530] for
[00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.710] you,
[00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.870] you
[00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.130] have
[00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.290] to
[00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.490] buy
[00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.690] them
[00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.090] $10
[00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.430],000
[00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.590] at
[00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.670] a
[00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.950] whack,
[00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.430] and
[00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.010] you
[00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.170] have
[00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.290] to
[00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.490] pay
[00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.650] for
[00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.790] the
[00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.010] tooling.
[00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.410] So
[00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.650] fine,
[00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.070] we
[00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.210] did
[00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.390] that.
[00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:36.190] They
[00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.510] started
[00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.930] sending
[00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.110] us
[00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.250] the
[00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.490] fans.
[00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.650] And
[00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.770] then
[00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.870] we
[00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.010] got
[00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.210] this
[00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.690] embarrassed
[00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.110] phone
[00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.450] call,
[00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.250] which
[00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.450] said
[00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.770] something
[00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.030] along
[00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.190] the
[00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.470] lines
[00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.870] of,
[00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.010] turns
[00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.250] out
[00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.610] other
[00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.030] people
[00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.410] want
[00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.690] that,
[00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:46.030] too.
[00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.190] And
[00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.550] I
[00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.750] said,
[00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.030] oh.
[00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.450] And
[00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.630] being
[00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.850] only
[00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:50.330] 26,
[00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.630] I
[00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.810] didn't
[00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.090] say,
[00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.970] ah,
[00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.230] we
[00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.510] own
[00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.690] the
[00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:53.070] tooling.
[00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.310] We
[00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.490] will
[00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.950] grind
[00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.210] you
[00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.390] into
[00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.570] the
[00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.890] dust.
[00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.470] I
[00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.650] didn't
[00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.850] say
[00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:56.030] that.
[00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.770] Instead
[00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.990] I
[00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.330] said,
[00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.970] that's
[00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.230] cool.
[00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.090] Make
[00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.190] them
[00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.330] for
[00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.490] other
[00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.770] people,
[00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:00.030] too.
[00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.870] So
[00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.010] they
[00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.170] did.
[00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.570] But
[00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.730] the
[00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.330] surprising
[00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.750] thing
[00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.050] about
[00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.230] it,
[00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.390] and
[00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.530] the
[00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.710] thing
[00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.850] that
[00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.010] made
[00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.170] me
[00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.490] puzzle
[00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.770] about
[00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.910] the
[00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.330] conventional
[00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.830] wisdom
[00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.390] about
[00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.630] how
[00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.130] breakthroughs
[00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.290] come
[00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.630] about,
[00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.610] was
[00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.850] the
[00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:10.630] advertisements
[00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.990] these
[00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.370] people
[00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.610] then
[00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.830] put
[00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.990] into
[00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.170] the
[00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.390] trade
[00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.790] press,
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.200] which
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.400] were
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.840] fascinating.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.000] They
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.160] had
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.420] real
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.940] pronoun
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.360] trouble.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.200] It
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.620] was,
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.400] they
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.860] said
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.020] it
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.380] couldn't
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.560] be
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.860] done.
[00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.390] They
[00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.890] said
[00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.010] it
[00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.170] was
[00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.470] against
[00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.750] the
[00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.990] laws
[00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.150] of
[00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.550] nature.
[00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.570] But
[00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.010] we
[00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.550] knew,
[00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.530] deep
[00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.930] down,
[00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:28.130] that
[00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:28.250] you
[00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:28.390] would
[00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.570] need
[00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.730] this
[00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.890] thing.
[00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.430] So
[00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.530] I
[00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:29.670] thought,
[00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.150] gee,
[00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.970] maybe
[00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:31.390] it
[00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.750] isn't
[00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.290] true
[00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.410] that
[00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.610] the
[00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.850] way
[00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:34.110] this
[00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.330] thing
[00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:34.870] works
[00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:35.570] is
[00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.730] the
[00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:36.070] way
[00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.490] that
[00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:36.690] one
[00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.210] is
[00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.690] taught
[00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:37.930] that
[00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:38.030] it
[00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.290] works.
[00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.590] So
[00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:39.250] that's
[00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:39.390] why
[00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.510] I
[00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.710] began
[00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.930] to
[00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:40.250] study
[00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.510] these
[00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.790] kinds
[00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.950] of
[00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.290] things,
[00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:42.390] to
[00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.870] understand,
[00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.430] once
[00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.550] you
[00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.650] know
[00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:43.790] how
[00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.970] it
[00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:44.310] works,
[00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:44.510] you
[00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.610] can
[00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:44.930] understand
[00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.050] how
[00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.170] to
[00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.290] make
[00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.410] it
[00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:45.690] better.
[00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.430] And
[00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.610] these
[00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.690] are
[00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:46.830] the
[00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.150] kinds
[00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.270] of
[00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.450] things
[00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.590] we're
[00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:47.690] going
[00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:47.730] to
[00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:47.850] be
[00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.050] talking
[00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.250] about
[00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:48.350] in
[00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.510] this
[00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.930] class.
[00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:49.590] And
[00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:49.750] then,
[00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:50.030] just
[00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:50.910] FYI,
[00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.210] the
[00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.610] kinds
[00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:51.810] of
[00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.170] things
[00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:52.430] that
[00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.610] we
[00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:52.770] have
[00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.150] studied
[00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.450] these
[00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.830] phenomena
[00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.370] on
[00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.450] are
[00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:55.730] both
[00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.190] industrial
[00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:56.410] and
[00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:56.750] consumer
[00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.250] products.
[00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.950] And
[00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.030] on
[00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:58.130] the
[00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.510] consumer
[00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.890] product
[00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.170] side,
[00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.430] it's
[00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.670] things
[00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.110] like
[00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.170] skateboards
[00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:02.450] and
[00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.710] wonderful
[00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.010] stuff
[00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.210] like
[00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:03.490] that.
[00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.050] And
[00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.510] if
[00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.590] we
[00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:04.670] get
[00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.750] a
[00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:04.850] little
[00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.150] time
[00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.390] today,
[00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.570] I'm
[00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.630] going
[00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:05.690] to
[00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:05.850] show
[00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:05.950] you
[00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.030] a
[00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:06.190] little
[00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:06.890] piece
[00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.990] of
[00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.130] a
[00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:07.430] video
[00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.210] that
[00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.090] actually
[00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.510] shows
[00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.810] the
[00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.190] innovators
[00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:11.390] of
[00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.890] skateboards.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.280] And
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.520] they're,
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:13.720] of
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:13.840] course,
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.100] all
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.660] 13.
[00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.950] OK,
[00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:17.570] now,
[00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.170] periodic
[00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:19.810] major
[00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.250] innovation
[00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:20.430] is
[00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.890] essential.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:22.880] Everything
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.340] becomes
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:23.500] a
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:23.820] commodity
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.400] eventually
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.880] and
[00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.390] may
[00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.610] even
[00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:26.770] be
[00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.150] entirely
[00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:27.690] supplanted.
[00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:29.810] 3M
[00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.210] Scotch
[00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:30.510] Tape,
[00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:30.710] do
[00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.730] you
[00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:30.890] even
[00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.990] know
[00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.110] what
[00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.270] that
[00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.590] is?
[00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.570] Yeah,
[00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:32.750] you
[00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.830] know
[00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:32.930] what
[00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:33.150] Scotch
[00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:33.350] Tape
[00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.490] is,
[00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:33.710] right?
[00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:33.910] I
[00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:33.990] mean,
[00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.090] it's
[00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:34.430] generic
[00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.830] now,
[00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.150] right?
[00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.430] That
[00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:36.650] was
[00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.110] invented
[00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.130] decades
[00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:38.630] ago.
[00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.590] And
[00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:40.710] then
[00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:40.910] how
[00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:41.050] did
[00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:41.210] they
[00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:41.450] keep
[00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:41.650] that
[00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.030] going?
[00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.510] They
[00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:43.810] did
[00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:44.390] marginal
[00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.110] improvements.
[00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:46.490] You
[00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.550] know,
[00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.710] you
[00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.850] could
[00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.150] write
[00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.330] on
[00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:47.490] the
[00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:47.770] tape,
[00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:47.990] oh,
[00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.350] cool.
[00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.490] Double
[00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.770]-sided
[00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:50.050] tape.
[00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:50.210] What
[00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.350] they
[00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.690] noticed
[00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:50.930] was
[00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.110] that
[00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.470] people
[00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.130] were,
[00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.550] I
[00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.650] don't
[00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:52.770] know,
[00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.970] you've
[00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.170] probably
[00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:53.350] done
[00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.510] that
[00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:53.810] yourself,
[00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.310] they
[00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.430] were
[00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.710] making
[00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.950] sort
[00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:55.010] of
[00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:55.170] a
[00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.430] loop
[00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.610] of
[00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:55.770] this
[00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.130] stuff,
[00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.690] right?
[00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:58.290] And
[00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:58.730] taping
[00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.830] it
[00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:58.910] and
[00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:59.050] saying,
[00:08:59.330 --> 00:08:59.570] oh,
[00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.070] OK,
[00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:00.370] double
[00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:00.710]-sided,
[00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.670] right?
[00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.470] Then
[00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.650] they
[00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.010] noticed
[00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:03.390] that
[00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:03.610] one
[00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:03.710] of
[00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.850] the
[00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:04.090] things
[00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:04.250] that
[00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.630] happened
[00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.870] when
[00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.010] you
[00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:05.150] did
[00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.370] this
[00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:05.770] loop
[00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:06.270] was
[00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:06.410] you
[00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.550] could
[00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.810] put
[00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:06.910] it
[00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.030] on
[00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.190] a
[00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.510] lumpy
[00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:07.890] wall
[00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:08.070] and
[00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.130] it
[00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.250] would
[00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:08.450] still
[00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:08.630] be
[00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.030] OK.
[00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:10.110] And
[00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.290] when
[00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:10.490] they
[00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:10.710] had
[00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.850] their
[00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.110] double
[00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.390]-sided
[00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:11.870] tape,
[00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:12.030] it
[00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.370] wouldn't
[00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:12.570] because
[00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:12.730] the
[00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:12.930] tape
[00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.110] was
[00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.450] thin.
[00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:14.410] So
[00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:14.510] they
[00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:14.570] said,
[00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:14.810] oh,
[00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:15.110] OK,
[00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:15.690] foam
[00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.190] tape,
[00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:16.970] double
[00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.250]-sided
[00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:17.750] foam
[00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.070] tape.
[00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.290] So
[00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.390] they
[00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:18.530] put
[00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.810] foam
[00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:18.930] in
[00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:19.030] the
[00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.170] middle
[00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:19.650] to
[00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:19.790] do
[00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.930] what
[00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.030] you
[00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.170] were
[00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:20.370] doing
[00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:20.650] here.
[00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.430] And
[00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.730] all
[00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.010] these
[00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.790] variations,
[00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.770] decorated
[00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:25.130] gift
[00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.470] tapes,
[00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:25.670] they
[00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.950] noticed
[00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.150] that
[00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.390] people
[00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:26.790] used
[00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.010] this
[00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.310] stuff
[00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.550] to
[00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:27.810] wrap
[00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.370] packages.
[00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.370] So
[00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:29.470] they
[00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.590] said,
[00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:30.010] great,
[00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.270] we'll
[00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:30.490] print
[00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:30.630] the
[00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.990] decoration
[00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.410] on
[00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:31.550] it.
[00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:31.790] That
[00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.930] one
[00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:32.110] didn't
[00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.250] go
[00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:32.450] very
[00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:32.670] well
[00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.830] because,
[00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:32.970] of
[00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.070] course,
[00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.190] it
[00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.370] never
[00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:33.730] matched
[00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:33.970] your
[00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.070] paper.
[00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.810] Aspirin,
[00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:38.910] look
[00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.070] at
[00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.330] that
[00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:39.750] stuff.
[00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.930] Buffered,
[00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.590] coated,
[00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.430] child
[00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.870]-sized,
[00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:43.770] flavored,
[00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.470] liquid.
[00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.030] You
[00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.210] have
[00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:46.430] this
[00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.810] basic
[00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:47.290] innovation.
[00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.570] You
[00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:48.750] can
[00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.230] spin
[00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.390] it
[00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:49.570] out
[00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:49.790] for
[00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.930] a
[00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.250] long
[00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:50.730] time.
[00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.710] And
[00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:53.190] incremental
[00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.750] innovation
[00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:54.150] is
[00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.450] very
[00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:54.910] important.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:56.820] But
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.040] to
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.440] get
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:57.780] the
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.300] stuff,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:58.580] the
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.060] basic
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.660] innovation,
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.220] to
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.560] spin
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:00.880] out
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.200] over
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.600] time
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.820] is
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:02.960] a
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.180] crucial
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:03.560] matter.
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:04.480] You
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:04.860] have
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.020] to
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.200] do
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:05.340] it
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:05.580] once
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:05.680] in
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:05.740] a
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.040] while.
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.420] Companies
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:07.620] are
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:07.900] aware
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.060] of
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:08.160] it.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:08.620] They
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:08.940] generally
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.200] don't
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:09.420] know
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:09.780] how.
[00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.030] Now,
[00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.570] in
[00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:13.830] this
[00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.130] class,
[00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.390] I'm
[00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:16.470] going
[00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.510] to
[00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:16.650] be
[00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:16.870] telling
[00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.050] you
[00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:17.230] about
[00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.650] breakthrough
[00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.610] versus
[00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.070] incremental
[00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:19.610] innovation.
[00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.010] So
[00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.130] we
[00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:20.250] ought
[00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:20.590] to
[00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:21.150] discuss
[00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.490] that
[00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:21.710] for
[00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.830] a
[00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:21.930] minute.
[00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.210] And
[00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:24.430] this
[00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.230] term,
[00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:25.510] people
[00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:25.650] have
[00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:25.830] used
[00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.310] breakthroughs
[00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.390] in
[00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:26.590] lots
[00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.750] of
[00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.110] ways,
[00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:27.690] technical
[00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.230] breakthrough
[00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.810] and
[00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:28.990] so
[00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.110] on
[00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.210] and
[00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.370] so
[00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:29.630] forth.
[00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.290] But
[00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.470] what
[00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.670] we're
[00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.010] talking
[00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:31.370] about
[00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.950] is
[00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:32.170] the
[00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:32.610] first
[00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.130] member
[00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:33.550] of
[00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.690] a
[00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:33.970] major
[00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:34.430] product
[00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.750] line
[00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.870] in
[00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.990] the
[00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.270] firm.
[00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.850] So
[00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:37.390] in
[00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:37.750] scientific
[00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.330] instruments,
[00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:38.490] it
[00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:38.550] would
[00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.630] be
[00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.830] the
[00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:39.230] first
[00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.590] gas
[00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.270] chromatograph.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.400] And
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:42.680] then
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.300] improved
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.680] gas
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.560] chromatographs
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.460] would
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:46.600] be
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.200] improvements,
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:47.660] incremental
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.160] improvements.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:49.740] Analogously,
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:50.620] masking
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.140] tape.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:52.980] The
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.400] first
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.060] masking
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.240] tape,
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:54.380] the
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:54.580] idea
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:54.760] that
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:54.860] you
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.040] could
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:55.240] sort
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:55.340] of
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:55.680] mask
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:55.900] for
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:56.340] painting
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:56.600] and
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:56.840] so
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.040] on.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:57.240] And
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.560] then
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.660] improvements
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:58.960] to
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.220] that
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:10:59.380] so
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:10:59.460] that
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.520] you
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:10:59.580] can
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:10:59.680] go
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:10:59.860] around
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.340] corners
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:00.500] a
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:00.600] little
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.080] better
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.360] and
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:01.620] better
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.440] dispensers
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:02.600] and
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:02.720] all
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:02.800] the
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:02.960] rest
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.100] of
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.260] that
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:03.660] would
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:03.840] be
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.260] incremental.
[00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:08.710] Now,
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.520] as
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:10.640] I
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.020] mentioned,
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.560] why,
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:12.760] of
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:12.980] course,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.120] in
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.440] developing
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.140] breakthroughs?
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.200] Because
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.800] periodically,
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.100] they're
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:16.500] essential.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.460] Now,
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:18.940] I'm
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.620] astonished
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.600] at
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.000] how
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.220] rare
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:22.420] they
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:22.600] are.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:22.780] But
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:22.920] they're
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.360] essential.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:24.660] And
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:24.900] firms
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.040] are
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.240] pretty
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.440] good
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:25.580] at
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:25.900] incremental
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.420] innovation,
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:26.940] but
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.080] they
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.360] don't
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:27.520] know
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:27.660] how
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:27.800] to
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.120] develop
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.240] breakthroughs
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:29.600] systematically.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:31.640] And
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:31.740] the
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.060] result
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.400] is
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:32.580] that
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:32.960] major
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.460] innovations
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:33.740] are
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.120] often
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.960] very
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.300] rare
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:35.800] and
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.200] desperately
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:36.500] sought
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.680] by
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.080] management.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:37.780] Now,
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.280] you'll
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:38.560] see
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:38.760] as
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:38.900] we
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.040] go
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.500] along
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:39.740] that
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:39.960] we've
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.220] done
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:40.840] work
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:40.980] in
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.200] a
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.420] bunch
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:41.580] of
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.000] companies
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.300] sort
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:42.400] of
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:42.640] showing
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:42.800] them
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:42.940] how
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.040] to
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.160] do
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:43.500] this.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:45.880] And
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.360] the
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.900] histories
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.140] of
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:47.320] these
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:47.780] companies
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.220] in
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:48.580] terms
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.100] of
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.040] how
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.580] often
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.040] they
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.360] come
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:51.520] up
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:51.700] with
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.060] something
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.660] fundamental,
[00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:54.270] it's
[00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:54.770] amazingly
[00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:55.190] rare.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.340] I
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:57.460] mean,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:57.700] if
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:57.860] you
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.020] think
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.220] about
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:58.560] companies
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:58.760] that
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:58.940] you
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.140] know
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:11:59.400] about,
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:11:59.660] look
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:11:59.820] at
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.000] Dell
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.480] Computer.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.600] What
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:02.720] have
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:02.840] they
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.020] done?
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:03.260] They've
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:03.480] done
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:03.720] this
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:03.860] sort
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:03.940] of

[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.480] it
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:04.620] to
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:04.980] demand
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:05.380] thing.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:06.280] And
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:06.420] they've
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:06.560] been
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:06.820] doing
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:07.100] that
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.300] and
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:07.560] doing
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:07.800] that
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:07.920] and
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.100] doing
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.420] that.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:10.740] Is
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:10.900] there
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.040] a
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.280] major
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:11.820] innovation
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.020] in
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.240] there
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.280] beyond
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:13.720] that?
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.040] Not
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.380] clear.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:16.260] And
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:16.440] yet,
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:16.680] look,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:16.800] they
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.000] built
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.220] this
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:17.740] huge
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:18.080] company
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.260] on
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:18.500] it.
[00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.810] So
[00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:19.910] in
[00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.030] a
[00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.330] way,
[00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:21.170] what
[00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.590] happens
[00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.950] is
[00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:22.570] that
[00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:22.990] these
[00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.670] companies,
[00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.270] you'll
[00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:25.450] see
[00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:25.630] that
[00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:25.790] there
[00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:26.230] becomes
[00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.810] resistance
[00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.050] to
[00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.410] innovating
[00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.710] again
[00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.910] because
[00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.070] you're
[00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:28.190] sort
[00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.290] of
[00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:28.490] built
[00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.750] into
[00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:28.890] the
[00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:29.030] way
[00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.170] you
[00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:29.330] used
[00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:29.430] to
[00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.590] do
[00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.890] things.
[00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.090] One
[00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:30.170] of
[00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.250] the
[00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:30.410] things
[00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:30.570] we'll
[00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:30.790] talk
[00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.990] about
[00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.110] is
[00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.470] resistance
[00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.690] to
[00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.110] innovation.
[00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.150] But
[00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.350] what
[00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.550] you'll
[00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.690] see
[00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:33.830] is
[00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:33.950] that
[00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:34.110] these
[00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:34.510] huge
[00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.030] companies
[00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.270] often
[00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:36.790] are
[00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.410] engines
[00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:37.670] with
[00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.830] but
[00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:37.970] a
[00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.250] single
[00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:38.690] idea.
[00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.390] And
[00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:41.510] if
[00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:41.590] you
[00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.730] can
[00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.030] come
[00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.190] up
[00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:42.310] with
[00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.570] another
[00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:42.910] one,
[00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:43.990] you've
[00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.170] done
[00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:44.650] something
[00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.510] humongous
[00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:45.710] for
[00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.950] them.
[00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.430] OK.
[00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:52.690] Now,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.440] what
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:55.620] we'll
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:55.860] talk
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.020] about
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.160] in
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.340] this
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:56.940] class
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.220] is
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:57.460] not
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:57.920] only
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.300] sort
[00:12:59.530 --> 00:12:59.650] of
[00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.010] how
[00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:00.210] to
[00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:00.430] do
[00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.630] it,
[00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.370] but
[00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:02.590] we'll
[00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.830] bring
[00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:02.990] up
[00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.150] the
[00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.610] problem
[00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.990] that
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.460] it's
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:06.880] hard
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.120] to
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:07.460] implement
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:07.920] even
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.140] if
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.260] you
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:08.480] know
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:08.720] what
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:08.880] to
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.120] do.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:11.780] You
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:11.960] know,
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.440] it's
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:12.660] funny.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.040] Yesterday,
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.180] I
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.280] was
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.560] talking
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:13.760] to
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:13.960] a
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.400] company
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:14.540] I
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:14.580] was
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:14.840] calling
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.360] Ralston
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.160] Purina,
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:16.380] which
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:16.520] is
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:16.760] a
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.440] dog
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:17.660] food
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:17.960] company
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.140] or
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:18.280] something.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:20.940] And
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.420] we
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:21.520] were
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:21.760] talking
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:21.960] about
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.480] innovations.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.100] And
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.180] we
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:23.280] were
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:23.520] talking
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:23.700] about
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:23.820] the
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.140] fact
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.840] that
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:24.960] they
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.200] really
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.420] have
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:25.660] two
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:25.940] major
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:26.340] problems.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:26.680] One
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:26.840] is
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.020] to
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.300] find
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.480] the
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:27.880] innovation.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.320] And
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:29.460] the
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:29.680] other
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:29.960] is
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.140] to
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:30.440] implement
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:30.680] it.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:31.800] And
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:31.960] that
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.780] implementation,
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:33.680] actually
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.140] getting
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.460] this
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:34.720] thing
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:34.940] through
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.120] the
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.460] company,
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:36.520] is
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:36.700] an
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.000] equally
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.380] difficult
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:37.780] job.
[00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.350] You
[00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.550] know?
[00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.570] Companies
[00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:40.970] just,
[00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:41.430] you're
[00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.630] from
[00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:41.950] Moog,
[00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.130] eh?
[00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:42.690] You're
[00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.110] nodding
[00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.310] as
[00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.550] to,
[00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:44.110] yes,
[00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.530] yes,

[00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.010] there,
[00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.250] done
[00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:45.610] that.
[00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:47.910] Now,
[00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.670] it's
[00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.830] sort
[00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:49.910] of
[00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:50.370] amazing

[00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.190] at
[00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:51.370] this
[00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:51.610] thing
[00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:51.730] and
[00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:51.830] you
[00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.070] say,
[00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.550] well,
[00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.370] innovation's
[00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:53.890] obviously
[00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:54.110] a
[00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.270] good
[00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:54.730] thing,
[00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.530] right?
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:13:59.580] Who
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:13:59.820] could
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:13:59.960] be
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.240] against
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.440] it?
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:01.920] And
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.060] then
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:02.180] you
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.380] see
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:02.580] these
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.140] amazing
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:03.560] things
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:03.840] like,
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:03.980] you
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.180] know,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:04.420] for
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:04.680] instance,
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:04.940] that
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.100] the
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:05.340] British
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:05.960] introduced
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.740] lime
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.100] years
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.460] ago.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:08.940] They're
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.160] called
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.560] limees,
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:09.660] and
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:09.720] they
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.060] introduced
[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.520] lime
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:10.660] to
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:10.880] their
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.220] sailors
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:11.900] as
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.000] a
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.100] way
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.220] to
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:12.480] prevent
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:12.940] scurvy.
[00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:15.190] It
[00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:15.630] took,
[00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:16.110] after
[00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.350] the
[00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.970] demonstration
[00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.250] that
[00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:18.430] this
[00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.650] was
[00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:19.230] by
[00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.810] naval
[00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:20.070] people
[00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:20.590] themselves,
[00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.530] it
[00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:21.790] took
[00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.330] 200
[00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.010] years
[00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.350] to
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.380] introduce
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:25.680] it,
[00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:26.630] to
[00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:26.810] actually
[00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:27.030] get
[00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.150] it
[00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.350] in
[00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.810] there
[00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.790] to
[00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.990] the
[00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.210] Navy.
[00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:31.490] Meanwhile,
[00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.990] as
[00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.170] they're
[00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:32.530] sailing
[00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:32.990] along,
[00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.410] they're
[00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.830] throwing
[00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:34.190] half
[00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.410] their
[00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:34.770] crews
[00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.330] overboard,
[00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.210] dead,
[00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:36.510] needless
[00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:36.670] to
[00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:36.890] say,
[00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:37.790] of
[00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.250] scurvy.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.040] 200
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:40.360] years.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:40.660] And
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:40.760] then
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:40.860] it
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.000] took
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.500] another
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.180] 50
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:42.840] years
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.040] to
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:45.780] get
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:45.880] it
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.040] over
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.160] to
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.280] the
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:46.540] merchant
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:46.920] marine.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.020] Now,
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.140] these
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:50.540] kinds
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:50.700] of
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:50.900] things
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.120] are
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.640] stunning.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:52.660] And
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:52.820] we
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.100] tend
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.320] to
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:53.600] stand
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:53.900] around
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:54.120] and
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.300] say
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:54.640] things
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:54.900] like,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.660] well,
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.160] must
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:57.440] be
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.020] because
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:58.680] not
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.080] invented
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.440] here.
[00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:01.570] But
[00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:01.750] what
[00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.910] it
[00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:02.250] really
[00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:02.890] is,
[00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:04.650] is
[00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.590] that
[00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.910] there's
[00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:06.370] enlightened
[00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:06.830] self
[00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:07.290] interest
[00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.010] involved
[00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.210] in
[00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:09.630] whether
[00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:09.870] you
[00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:10.110] do
[00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.290] or
[00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:10.450] do
[00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:10.810] not
[00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:11.510] innovate.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:13.980] Firms
[00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.090] are
[00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:15.530] built
[00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.130] around
[00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:16.850] doing
[00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.690] something
[00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:18.570] efficiently.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.140] If
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.360] you
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:21.840] introduce

[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:24.660] do
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:24.900] is
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.560] disrupt
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:25.840] the

[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.780] which
[00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:28.610] allow
[00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:29.050] them
[00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.290] to
[00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:30.570] sort
[00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:30.670] of

[00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.250] you
[00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:42.570] produce.
[00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:42.730] The

[00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:53.790] You're
[00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.090] thinking,
[00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.670] if

[00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:58.490] while
[00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.630] we
[00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:58.810] figure
[00:15:58.810 --> 00:15:58.910] out

[00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.230] do
[00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.530] this.
[00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.850] No,

[00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.790] that.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:03.820] So
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.120] you'll
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.440] find

[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.260] firm,
[00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:06.500] it's
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:06.660] a
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:06.860] matter
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:07.060] of
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:07.280] life
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:07.460] and
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:07.800] death,
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:08.260] you
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:08.440] will
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:08.860] find
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:09.460] that
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:09.920] within
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.420] the
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.180] firm
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:13.640] as
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.200] departments
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:14.480] and
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.020] individuals,
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:15.300] there
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:15.460] are
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:15.720] lots
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:15.880] of
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.220] reasons
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:16.620] to
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:16.840] not
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.020] do
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.220] it.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.260] Change
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:20.760] obsoletes
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.140] corporate
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:21.700] expertise
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:21.860] and
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.160] production
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:22.720] investments.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:23.780] Polaroid
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.140] produces
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:24.520] instant
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:24.800] film
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:24.940] and
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.340] cameras.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:26.900] Remember
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.080] the
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.240] death
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.380] of
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:27.800] Polaroid,
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.000] right?
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:29.780] The
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.020] death
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.200] of
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.520] Polaroid
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:30.680] was
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.280] fascinating
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.360] because
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.020] they
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.540] were
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:35.980] always
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.300] coming
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:36.820] around
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.000] to
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.340] MIT
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.400] and
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:38.800] saying,
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:39.400] you
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:39.540] know
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:39.760] what?
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:39.920] We
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.120] really
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:40.300] should
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:40.440] get
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:40.600] into
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:40.960] digital,
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.320] right?
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:41.580] OK,
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:44.920] we're
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.020] going
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.100] to
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.240] set
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:45.340] up
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:45.460] a
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:45.700] group
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:45.860] to
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.000] do
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.340] digital.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.280] And
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:47.380] they
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:47.520] would
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:47.800] set
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:47.920] up
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.060] this
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.240] group
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:48.400] to
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:48.540] do
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:48.880] digital.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:49.800] And
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.040] that
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:50.380] group
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:50.600] would
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:50.880] get
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.420] beaten
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.020] on.
[00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.470] They
[00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.610] would
[00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:54.810] look
[00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:54.930] at
[00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:55.150] these
[00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.610] things.
[00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:56.410] You'd
[00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:56.630] create
[00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:56.790] a
[00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.050] digital
[00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.490] image.
[00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:58.130] They'd
[00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:58.270] look
[00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:58.390] at
[00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:58.570] this
[00:16:58.570 --> 00:16:58.750] thing
[00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:58.850] and
[00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.990] they'd
[00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.150] say,
[00:16:59.330 --> 00:16:59.690] that's
[00:16:59.690 --> 00:16:59.870] not
[00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.030] as
[00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.190] good
[00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:00.310] as
[00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.450] what
[00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:00.590] we
[00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.930] normally
[00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:01.250] do.
[00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:02.390] That's
[00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:02.570] no
[00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:02.890] good.
[00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.590] Close
[00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.870] down
[00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.010] the
[00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.210] group.
[00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.030] And
[00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.150] they
[00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.310] did
[00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:05.510] this
[00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.830] several
[00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:06.290] times.
[00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:07.410] We'll
[00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:07.530] get
[00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:07.750] into
[00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.070] why
[00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:08.270] this
[00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.510] might
[00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.730] be.
[00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:09.810] Kodak
[00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:09.970] is
[00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:10.070] a
[00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:10.290] current
[00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:10.870] example.
[00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.730] Change
[00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:13.230] devalues
[00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.370] your
[00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.670] personal
[00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.010] intellectual
[00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:14.490] property.
[00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:15.750] If
[00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.910] I
[00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.110] know
[00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.670] COBOL,
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:18.420] am
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:18.540] I
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:18.640] going
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:18.720] to
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:18.880] want
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.420] C++?
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:22.580] My
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.080] secretary,
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.180] years
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:24.460] ago,
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:24.900] when
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.020] they
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.160] were
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:25.580] introducing
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:25.880] word
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.300] processors,
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.460] she'd
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:29.580] have
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:29.680] to
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:29.800] learn
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:29.920] how
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.000] to
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.120] do
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.340] this
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:30.580] thing.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:31.780] It
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:31.940] wasn't
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.200] her
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:32.640] problem
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:32.820] how
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.120] quickly
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.280] the
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:33.520] paper
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:33.740] was
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.000] written.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.280] It
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:34.360] was
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.580] my
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:34.920] problem.
[00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.390] So
[00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.890] I
[00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.130] ordered
[00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:38.330] one
[00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.410] of
[00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:38.590] these
[00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.990] things.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.080] And
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.580] it
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:41.780] should
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:41.880] have
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.040] come
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:42.360] in.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.040] And
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:43.140] it
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.280] should
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:43.380] have
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:43.500] come
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:43.780] in.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.080] And
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.320] finally,
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:45.500] I
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:45.780] asked
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:45.900] her.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.000] And
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.060] I
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.160] said,
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:46.320] well,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.520] so
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:47.780] where's
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:47.860] the
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:48.000] word
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.420] processor?
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:48.840] She
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:48.960] said,
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:49.080] oh,
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.160] I
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:49.260] had
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.360] it
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:49.680] installed.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:49.980] I
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.100] said,
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:50.360] good.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:51.360] She
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:51.460] said,
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.440] well,
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:52.760] where
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:52.900] is
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.020] it?
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:53.240] She
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.400] said,
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:53.520] oh,
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:53.600] I
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:53.720] had
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:53.840] it
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.140] installed
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.280] in
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:54.360] the
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:54.620] supply
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.040] closet.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.180] There
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:58.580] it
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:58.800] was,
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.360] firmly
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:17:59.800] wired
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:17:59.980] in
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.120] with
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.280] a
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:00.600] LAN
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.340] in
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:01.440] the
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:01.620] back
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:01.720] of
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:01.820] a
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.100] supply
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:02.320] closet.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.360] I
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:03.540] mean,
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:03.780] again,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.460] it
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:04.840] wasn't
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.060] that
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.240] she
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.560] said,
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:05.860] I
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.100] will
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.360] not
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:06.640] do
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.040] this.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:07.680] She
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:07.880] just
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.280] managed
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:08.480] to
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:08.660] make
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:08.820] it
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.220] impossible
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:09.520] to
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:09.860] proceed
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.020] to
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.160] the
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:10.380] next
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:10.720] step
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.900] with
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.040] the
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:12.280] best
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:12.700] goodwill
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:12.860] in
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.160] mind.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.260] OK,
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:14.980] so
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.700] now,
[00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:17.270] in
[00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.470] this
[00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.850] course,
[00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.690] we
[00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.830] are
[00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:20.930] going
[00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:21.030] to
[00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.270] talk
[00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.530] about
[00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.550] contrasting
[00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.110] innovation
[00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.610] methods.
[00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:24.210] We're
[00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:24.290] going
[00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:24.390] to
[00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.650] talk
[00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:25.170] about
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.200] fundamentally
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.080] different
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.740] ways
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.680] to
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.200] find
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:30.580] big
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.060] ideas
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.220] or
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:31.540] small
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:31.920] ideas
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.100] and
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:32.240] to
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:32.500] innovate.
[00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.950] The
[00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.470] traditional
[00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:36.010] methods
[00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:36.330] are
[00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:36.630] based
[00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.790] on
[00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.170] find
[00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:37.310] a
[00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.450] need
[00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:37.590] and
[00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.810] fill
[00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:37.970] it.
[00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.730] They
[00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:40.150] are
[00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.690] going
[00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:40.830] to
[00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:41.010] your
[00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:41.410] target
[00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:41.730] market
[00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.170] users
[00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:43.350] and
[00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.950] saying,
[00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.950] what
[00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:45.050] do
[00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:45.130] you
[00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:45.450] want?
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.000] As
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.200] you'll
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:48.560] see
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:48.840] as
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.000] we
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.340] go,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.360] that
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.620] ends
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:50.840] up
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.040] being
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:51.380] something
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:51.900] about
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:52.920] incremental
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.440] innovation.
[00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.930] And
[00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:55.330] then,
[00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:55.890] there
[00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:56.030] are
[00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:56.310] new
[00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.750] methods
[00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:57.430] based
[00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.610] on
[00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.130] finding,
[00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.870] encouraging,
[00:18:59.050 --> 00:18:59.570] commercializing
[00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.430] solutions
[00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:00.950] developed
[00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:01.170] by
[00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:01.470] users
[00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.990] themselves.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:03.420] So
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:03.600] for
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:03.880] example,
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.040] in
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:04.120] the
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:04.300] case
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:04.400] of
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:04.520] the
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:04.900] skateboard,
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:05.720] it's
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.160] not
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:06.720] that
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.040] you,
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:07.280] as
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:07.400] a
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:07.980] manufacturer,
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:08.940] go
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.440] and
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:09.860] interview
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.200] these
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.660] kids
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.720] and
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:11.820] say,
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.040] now,
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:12.360] children,
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:12.580] what
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:12.740] would
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:12.860] you
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.160] like?
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.220] Well,
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:15.840] let's
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.120] see.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:16.360] We
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:16.600] would
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:16.960] like
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.140] to
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:17.320] come
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:17.620] near
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.040] death.
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:19.960] And
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.620] so
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.380] probably
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:21.580] what
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:21.780] we'd
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.000] like
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.140] is
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.360] a
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:22.660] board
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.000] that's
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.300] totally
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.020] uncontrolled
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.240] that
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:24.400] will
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:24.600] allow
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:24.760] us
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:24.840] to
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:24.940] go
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.120] down
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:25.300] the
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:25.560] hill
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.300] and
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:26.580] come
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:26.800] near
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.100] death,
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:27.700] oftentimes.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:29.580] First
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:29.660] of
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:29.760] all,
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:29.920] a
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.180] manufacturer
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:30.300] would
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:30.460] probably
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:30.680] not
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.120] want
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.200] to
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.300] do
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:31.540] that.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:32.780] But
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.200] secondly,
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.660] they
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.120] couldn't
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.720] come
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:36.920] up
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.060] with
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:37.140] it.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.280] It
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:37.520] wouldn't
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:37.980] work.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.080] What
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.440] happened
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.000] instead
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.600] is
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:40.720] that
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:40.920] the
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.380] kids
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:41.860] started
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.200] building
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:42.760] skateboards
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:42.940] for
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:43.360] themselves.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.160] The
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.660] reason
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:44.820] they're
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.000] called
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.540] skateboards
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:45.740] is
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:45.860] they
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.040] took
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.500] skates
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:46.640] and
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:46.760] they
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:46.880] put
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:46.980] them
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:47.200] under
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:47.660] boards
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.700] and
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:48.880] went
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.180] sailing
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:49.380] down
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:49.520] the
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:49.700] hill.
[00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:51.010] So
[00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:51.170] the
[00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:51.590] kids
[00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.770] were
[00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:52.050] well
[00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:52.350] along
[00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.510] the
[00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.870] way.
[00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:54.090] This
[00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:54.490] group,
[00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.650] in
[00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:54.810] other
[00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.130] words,
[00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.630] lead
[00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.970] users
[00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:56.230] over
[00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.430] here
[00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.590] were
[00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.870] well
[00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:57.150] along
[00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:57.290] the
[00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:57.530] way
[00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:57.850] towards
[00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:58.310] innovation
[00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.610] by
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:19:59.780] the
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.200] time
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.020] this
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.280] group
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:01.480] knew
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:01.720] anything
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.020] about
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.200] it.
[00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:03.870] And
[00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.050] so
[00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:04.610] basically,
[00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:05.190] what
[00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.370] you'll
[00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:05.550] see
[00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:05.710] is
[00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.810] the
[00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:06.230] distinction
[00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.450] is
[00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:06.650] these
[00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.890] new
[00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:07.230] methods
[00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.430] that
[00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.850] actually
[00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:08.170] go
[00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:08.590] after
[00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.110] needs
[00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.570] and
[00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.050] solutions
[00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:10.290] at
[00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:10.410] the
[00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:10.610] same
[00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.970] time.
[00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:11.350] You
[00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.670] didn't
[00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:11.890] say
[00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:12.030] to
[00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:12.230] those
[00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.510] kids,
[00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:13.010] what
[00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:13.110] do
[00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.210] you
[00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:13.430] think
[00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.610] you
[00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:14.090] need?
[00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.010] You
[00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:15.170] said,
[00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.510] oh,
[00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.750] I
[00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:16.010] see
[00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.210] you're
[00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:16.570] careering
[00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:16.770] down
[00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:16.910] the
[00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:17.050] hill
[00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:17.190] on
[00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.290] a
[00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:17.710] skateboard,
[00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:18.790] aha.
[00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.090] And
[00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.210] then
[00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.330] you
[00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:20.490] bring
[00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:20.590] it
[00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.710] over
[00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.890] here,
[00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:21.070] whereas
[00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.390] these
[00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.810] people
[00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.030] would
[00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:22.230] say
[00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.490] something
[00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:22.930] like,
[00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.470] hmm,
[00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.750] I'd
[00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.890] really
[00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:24.070] like
[00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.270] my
[00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.610] bicycle
[00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:24.810] to
[00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:24.910] go
[00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:25.030] a
[00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:25.130] little
[00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.530] faster.
[00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:30.250] So
[00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:30.650] now,
[00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:31.290] what
[00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:31.450] I'm
[00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:31.530] going

[00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:32.630] the
[00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.890] next
[00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.010] bit
[00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.270] of
[00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.530] this
[00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:34.870] lecture
[00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:35.430] is
[00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.650] how
[00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:35.790] we
[00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:36.330] discovered
[00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:36.770] the
[00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:37.030] role
[00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:37.190] of
[00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.590] users.
[00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.030] And
[00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:39.190] to
[00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.430] do
[00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.810] that,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.080] I
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.260] just
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:41.440] have

[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.380] essential
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.040] definitions.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:46.460] What
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:46.680] we're
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.060] talking
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.300] about
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:47.560] here,
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:47.780] and
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:47.920] what

[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.120] also
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.420] important,
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:50.660] there's
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:50.780] going

[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.040] little
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:52.340] bit
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.560] where
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:53.640] you
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:53.780] get
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:53.900] to

[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.500] strategy.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.480] And
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:58.840] then
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.440] I
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:20:59.660] want

[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.040] And
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.440] then,
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.100] since

[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.160] And
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:15.300] we'll
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.480] do

[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:16.620] You'll
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:16.800] start
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:16.960] to

[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.380] with
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:17.520] this
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:17.840] stuff
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.080] and
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:19.620] sort
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:19.720] of
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:19.980] see
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.140] whether
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.280] you
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:20.640] believe
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.160] it.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:22.620] So
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.100] I
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.280] know
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:23.440] it's
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:23.580] much
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:23.740] more
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:23.920] fun
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.040] when
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:24.200] you
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:24.520] chat.
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:25.640] Your
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.040] time
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:26.200] to
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.460] chat
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:26.640] is
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:26.960] coming.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.580] So
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:29.760] what
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:29.920] we're
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.220] talking
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:30.580] about,
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.120] first
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.260] of
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:31.500] all,
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:31.980] is
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.300] let's
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:32.480] take
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:32.620] an
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.020] innovation.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.040] Innovation
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:34.280] is
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.020] actually
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.520] anything
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.220] new
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:36.740] that's
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:36.900] put
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.060] into
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.220] the
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:37.600] marketplace.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:39.760] It's
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.220] different
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:40.480] than
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:40.640] an
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.060] invention.
[00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.510] An
[00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.890] invention
[00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:44.190] is
[00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.330] a
[00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.590] legal
[00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.010] term
[00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:45.690] that
[00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:46.050] says
[00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:46.570] if
[00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:46.970] something
[00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:47.330] meets
[00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:47.710] certain
[00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:48.230] standards
[00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.410] of
[00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:48.810] novelty,
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:50.840] then
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.560] that
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.060] thing
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.940] is
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.100] an
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:53.420] invention.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:54.780] But
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:54.980] you
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.180] could
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.580] take
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:55.840] that
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.120] thing
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:56.280] that
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:56.360] you
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:56.760] developed,
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.000] say
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.260] something
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:57.640] wonderful
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:57.860] that
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.140] passes
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:58.340] the
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:58.580] standard,
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:58.780] like
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.060] anti
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.500]-gravity.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:00.940] You
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.080] could
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:01.320] take
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:01.540] anti
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:01.920]-gravity
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.080] and
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.180] you
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:02.320] could
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:02.480] throw
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:02.580] it
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:02.620] in
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:02.700] the
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:02.960] basement,
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:03.320] assuming
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:03.560] anti
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:03.800]-gravity
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:03.980] goes
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.240] down.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:04.880] You
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:04.980] could
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:05.100] throw
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:05.200] it
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:05.220] in
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:05.300] the
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:05.540] basement
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:05.800] and
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.120] store
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:06.300] it.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.700] Never
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:07.980] put
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.080] it
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:08.200] into
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:08.360] the
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:08.680] marketplace.
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:09.040] It
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.240] does
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:09.540] not
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:09.820] become
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:09.960] an
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.320] innovation.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.340] It's
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:11.700] only
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:11.880] an
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.220] innovation
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:12.460] when
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:12.600] it's
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.060] used.
[00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:15.330] An
[00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:15.810] innovation
[00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:16.070] can
[00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.170] be
[00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:16.390] something
[00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.830] trivial
[00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.110] or
[00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.390] non
[00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.810]-trivial.
[00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:18.690] It
[00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:18.790] can
[00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:18.950] be
[00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:19.150] anything
[00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:19.330] from
[00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:19.530] anti
[00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:19.890]-gravity
[00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.150] that's
[00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:20.470] used
[00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.610] to
[00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:20.710] a
[00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.850] new
[00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:21.110] pop
[00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.370]-top
[00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:21.530] on
[00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:21.670] a
[00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:21.970] can,
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:23.200] but
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:23.300] then
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:23.420] it's
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:23.520] an
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:23.860] innovation.
[00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.610] Now
[00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.750] we're
[00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.910] talking
[00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:26.070] about
[00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.250] the
[00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:26.590] functional
[00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:26.890] source
[00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:27.010] of
[00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:27.430] innovation.
[00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:28.710] An
[00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:29.050] innovation
[00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:29.310] is
[00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.490] a
[00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:29.810] user
[00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:30.270] innovation
[00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:30.690] when
[00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:30.790] the
[00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.110] developer
[00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.550] expects
[00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:31.790] to
[00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:32.030] benefit
[00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:32.310] from
[00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.670] using
[00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:32.910] it.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.320] Now
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:34.500] this
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:34.620] is
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:34.780] not
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.040] just
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:35.260] you
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:35.420] as
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:35.520] an
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:35.920] individual.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.260] This
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:38.420] is
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:38.600] you
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:38.980] also
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:39.180] as
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:39.360] a
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:39.640] firm.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:40.660] So
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:40.980] take
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.380] Boeing,
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:41.620] for
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.020] example.
[00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:44.450] Boeing
[00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.930] is
[00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:45.110] a
[00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.490] user
[00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.050] innovator
[00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.490] when
[00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.390] it
[00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.870] develops,
[00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.110] say,
[00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.230] a
[00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.370] new
[00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:49.830] machine
[00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:50.050] to
[00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:50.330] build
[00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.790] airplanes
[00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:51.430] because
[00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.570] it's
[00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:51.770] trying
[00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.930] to
[00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:52.170] use
[00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:52.450] it.
[00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:55.130] Boeing,
[00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:55.450] that
[00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:55.870] same
[00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:56.310] firm,
[00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.510] is
[00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.630] a
[00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:57.170] manufacturer
[00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:57.730] innovator
[00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.530] when
[00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:58.730] it
[00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:59.230] develops
[00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.390] a
[00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.490] new
[00:22:59.490 --> 00:22:59.770] airplane
[00:22:59.770 --> 00:22:59.990] to
[00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.230] sell.
[00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.310] OK?
[00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.570] So
[00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.990] you,
[00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.450] when
[00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:03.570] you
[00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:03.870] try
[00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:04.090] to
[00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:04.410] develop
[00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:04.970] something
[00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:05.510] to
[00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.770] protect
[00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:07.210] you
[00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:07.690] from
[00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:08.250] your
[00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:08.730] brother
[00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.150] when
[00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:09.310] you're
[00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.650] growing
[00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:09.910] up
[00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:10.030] or
[00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:10.230] your
[00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.610] sister,
[00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:11.790] and
[00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:11.910] there's
[00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.110] just
[00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.370] not
[00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:12.670] something
[00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:12.790] on
[00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:12.910] the
[00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:13.130] market
[00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.330] that
[00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:13.690] works.
[00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:14.710] You
[00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.870] just
[00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:15.170] cannot
[00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:15.610] buy
[00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:15.790] the
[00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.090] proper
[00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:16.450] brother
[00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:16.910] scaring
[00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:17.390] device.
[00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:18.070] So
[00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.190] you
[00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.310] have
[00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.430] to
[00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.750] develop
[00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.970] your
[00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:19.230] own.
[00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:20.390] Again,
[00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.670] you're
[00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:20.770] a
[00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:20.990] user
[00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.350] innovator.
[00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:21.530] You're
[00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:21.670] not
[00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:21.990] planning
[00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.170] to
[00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:22.430] sell
[00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.610] that
[00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.730] to
[00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:22.890] all
[00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:22.990] the
[00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.170] neighbor
[00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:23.550] kids.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.080] You
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:25.300] are
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:25.740] actually
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.240] doing
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:26.440] that
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:26.600] for
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.000] yourself.
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:28.220] So
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:28.540] whether
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:28.780] you're
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:28.860] an
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:29.280] individual
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.620] or
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:30.820] a
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.140] firm,
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.100] if
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:32.260] your
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:32.640] reason
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:32.860] is
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:33.040] to
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.360] use
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:33.540] it,
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.440] then
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:34.580] you're
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:34.680] a
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:34.920] user.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.080] If
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.660] your
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:36.920] reason
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.060] is
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:37.180] to
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:37.380] benefit
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.600] from
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:37.880] selling
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.000] it,
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:38.180] you're
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:38.280] a
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:38.740] manufacturer.
[00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.270] Now
[00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:42.470] I'm
[00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.510] going
[00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.570] to
[00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:42.690] give
[00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:42.970] you
[00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.930] three
[00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:46.130] slides
[00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.290] here
[00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:46.550] showing
[00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:46.770] how
[00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:46.930] we
[00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:47.170] do
[00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:47.610] this.
[00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:50.150] How
[00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:50.250] do
[00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:50.370] we
[00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:50.650] find
[00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:50.810] out
[00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.970] where
[00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:51.090] the
[00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:51.450] innovations
[00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:51.850] come
[00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:52.130] from?
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:53.800] Now
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.180] you
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:54.640] remember
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.920] that
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.040] I
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.400] told
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:56.580] you
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:56.760] that
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:56.920] the
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.280] standard
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:57.720] model
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:57.960] is
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.200] find
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:58.460] a
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:58.640] need
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:58.780] and
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.000] fill
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.200] it.
[00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:01.090] That
[00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:01.250] is,
[00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.450] the
[00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:02.090] manufacturer
[00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.550] goes
[00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:03.230] and
[00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.570] takes
[00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:03.810] a
[00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:04.130] look
[00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.790] to
[00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:05.110] see
[00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.350] what
[00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.750] average
[00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.070] users
[00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.490] want.
[00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:06.910] Makes
[00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:07.190] sense.
[00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:07.410] They're
[00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:07.490] the
[00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:07.750] target
[00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:08.090] market.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:09.520] And
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:09.660] then
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:09.840] comes
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.080] back
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:10.200] and
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.600] innovates.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.360] So
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:12.520] what
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:12.660] we
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:12.860] wanted
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:13.040] to
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:13.200] do
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:13.380] was
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:13.500] to
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:13.800] see
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.000] whether
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.200] this
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:14.340] was
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:14.540] true.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:14.700] Now
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:14.840] this
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.040] happens
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.160] to
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:15.240] be
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:15.540] scientific
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.060] instruments,
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:16.300] but
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:16.460] what
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:16.620] we
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:16.920] actually
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.340] did
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:17.840] was
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.020] this
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.260] over
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:18.440] a
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:18.640] bunch
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:18.780] of
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.140] things,
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.180] like
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.800] sports
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.300] equipment
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:21.500] and
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:21.620] so
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:21.720] on
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:21.820] and
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:21.960] so
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.180] forth.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.160] The
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:23.480] point
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:23.780] here
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.180] is
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.840] that
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.040] what
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.240] we
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:25.480] do
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:25.660] is
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:25.800] we
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.440] take
[00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.690] these
[00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:28.310] product
[00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.910] lines.
[00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:29.210] You
[00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.370] see,
[00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.510] if
[00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.670] you're
[00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:29.830] a
[00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:30.330] manufacturer,
[00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:31.150] you
[00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:31.310] have
[00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.530] a
[00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:31.770] product
[00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.190] line,
[00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:32.470] right?
[00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:33.730] These
[00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:34.130] represent
[00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.590] product
[00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.890] lines
[00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:35.030] for
[00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:35.170] your
[00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:35.510] company.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:36.980] So
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.180] what
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:37.360] would
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:37.460] you
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:37.660] like
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:37.840] to
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.040] know?
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:38.420] You'd
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:38.600] like
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:38.780] to
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:38.960] know
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.240] where
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:39.400] the
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:39.900] major
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.380] innovations
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:40.800] come
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.080] from
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:41.280] over
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:41.660] time.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:42.620] If
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:42.760] there's
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:42.920] a
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.280] pattern
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:43.500] in
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:43.740] that,
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.720] then
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:44.820] you
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:44.960] can
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.120] do
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:45.220] it
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:45.480] again.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.500] If
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:47.660] you
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.120] mistake
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:48.320] what
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:48.480] the
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:48.740] pattern
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.200] is,
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.040] then
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:50.220] in
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:50.480] fact,
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:50.840] you're
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.020] going
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:51.300] about
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:51.420] it
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:51.540] the
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:51.680] wrong
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:51.940] way.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:52.460] And
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:52.600] you'll
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:52.740] see
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:52.900] that
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.060] this
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:53.180] is
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:53.300] the
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:53.600] case.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.160] So
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:55.560] find
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:55.680] a
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:55.820] need
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:55.960] and
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.140] fill
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:56.240] it
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:56.400] would
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:56.680] say,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.100] these
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.460] major
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:57.940] improvements
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:58.500] consist
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:58.660] of
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.000] us
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.260] going
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:24:59.480] out
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:24:59.640] there
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:24:59.740] to
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:24:59.900] the
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.260] field
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:01.180] and
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:01.640] figuring
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:01.940] out
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.180] what's
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:02.500] needed.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.140] User
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:04.560] innovation
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:04.800] would
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.140] say
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:05.500] the
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:05.700] user
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.100] develops
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:06.500] it.
[00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:10.350] So
[00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.750] what
[00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.850] did
[00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.970] we
[00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:11.230] do?
[00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.870] We
[00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:12.030] went
[00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:12.210] out
[00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:12.330] into
[00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:12.510] the
[00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.850] field
[00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.210] and
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:14.680] we
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:14.880] looked
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.000] at
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.180] the
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:15.520] first
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:15.960] company
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.180] to
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:16.840] commercialize
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.080] each
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:17.200] of
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:17.360] these
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:17.580] things.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:17.680] In
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:17.800] this
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.000] case,
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:18.120] it
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:18.160] was
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.600] instruments,
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:18.800] and
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:18.880] there
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:18.960] were
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.180] about
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:19.420] 100
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:19.820] plus.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:21.940] We
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.180] said
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.260] to
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.420] them,
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.760] who
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.100] invented
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:24.360] this
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:24.680] wonderful
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.120] device?
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:25.340] You
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:25.480] or
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:25.760] somebody
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.100] else?
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:28.700] And
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:28.820] they
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.060] said,
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:29.360] well,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.100] we
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.300] did,
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:30.520] my
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:30.780] son.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:32.560] Oh,
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:32.920] damn.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:34.680] Conventional
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:34.880] wisdom
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.060] is
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:35.260] right
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:35.560] after
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:35.740] all.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:35.900] This
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:36.020] is
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.280] so
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:36.820] painful.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:37.380] So
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:37.520] we
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:37.660] would
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:37.900] push
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.060] the
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:38.240] matter.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:38.400] We
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:38.560] would
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:38.800] say,
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:39.800] well,
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.240] did
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:40.320] you
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:40.500] get
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:40.660] any
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:40.940] input
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.180] from
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:41.540] users
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:41.860] living
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:42.060] or
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.340] dead?
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.300] Certainly
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:44.660] not.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:45.540] And
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:45.640] when
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:45.760] you
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:45.980] sell
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:46.140] us
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.300] our
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:46.560] gold
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:46.920] plaque,
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.100] be
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.220] sure
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:47.340] to
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:47.500] spell
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:47.660] our
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:47.840] names
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.060] right.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.100] Well,
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:50.560] we
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:50.720] then
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:50.840] went
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:50.960] into
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.120] these.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:51.260] We
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:51.380] were
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:51.540] all
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.040] techies.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:52.240] So
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:52.420] now
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:52.540] we
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:52.660] were
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.080] exploring
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:53.260] to
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:53.380] see
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:53.500] where
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:53.660] these
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:53.980] innovations
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.360] came
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:54.580] from,
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:54.880] and
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.020] our
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:55.260] goal
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:55.460] was
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:55.600] to
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:55.820] find
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:55.960] out
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.100] whether
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:56.460] users
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:56.700] had
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:56.840] anything
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.060] to
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:57.180] do
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:57.300] with
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:57.480] it.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.380] So
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:58.480] we
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:58.600] would
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:58.860] talk
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:58.980] to
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.120] these
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:25:59.320] people,
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:25:59.440] and
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:25:59.500] we
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:25:59.540] would
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:25:59.660] say,
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:25:59.980] OK,
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:00.620] well,
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.580] let's
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:01.700] see
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:01.820] what
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:01.920] we
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.040] can
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.220] do
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:02.440] here
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:02.640] to
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:02.920] make
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:03.900] lemonade
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.060] out
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:04.180] of
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:04.480] lemons.
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:04.980] Can
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.140] you
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:05.340] tell
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:05.480] us
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:05.620] how
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:05.800] this
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.180] innovation
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:06.640] occurred?
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:07.940] And
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.020] they
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:08.120] would
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:08.340] start
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:08.500] the
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:08.800] story
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:08.940] with
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.140] great
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:09.600] confidence.
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:09.840] But
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.200] always
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:10.340] as
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:10.480] we
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:10.760] pushed
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:10.960] toward
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.100] the
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.480] beginning
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:11.700] of
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:11.860] the
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:12.300] story,
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:13.300] there
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:13.440] was
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:13.640] this
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:13.980] funny
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.240] little
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:14.660] glitch,
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:15.220] which
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:15.640] was
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.380] that
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:16.480] at
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:16.600] the
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:16.980] beginning
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.220] of
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:17.380] the
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:17.840] story,
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:18.600] it
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:18.980] appeared
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.180] that
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:19.980] oftentimes
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.480] the
[00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:22.690] story
[00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:22.870] would
[00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:23.130] start
[00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:23.370] with
[00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:23.970] the
[00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:24.290] ceiling
[00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:24.630] opened
[00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.830] up
[00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:25.050] one
[00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:25.250] day
[00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.350] and
[00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.490] a
[00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.830] prototype
[00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:26.210] fell
[00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.490] out.
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.020] You'd
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.160] sort
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:29.240] of
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:29.380] say,
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:29.520] well,
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:29.920] hell
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.040] of
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:30.200] a
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.500] ceiling.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:31.860] I
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.040] wish
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.200] I
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:32.360] had
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:32.500] a
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:32.720] ceiling
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:32.980] like
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:33.260] that.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.560] Well,
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:34.840] when
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:34.980] we
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:35.220] went
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:35.740] behind
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:36.020] it,
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.360] we
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:37.640] found
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:37.800] out
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:37.940] that
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.080] in
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.420] 80
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:38.660]%
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:38.840] of
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:38.960] the
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.320] cases,
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.340] it
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:40.440] was
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:40.800] actually
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.020] the
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.340] users
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:41.580] that
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:41.680] had
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.040] developed
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:42.300] it.
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:42.820] And
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:42.980] those
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:43.120] were
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:43.580] users'
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.140] prototypes
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:44.380] that
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:44.520] fell
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:44.660] out
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:44.720] of
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:44.840] the
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.060] ceiling.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.080] And
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:46.660] that
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.360] was
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:47.520] a
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:47.720] very
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.060] different
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.320] take
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:48.420] on
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:48.520] the
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:48.840] innovation
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.340] process.
[00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:51.130] So
[00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:51.330] for
[00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:51.830] example,
[00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:53.130] lead
[00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:53.290] in
[00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:53.570] blood.
[00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:54.150] Children
[00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:54.390] eat
[00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.650] paint
[00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:54.810] off
[00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:54.950] the
[00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:55.210] wall
[00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:55.690] containing
[00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:56.130] lead
[00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:56.950] because
[00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:57.090] it
[00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:57.290] tastes
[00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:57.610] sweet.
[00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:57.750] And
[00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.970] the
[00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:58.610] level
[00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:58.890] of
[00:26:58.890 --> 00:26:59.110] lead
[00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.210] that
[00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.310] was
[00:26:59.310 --> 00:26:59.590] causing
[00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.710] the
[00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.890] brain
[00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:00.270] damage
[00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:00.730] could
[00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:00.910] not
[00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:01.090] be
[00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:01.350] seen
[00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.490] with
[00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.590] the
[00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.970] instruments
[00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:02.150] at
[00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:02.190] the
[00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.470] time.
[00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:04.170] So
[00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:04.570] who
[00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:04.970] improved
[00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:05.130] the
[00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:05.470] instruments?
[00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:06.030] Well,
[00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:06.310] it
[00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.650] was
[00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:07.090] the
[00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:07.470] doctors
[00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:07.770] doing
[00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:07.970] the
[00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:08.350] studies.
[00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:09.610] Then
[00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:09.730] what
[00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:09.910] would
[00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:10.250] happen
[00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.510] is
[00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.670] they
[00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:10.850] would
[00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:11.410] publish
[00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:11.610] the
[00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:12.110] information
[00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.330] about
[00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:12.490] how
[00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:12.630] to
[00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.810] do
[00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:12.970] it.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.000] And
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.580] five
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:15.820] to
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.240] seven
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:16.700] years
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.160] later,
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.060] people
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:19.280] would
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:19.520] start
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:19.960] pounding
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.200] on
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.460] these
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.060] commercializing
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:21.300] instrument
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:21.540] companies
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:21.820] saying,
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.260] for
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:22.600] God's
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:22.680] sake,
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:22.900] we're
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.180] sick
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:23.360] of
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:23.900] modifying
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:24.160] this
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.500] equipment
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:24.660] in
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:24.780] the
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.160] lab.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.080] Why
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.260] don't
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:26.360] you
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:26.600] just
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:26.940] make
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.100] your
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:27.340] darn
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:27.780] machine
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.040] that
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:28.520] way
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:28.620] in
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:28.700] the
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:28.880] first
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.220] place?
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:30.720] Now,
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:30.940] that's
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.140] a
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:31.600] hugely
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.220] different
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.240] version
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:33.400] of
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:33.500] the
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:33.880] innovation
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.540] process.
[00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.710] It
[00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:37.390] converts
[00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:37.810] the
[00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:38.390] whole
[00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.010] issue
[00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:39.350] about
[00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.730] how
[00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:39.930] you
[00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:40.330] find
[00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:40.850] innovations
[00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.450] from
[00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:42.670] the
[00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:43.010] issue
[00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.310] of
[00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.690] how
[00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:43.850] do
[00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.990] we
[00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.470] invent
[00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:45.110] internally
[00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.390] the
[00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:45.610] next
[00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:45.850] new
[00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:46.290] thing
[00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.610] to
[00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:47.990] how
[00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.110] do
[00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.230] we
[00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.730] find
[00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:48.910] the
[00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:49.110] next
[00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.410] new
[00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:49.670] thing
[00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:49.930] out
[00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:50.250] there.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:51.660] We'll
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:51.780] get
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:51.920] into
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.120] that
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:52.420] later.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:53.340] But
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:53.680] here's
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:53.920] the
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.980] data
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.340] on
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:55.680] this
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.940] where
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.080] you
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.440] see
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:57.980] that
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:58.420] basically
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:58.600] these
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:58.800] are
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:58.960] all
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.080] the
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.300] major
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:27:59.680] improvement
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.260] innovations.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:01.500] All
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:01.680] the
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:01.940] first
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.160] ones
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.300] were
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:02.440] done
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:02.620] by
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:02.940] users,
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:03.180] and
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:03.300] the
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:03.540] major
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:03.960] improvements,
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:04.220] 80
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:04.460]%
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:04.620] of
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:04.720] them.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:05.260] Now,
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:05.740] to
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:06.020] say
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.380] done
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:06.580] by
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.000] users,
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:07.220] we
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:07.540] don't
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:08.000] mean
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.480] that
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:08.660] the
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:08.900] user
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.180] just
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.460] had
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:09.640] the
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.080] idea.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:10.700] We
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:10.880] mean
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.020] that
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:11.160] the
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.380] user
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:11.760] built
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:11.960] it
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.180] and
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:12.480] used
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:12.800] it,
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.120] actually
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:14.420] built
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:14.580] it.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.280] Now,
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:15.900] what
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.040] I'm
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:16.100] going
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.180] to
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.340] do
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:16.500] to
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:16.640] give
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:16.740] you
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:16.840] a
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.060] feeling
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:17.240] for
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:17.400] this
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:17.540] is
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:17.680] I'm
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:17.760] going
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:17.820] to
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.000] show
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.100] you
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:18.280] some
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:18.760] examples.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:20.940] And
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.040] then
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.220] you're
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:21.300] going
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:21.400] to,
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:21.600] as
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:21.720] I
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:21.900] say,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.120] have
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:22.280] your
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:22.520] own.
[00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:26.210] So
[00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:26.570] here
[00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.670] we
[00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:26.930] go.
[00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:28.710] Here's
[00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:29.150] an
[00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:29.630] automated
[00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.010] radio
[00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:30.610] immunoassay
[00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:31.010] system.
[00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:31.890] This
[00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:32.030] was
[00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:32.310] actually
[00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.690] done,
[00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.130] it's
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:34.260] an
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:34.540] example
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:34.680] of
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:34.740] a
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:34.960] scientific
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.340] instrument
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:35.920] system.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:36.080] It
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.160] was
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.280] the
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:36.500] first
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:36.820] one.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:37.460] It
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:37.580] was
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:37.820] done
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.000] in
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.220] the
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:38.720] University
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:38.900] of
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.220] Virginia
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.680] by
[00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.810] people
[00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:43.030] who
[00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.230] had
[00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.350] to
[00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.470] do
[00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:43.630] a
[00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.870] heart
[00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:44.310] study.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.260] And
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:46.360] they
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:46.520] had
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:46.620] to
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:46.740] do
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.180] 20
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:47.640],000
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.160] analyses.
[00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:51.030] Now,
[00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:51.530] before
[00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:51.790] this,
[00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:52.030] these
[00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:52.410] analyses
[00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:52.630] were
[00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.810] done
[00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:52.990] by
[00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.350] hand.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:55.400] And
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:55.580] you
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:55.720] can
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:55.860] get
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:55.960] a
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.220] graduate
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:56.500] student
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:56.640] to
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:56.720] do
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:56.860] a
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:56.980] lot
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.120] of
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:57.440] stuff.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:58.760] But
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:58.920] you
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.200] can't
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:28:59.360] get
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:28:59.540] even
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:28:59.700] a
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.080] graduate
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.500] student
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.380] to
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:01.540] do
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:01.680] it
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.100] 20
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.560],000
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.120] times.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.140] So
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:04.280] what
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:04.360] do
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:04.420] you
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:04.660] do?
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:05.580] You
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:05.980] start
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.220] to
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:06.700] work
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.140] and
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:07.480] make
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:07.900] something
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.180] that'll
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:08.360] do
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:08.480] it
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:08.760] for
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:08.940] you.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.500] Necessity
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:09.640] is
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:09.760] the
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:09.900] mother
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.060] of
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:10.420] invention,
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:10.720] right?
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:12.700] So
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:12.920] what
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.080] they
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.340] did,
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:13.540] though,
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:13.720] is
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:13.860] they
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.120] didn't
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:14.440] start
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:14.660] from
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.340] scratch
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:15.520] and
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:15.860] nothing.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.300] They
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:16.560] took
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.080] pieces
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:17.400] of
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:17.720] things
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:17.880] that
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.060] were
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.540] around.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:19.780] They
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.000] took
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.120] a
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:20.220] little
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:20.660] sampling
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:20.940] thing
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:21.260] here.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:21.660] They
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:21.800] took
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:21.980] a
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.360] pump
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:22.520] that
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:22.660] was
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.100] commercial.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:23.980] They
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.120] took
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.520] valves
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:24.680] and
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:24.820] so
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:24.940] on.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:25.100] They
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:25.240] took
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:25.360] a
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:25.680] computer
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:25.860] that
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.000] was
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.360] commercial.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.000] And
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.120] they
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.420] built
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:27.640] the
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:27.980] pieces
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.220] and
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:28.400] put
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:28.500] it
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:28.820] together
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.020] to
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:29.160] do
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:29.300] what
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:29.420] they
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:29.640] needed
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:29.820] to
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.020] do.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.200] Now
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.400] we
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:32.620] begin
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:32.780] to
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.320] understand
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:33.580] why
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.080] companies
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:34.340] might
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:34.660] think
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:34.840] that
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.000] they
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.260] do
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:35.440] it.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:36.920] Because
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.200] this
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:37.700] thing,
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:38.200] this
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:38.600] user
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.100] prototype,
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:39.620] is
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:39.860] not
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.280] ready
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:40.500] to
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:40.700] have
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.000] Hewlett
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.400] Packard
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:41.800] slapped
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:41.920] on
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.040] the
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.260] corner.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:42.940] Can't
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.120] ship
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.220] it
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:43.400] like
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:43.720] this.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:44.560] Got
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:44.640] to
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:44.760] do
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:44.860] a
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.040] lot.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:45.520] Looks
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:45.780] better
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.080] later.
[00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.710] But
[00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:47.890] the
[00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:48.450] operating
[00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.050] principles
[00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:49.950] are
[00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:50.250] there.
[00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.730] This
[00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.030] is
[00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:52.210] the
[00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:52.590] way
[00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.970] that
[00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:53.090] the
[00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.430] commercial
[00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.670] one
[00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:53.870] was
[00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:54.110] built.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.440] Now
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:56.760] once
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:56.900] we
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.180] began
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:57.300] to
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:57.680] understand
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.000] this
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.140] in
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:58.400] scientific
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:58.780] instruments,
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:58.960] we
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.160] began
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:29:59.320] to
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:29:59.440] see
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:29:59.620] these
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:29:59.780] things
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:29:59.960] all
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.100] over
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:00.220] the
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:00.540] place.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:01.280] Anybody
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:01.440] know
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:01.560] what
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:01.740] that
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.000] is?
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.120] Any
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:05.560] clue?
[00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:08.790] Do
[00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:08.790] you
[00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:08.950] remember
[00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:09.090] we
[00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:09.230] used
[00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.310] to
[00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.390] have
[00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:09.490] a
[00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:09.630] Mount
[00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.890] St.
[00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:10.930] Helens?
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:12.660] And
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:12.760] then
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:12.860] it
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:13.020] turned
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:13.180] to
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:13.380] dust
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:13.620] one
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:13.860] day.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:14.360] Remember,
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:14.520] it
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:14.660] blew
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:14.880] up?
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.160] This
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:16.280] is
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:16.440] two
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:16.660] days
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:16.940] later.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:19.880] And
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.320] basically,
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:20.720] what
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:20.860] you
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.180] see
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:21.380] is
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:21.660] user
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:22.100] innovation.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:22.920] These
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.020] are
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:23.300] police
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:23.640] cars.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.440] And
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:25.700] what
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:25.860] we
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.100] have
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:26.360] here
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:27.080] is
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.100] the
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:28.460] problem
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:28.740] was
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:28.860] that
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.000] the
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.300] cars
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:29.460] were
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:29.900] stopping
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.180] because
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:30.280] there
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:30.360] was
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:30.500] so
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:30.660] much
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:30.960] dust
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.100] in
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:31.220] the
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:31.400] air.
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.260] There
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:32.800] was
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:32.900] so
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.020] much
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:33.180] dust
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:33.300] in
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:33.360] the
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:33.420] air
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:33.540] that
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:33.700] the
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:33.900] air
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.200] filter
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:34.360] of
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:34.460] the
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:34.720] car
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:34.880] that
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.000] was
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.280] normally
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:35.620] there
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:35.840] would
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.020] just
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:36.380] immediately
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:36.580] get
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.000] blocked,
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:37.740] and
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:37.860] the
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:38.040] cars
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:38.220] wouldn't
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.460] run.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:40.700] So
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:40.940] this
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:41.100] is
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:41.280] two
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:41.520] days
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:41.820] later,
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:41.980] and
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.100] the
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:42.520] solution's
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:42.680] not
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:42.920] fully
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:43.760] standardized,
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:43.900] you
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.140] understand?
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:45.660] But
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.060] what's
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.240] going
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:46.480] on
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:46.760] here
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.440] is
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.060] that
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:48.260] they're
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:48.680] taking
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:48.980] what's
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:49.400] around
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:49.680] to
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:49.940] solve
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.140] their
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:50.540] problem.
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:51.620] So
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:51.800] this
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:51.920] is
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.040] the
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:52.240] kind
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:52.340] of
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:52.500] a
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:52.820] hose
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:53.120] that
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:53.240] we
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:53.400] use
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:53.480] in
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:53.540] the
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:53.680] United
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:53.940] States
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.180] to
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:54.880] attach
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.060] our
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:55.360] dryer
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:55.540] to
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:55.680] the
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:55.880] wall,
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.060] our
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:56.320] clothes
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:56.600] dryer.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:57.940] Flexible
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:58.280] plastic
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:58.620] hose.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:30:59.940] This
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.120] is
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:00.440] duct
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:00.780] tape,
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.180] the
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:01.600] universal
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:01.960] anti
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.440]-solvent.
[00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:03.910] And
[00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:03.970] you
[00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:04.090] can
[00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:04.250] see
[00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:04.430] here,
[00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:04.670] what
[00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:04.990] happens
[00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.170] is
[00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:05.390] one
[00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:05.550] end
[00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:05.730] goes
[00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:05.850] to
[00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:05.990] the
[00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.250] engine,
[00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:06.470] and
[00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.570] the
[00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:06.710] other
[00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.850] end
[00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:06.990] goes
[00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.110] to
[00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.210] the
[00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:07.370] big
[00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.630] filter
[00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:08.090] system.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:09.420] So
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:09.720] here
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.120] appears
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.240] to
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:10.320] go
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:10.400] to
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:10.500] the
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:10.920] prisoner's
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.200] lungs
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:11.480] as
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.120] a
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:12.340] pre
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:12.600]-cleaning
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.000] device.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:14.400] But
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:14.720] actually,
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.300] what's
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:15.480] going
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:15.660] on
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:15.800] there
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:15.940] is
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.140] I
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:16.520] called
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:16.640] them
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:16.760] up
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:16.880] and
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.100] asked.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:17.220] I
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:17.320] was
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:17.480] trying
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:17.560] to
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:17.660] get
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:17.780] my
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:17.920] data
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.220] firsthand.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:18.420] So
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:18.640] they
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:18.900] actually
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.380] said,
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:19.660] no,
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:19.820] no,
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:19.980] no.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:20.120] We
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:20.240] would
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:20.420] never
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:20.600] do
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:20.820] that.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:20.940] We're
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:21.080] not
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:21.240] that
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:21.440] dumb.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:21.940] So
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:22.080] what
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.200] we
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:22.300] did
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:22.440] was
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:22.540] we
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:22.660] ran
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:22.800] the
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:22.960] hose,
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.080] and
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.160] it
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:23.320] goes
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:23.440] into
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:23.600] the
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:23.880] trunk
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.200] through
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:24.440] the
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:24.840] back
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.420] thing,
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:25.680] whatever.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:25.860] So
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:25.960] they
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.080] have
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:26.160] a
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.260] big
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:26.540] filter.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.220] Now,
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:28.600] why
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:28.740] do
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:28.880] you
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.600] suppose
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.840] that
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:31.940] the
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:32.860] manufacturer
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:33.120] didn't
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:33.220] do
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:33.340] that?
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:33.580] Why
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:33.800] didn't
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:33.940] the
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:34.160] user
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.480] write
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:34.700] a
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:34.900] letter
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.120] to
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:35.260] the
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:35.700] Purulator
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:36.180] company
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.560] saying,
[00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.270] we've
[00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:38.350] got
[00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.630] trouble
[00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.830] out
[00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.990] here.
[00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:39.170] Want
[00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:39.250] to
[00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:39.350] do
[00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.610] something?
[00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:41.310] Why
[00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.410] do
[00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:41.550] you
[00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:41.770] think?
[00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:42.410] Anybody
[00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:42.570] got
[00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:42.710] any
[00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.050] reasons?
[00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:45.550] It
[00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:45.690] would
[00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:45.870] take
[00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:46.210] forever.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:48.740] Yeah.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:49.560] Why
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:49.680] would
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:49.760] it
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:49.940] take
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.300] forever?
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:50.760] Because
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.120] the
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:51.460] company
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:51.840] would
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:51.840] have
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:51.960] to
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.380] discuss
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:52.600] it,
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.160] design
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:53.360] it,
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:53.720] discuss
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:53.940] it
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.300] again,
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:54.840] review
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.380] it,
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:57.800] put
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.100] together
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:58.320] a
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:58.580] prototype,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.280] test
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:31:59.480] it,
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:31:59.900] market
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.340] test
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:00.660] it.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:01.060] Yeah.
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:01.920] Advertise
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.120] it.
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:02.760] Sell
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:02.980] it.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:04.860] So
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:05.460] something
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:05.860] about
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:06.120] the
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:06.620] fact
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.720] that
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:07.860] you
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:08.340] couldn't
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:08.600] get
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:08.860] it.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.200] You
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:10.500] had
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:10.660] to
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:10.800] do
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:10.920] it
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.340] yourself.
[00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:13.350] So
[00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.490] they
[00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.710] did.
[00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:15.630] So
[00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:15.890] now
[00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:16.070] we
[00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.430] begin
[00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.590] to
[00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.750] get
[00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.930] an
[00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:17.390] inkling
[00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:17.710] about
[00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:18.150] why
[00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:18.630] users
[00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.950] might
[00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:19.170] do
[00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:19.450] these
[00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:19.710] things
[00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.870] for
[00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:20.350] themselves.
[00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:21.210] What
[00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:21.410] you'll
[00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:21.610] find
[00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:21.730] is
[00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:21.910] not
[00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:22.330] all
[00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:22.770] users,
[00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.490] but
[00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.030] users
[00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:24.330] in
[00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:24.550] a
[00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.010] jam,
[00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:25.830] necessity
[00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:26.090] is
[00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.230] the
[00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.390] mother
[00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:26.530] of
[00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:26.910] invention,
[00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:27.870] are
[00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:28.170] often
[00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:28.350] the
[00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.730] beginning
[00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:29.310] edges
[00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:30.130] of
[00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:30.470] major
[00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.030] innovations.

[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.160] are?
[00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.990] Yeah.
[00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:46.190] Yeah.
[00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:47.230] Yeah,
[00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.650] it's
[00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:47.790] not
[00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:47.890] a
[00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:48.090] crop
[00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:48.390] circle
[00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:48.590] in
[00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.730] the
[00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:49.130] traditional
[00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.510] sense.
[00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:52.910] Here
[00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:53.230] it
[00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:53.350] is
[00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.530] in
[00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:53.870] Saudi
[00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:54.110] Arabia
[00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.290] for
[00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:54.530] greater
[00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.010] contrast.
[00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:57.330] Basically,
[00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:57.850] it
[00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:57.970] was
[00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:58.150] a
[00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:58.490] major
[00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.030] innovation
[00:32:59.030 --> 00:32:59.370] in
[00:32:59.370 --> 00:32:59.970] agriculture.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.220] And
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:03.620] the
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:03.960] great
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.480] insight
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.140] was
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:05.960] that,
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:06.300] gee,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.620] we
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.140] have
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:08.400] an
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.020] aquifer
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.060] in
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:11.320] lots
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:11.460] of
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:11.780] areas
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.200] that's
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.380] not
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:12.620] that
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:12.980] deep.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:14.340] It's
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:14.740] underlying
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.180] our
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:15.740] agricultural
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.220] land.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:17.560] And
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:17.700] what
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:17.860] they
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:18.100] used
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:18.260] to
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:18.460] do
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:18.660] was
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:18.760] they
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:18.920] used
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.060] to
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.260] dig
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:19.440] a
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:19.720] well.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:20.400] And
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:20.520] then
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:20.640] they
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:20.760] would
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:20.980] run
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:21.460] pipes
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:21.700] all
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:21.860] over
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:21.980] the
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.320] place.
[00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.510] And
[00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:23.610] then
[00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:23.690] they
[00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.790] would
[00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:23.910] have
[00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:24.050] to
[00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:24.250] pick
[00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:24.430] all
[00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.550] the
[00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:24.810] pipes
[00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:25.030] up
[00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:25.150] and
[00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:25.350] move
[00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.510] them
[00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:25.830] over
[00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:26.030] and
[00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:26.250] pump
[00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:26.610] again
[00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:26.790] and
[00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:26.930] so
[00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:27.050] on
[00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:27.110] and
[00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.190] so
[00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.290] forth.
[00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:27.630] Big
[00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.010] deal,
[00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.250] big
[00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.630] mess.
[00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.750] Basically,
[00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.050] they
[00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:30.150] were
[00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:30.450] using
[00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:30.630] the
[00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.890] well
[00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:31.090] as
[00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:31.230] a
[00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.470] scarce
[00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.910] resource.
[00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:33.410] But
[00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:33.610] what
[00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:33.870] these
[00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:34.110] guys
[00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.370] figured
[00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.550] out
[00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:34.690] was,
[00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.830] you
[00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.910] know,
[00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:35.030] we
[00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.130] can
[00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:35.250] go
[00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:35.530] 20
[00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:35.730] feet
[00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:35.950] down
[00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:36.090] into
[00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:36.210] the
[00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:36.430] ground,
[00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:36.530] and
[00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:36.670] we've
[00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:36.750] got
[00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.890] a
[00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:37.190] well.
[00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:38.110] So
[00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.350] why
[00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.450] don't
[00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.670] we
[00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:38.850] sort
[00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:38.990] of
[00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.690] make
[00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:40.370] giant
[00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.790] sprinkler
[00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:41.130] systems
[00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:41.370] with
[00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:41.630] wells
[00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.870] all
[00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:42.050] over
[00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:42.170] the
[00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:42.450] place?
[00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:43.150] And
[00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:43.290] so
[00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:43.430] that
[00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.570] was
[00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:43.690] a
[00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:43.930] major
[00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:44.130] sort
[00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:44.250] of
[00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:44.930] conceptual
[00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:45.350] breakthrough.
[00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:45.970] And
[00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:46.030] it
[00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:46.130] was
[00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:46.270] done
[00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:46.410] by
[00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:46.590] a
[00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:46.810] farmer.
[00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:47.230] And
[00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.430] here's
[00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.570] the
[00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.790] first
[00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.030] one.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:49.520] Isn't
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:49.620] that
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:49.920] cool?
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:53.760] Now,
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:53.880] you
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.020] can
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:54.360] see
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:54.540] by
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:54.880] looking
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.140] at
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:55.500] that
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.480] that,
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:56.980] again,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:57.440] what
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:57.680] the
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:57.960] farmer
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.280] has
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:58.740] done
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.000] is
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.460] taken
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:00.960] stuff
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.160] that
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:01.300] was
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:01.760] around.
[00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:03.910] That's
[00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:04.050] the
[00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:04.270] old
[00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:04.770] agricultural
[00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:05.250] pipe.
[00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.570] And
[00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:06.650] the
[00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:06.810] reason
[00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:06.950] this
[00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:07.010] is
[00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:07.150] a
[00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:07.370] favorite
[00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.550] of
[00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:07.790] mine
[00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:07.950] is,
[00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:08.130] and
[00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:08.510] one
[00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.610] of
[00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:08.630] the
[00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:08.770] things
[00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:08.870] I
[00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:08.950] did
[00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:09.010] in
[00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:09.130] my
[00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:09.490] misspent
[00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:09.770] youth,
[00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:09.930] is
[00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:10.090] I
[00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:10.310] was
[00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.590] actually
[00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:10.970] on
[00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:11.250] a
[00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:11.710] ranch.
[00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:14.490] And
[00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:14.890] we
[00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:15.090] did
[00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:15.290] this
[00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.750] process.
[00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.210] You'd
[00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:16.450] actually
[00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:17.130] have
[00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:17.350] a
[00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:18.070] tractor
[00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:18.830] dragging
[00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:19.370] these
[00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:19.710] sort
[00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.830] of
[00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:20.110] trailer
[00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:20.570] behind
[00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:21.090] with
[00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:21.250] these
[00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:21.570] 50
[00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:21.770]-foot
[00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:22.090] lengths
[00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:22.290] of
[00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:22.570] pipe.
[00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:23.050] And
[00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:23.170] you'd
[00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:23.310] have
[00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.450] to
[00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.730] throw
[00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:23.850] it
[00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:24.030] all
[00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.250] off
[00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:24.390] the
[00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:24.550] back
[00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.650] of
[00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:24.730] the
[00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:25.030] tractor
[00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.190] in
[00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.450] order,
[00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:26.050] and
[00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:26.150] then
[00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:26.310] you'd
[00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.470] have
[00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.590] to
[00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:26.710] sort
[00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.810] of
[00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.950] hook
[00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:27.050] it
[00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.210] all
[00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:27.350] up.
[00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:27.450] And
[00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:27.990] you'd
[00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.290] spray
[00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:28.530] the
[00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:28.910] crops.
[00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.050] And
[00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:29.170] then
[00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:29.330] you'd
[00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:29.490] pick
[00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:29.670] the
[00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:29.850] thing
[00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:30.010] up,
[00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.090] and
[00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:30.270] you'd
[00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.450] move
[00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:30.550] it
[00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.690] over
[00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:31.010] 50
[00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.330] yards
[00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:31.490] and
[00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.590] do
[00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:31.690] it
[00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:31.810] all
[00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:32.050] again.
[00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:33.730] And
[00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:34.090] so
[00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:34.530] because
[00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:34.690] you
[00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:34.790] could
[00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.950] never
[00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:35.190] throw
[00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.290] it
[00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:35.390] out
[00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:35.470] of
[00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.550] the
[00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.730] back
[00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:35.830] of
[00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:36.090] the
[00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:36.630] trailer
[00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.390] straight,
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:38.800] these
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.720] things
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:39.920] had
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.020] a
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:40.120] little
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:40.280] bit
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:40.400] of
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.040] the
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:41.380] give
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:41.540] in
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:41.660] the
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:41.940] coupling.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.180] So
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:42.320] it
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:42.440] would
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:42.580] do
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:42.740] like
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:42.900] this.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.080] So
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.280] what
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:43.680] the
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:43.880] guy
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.100] did
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:44.280] was
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:44.440] he
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.200] suspended
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:45.420] it
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:45.600] on
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:45.900] these
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.560] frames
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:48.720] that
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:48.800] he
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.040] welded
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.320] up.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.160] Then
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:50.340] this
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:50.440] is
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:50.600] the
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:50.760] same
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:50.980] old
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:51.380] pipe.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:52.580] And
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:52.840] this
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.140] is
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.100] agricultural
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:54.480] implement
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:54.880] wheels,
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:55.500] his
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:55.720] old
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:55.980] farm
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.320] tractor
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:56.660] wheels.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:57.480] And
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:57.700] this
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:57.840] is
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.260] sort
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:58.360] of
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:58.500] a
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:58.800] cylinder.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.000] And
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.120] what
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:34:59.220] he
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:34:59.440] used
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:34:59.680] to
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:34:59.960] do
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.240] was
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:00.440] to
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:00.660] run
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:00.800] the
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.040] water
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:01.340] through
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:01.700] here
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.340] and
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:02.740] divert
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:02.920] it
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.100] into
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:03.360] these
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:03.860] pistons
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:04.120] when
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:04.240] he
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:04.500] wanted
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:04.700] the
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:04.900] wheels
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:05.080] to
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:05.340] turn.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:06.520] And
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:06.760] these
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.240] wires
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:07.560] here,
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:07.940] basically
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:08.200] you'd
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:08.420] set
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:08.620] the
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.140] outermost
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:09.760] tower
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.080] going
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:10.300] like
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:10.520] this.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:10.600] It
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:10.700] would
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:10.880] create
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.020] a
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.180] bend
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:11.300] in
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:11.420] the
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:11.740] pipe.
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.280] And
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:12.400] that
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:12.520] would
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:12.780] turn
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:12.960] the
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.240] spigot
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:13.400] on
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:13.480] in
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:13.600] the
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:13.800] next
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:13.960] one,
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:14.040] and
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:14.120] the
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.260] whole
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:14.400] thing
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:14.500] would
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.620] sort
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:14.680] of
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:14.780] go
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:14.960] around
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.160] like
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:15.440] this.
[00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.510] It
[00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.590] was
[00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:16.750] pretty
[00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:17.070] cool.
[00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:18.250] And
[00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:18.650] it
[00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.950] was,
[00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.130] of
[00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.290] course,
[00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:20.010] commercialized.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:22.300] Here's
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:22.420] the
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:22.740] commercial
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.220] version.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:24.580] You
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:24.720] can
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:24.940] see
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.140] it's
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:25.540] considerably
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.020] glitzed
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:26.200] up,
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:26.440] right?
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:27.580] We're
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:27.780] talking
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:28.240] seriously
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:28.600] fancy
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:28.900] here.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:30.680] But
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:30.800] it's
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:30.940] the
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:31.120] same
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:31.520] operating
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:31.960] principles.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:33.680] So
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:33.900] I
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.060] could
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:34.240] not
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:34.620] resist.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.060] I
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:35.480] called
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:35.780] up
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:36.320] the
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:36.800] Valmont
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.220] company,
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:37.900] which
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.040] is
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.320] this
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:38.840] company
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.060] here.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:39.820] I
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:39.940] said,
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:40.320] did
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:40.440] you
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:40.660] get
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:40.860] any
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.320] inputs
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:41.580] from
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:42.040] users
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:42.440] living
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:42.720] or
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.080] dead?
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:44.420] And
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:44.520] they
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:44.760] said,
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.220] certainly
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:45.560] not,
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:45.780] my
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.160] child.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.040] It's
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:47.780] entirely
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.180] our
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:48.580] innovation
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:48.960] from
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.400] start
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:49.600] to
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:49.900] finish.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:50.980] I
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.040] was
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.200] like,
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:51.620] gee,
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.000] that's
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.200] really
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:52.620] interesting.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:53.620] So
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.300] it's
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:55.840] interesting
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.960] because
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.020] not
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.240] only
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:58.540] the
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:35:58.960] entertaining
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.340] value
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:35:59.600] here
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:35:59.760] of
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:35:59.920] there's
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.120] enough
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.400] credit
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:00.540] to
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:00.640] go
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:00.840] around
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.000] because
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.200] everybody
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:01.540] takes
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:01.760] it,
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.120] but
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:03.320] you'll
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:03.580] see
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:03.740] that
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:03.860] it's
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:04.120] very
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:04.580] interesting
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:04.760] in
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:04.920] the
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.180] sense
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:05.580] that
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:05.860] if
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.440] companies
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:06.980] don't
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.600] understand
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:07.800] where
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:07.960] their
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.280] innovations
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:08.660] come
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:08.980] from,
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:09.780] they
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.220] can't
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:10.360] do
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:10.460] it
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:10.720] again.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:12.220] And
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:12.360] so
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:12.620] often
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:12.800] when
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:12.900] I
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.020] go
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:13.120] to
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:13.320] these
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:13.840] companies
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.940] and
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.080] I
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:15.580] see
[00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:17.810] they're
[00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:18.130] aware
[00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:18.270] of
[00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.370] the
[00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:18.650] importance
[00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.830] of
[00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:19.130] history,
[00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:19.270] and
[00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.370] so
[00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.470] they
[00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.630] might
[00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.790] even
[00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:20.010] write
[00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:20.250] some
[00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:20.570] books
[00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:20.930] about
[00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:21.210] how
[00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:21.390] we
[00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.730] developed
[00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:21.930] our
[00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:22.410] innovations.
[00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:23.830] And
[00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:23.950] the
[00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:24.310] fascinating
[00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.590] thing
[00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:24.830] is
[00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:25.050] these
[00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:25.390] histories
[00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.570] are
[00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:25.790] usually
[00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:26.210] wrong.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:27.960] Here's
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.060] a
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:28.220] few
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:28.580] more.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:29.240] The
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:29.440] World
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:29.740] Wide
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:30.120] Web,
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.140] a
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:32.420] user
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:32.900] innovation.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.280] He
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:38.620] wasn't
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:39.100] Microsoft.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:40.800] He
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:40.920] wasn't
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.060] even
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:41.360] necessarily
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:41.560] a
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:41.860] customer
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.000] of
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.340] Microsoft.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:42.980] It
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:43.100] was
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:43.340] something
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:43.540] that
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:43.660] he
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.040] wanted.
[00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:48.350] Product
[00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:48.810] innovations
[00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:49.070] by
[00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:49.670] consumers.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.540] Personal
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:52.880] care.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.100] Anybody
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:53.360] know
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:53.580] about
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:53.920] protein
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.200]-based
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:54.680] hair
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.180] conditioners
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:55.300] and
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:55.480] stuff
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:55.660] like
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:55.920] that?
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:56.720] Know
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:56.860] about
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:57.140] those?
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:58.080] I
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:58.440] certainly
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:58.760] don't.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:58.900] But
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:36:59.180] anyway,
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:36:59.980] you
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.080] know
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.240] about
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:00.420] those?
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:02.100] It
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:02.600] helps
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:02.780] the
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:02.980] hair
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:03.620] somehow
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.080] in
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:04.220] some
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:04.540] magical
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:04.920] way.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:06.560] And
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.260] Procter
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:07.380] and
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:07.680] Gamble
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:07.880] or
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.180] whoever
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:08.460] was
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:08.680] very
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:08.960] proud
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.140] about
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:09.280] the
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:09.480] idea
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:09.640] that
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:09.820] they
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.160] had
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:10.620] come
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:10.760] up
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:10.900] with
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:11.180] this.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:12.340] But
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:12.760] before
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.460] that,
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:14.360] what?
[00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:17.110] Yes.
[00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:18.070] Yeah.
[00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:19.510] Yeah.
[00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:26.630] Avocado,
[00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:27.190] mayonnaise.
[00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.470] Yeah,
[00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:28.650] yeah,
[00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:28.910] yeah.
[00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:29.490] With
[00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:29.730] the
[00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.170] same
[00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:31.390] principle
[00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.710] being
[00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:32.230] involved.
[00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.510] So
[00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:34.630] in
[00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.770] other
[00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:35.030] words,
[00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:36.270] the
[00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.630] users
[00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.930] had
[00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:37.210] done
[00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:37.330] it
[00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:37.470] for
[00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.130] themselves.
[00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:40.230] Sports

[00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:40.970] mountain
[00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:41.370] bike.
[00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:43.570] The
[00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:43.850] mountain
[00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:44.090] bike
[00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:44.310] was
[00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.630] not
[00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.030] developed
[00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.570] by
[00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:47.010] Schwinn
[00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:47.210] or

[00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.110] Does
[00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:48.270] anybody
[00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.450] know
[00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:48.570] how
[00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:48.670] the
[00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.830] mountain
[00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:48.990] bike
[00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.130] was
[00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:49.390] developed?
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.040] It
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.120] was
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:53.680] developed
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.040] by
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.840] users
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.900] taking

[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:57.560] bike
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.380] and
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:58.540] saying,
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:58.640] you
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:37:58.740] know
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:58.900] what?
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.020] I'm
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.220] tired
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:37:59.320] of
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:37:59.460] riding
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:37:59.640] down
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:37:59.780] the
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:00.040] road.
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:00.900] Think
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.060] what
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:01.180] I'm
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:01.260] going
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.320] to
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:01.480] do
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:01.600] is
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:01.840] ride
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.000] down
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.140] a
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:02.320] mountain.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.000] So
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.160] they
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:04.500] ride
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:04.680] down
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:04.780] the
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:04.960] mountain
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.160] on
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:05.340] this
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:05.680] bike,
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.320] and
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:06.480] the
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:06.720] bike
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:06.880] would
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.180] fall
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:07.720] apart.
[00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:09.230] And
[00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.450] they'd
[00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:09.650] bring
[00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.790] it
[00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.950] to
[00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:10.210] the
[00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:10.570] dealer,
[00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:12.170] and
[00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.330] they'd
[00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:12.530] say,
[00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.830] hey,
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:14.600] there's
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:14.700] a
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:14.900] warranty
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:15.100] on
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:15.280] this,
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:15.520] right?
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:16.540] The
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:16.700] dealer
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:16.880] would
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.260] say,
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:17.900] uh,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.460] yeah.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.060] Looks
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.160] a
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:20.260] little
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:20.600] crushed
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:20.760] to
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:20.840] me.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.020] What
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:21.140] did
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:21.220] you
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:21.400] do
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:21.580] with
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:21.740] it?
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:22.640] Well,
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:22.780] I
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:22.860] rode
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:22.940] it
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.060] down
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:23.160] a
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:23.300] mountain.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:23.600] Oh,
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:23.880] well,
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.260] warranty
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:24.580] void.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:24.720] You
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:24.940] shouldn't
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:25.080] ride
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:25.180] it
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:25.320] down
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:25.620] mountains.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:25.820] It's
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.200] not
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:26.900] for
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.200] that.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.000] So
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.480] basically,
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:29.820] what
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.140] then
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:30.580] happened
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.260] was
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:31.420] that
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:31.720] these
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.160] kids
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.500] started
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:32.940] improving
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:33.100] the
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:33.420] bikes,
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:33.980] making
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:34.120] them
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:34.440] better,
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:34.900] making
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.040] them
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:35.300] stronger.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:35.480] Every
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:35.560] time
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:35.680] they
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:35.840] fell
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.120] apart,
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:36.440] they'd
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:36.600] fix
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:36.720] them
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:36.900] up.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:37.980] And
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:38.300] eventually,
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:38.500] you
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:38.660] ended
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:38.820] up
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:38.920] with
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.000] a
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.160] mountain
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:39.500] bike,
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.040] and
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:40.560] manufacturers
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:40.860] came
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.060] in.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:43.720] So
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.080] now,
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:44.320] I
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:44.540] want
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:44.840] you
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.340] to
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.140] think
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:46.340] about
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:46.500] it.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:47.280] Here's
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:47.380] your
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:47.920] exercise.
[00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.510] Identify
[00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.730] your
[00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:51.050] own
[00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.490] examples
[00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:51.710] of
[00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.930] user
[00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:52.290] innovation.
[00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:52.550] What
[00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.670] we
[00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.810] want
[00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:52.910] to
[00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:53.090] do
[00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:53.330] here
[00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:53.810] is
[00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:54.330] test
[00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:54.630] this
[00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:55.030] idea
[00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.330] out
[00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:55.470] in
[00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.630] your
[00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.890] own
[00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:56.370] minds,
[00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.210] OK?
[00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:57.790] So
[00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:57.950] what
[00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:58.070] I'm
[00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:58.430] proposing
[00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.690] is,
[00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:59.010] for
[00:38:59.010 --> 00:38:59.350] five
[00:38:59.350 --> 00:38:59.690] minutes,
[00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.470] you
[00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.630] take
[00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.730] a
[00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:00.870] look.
[00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.990] You
[00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.330] talk
[00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:01.450] to
[00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:01.590] your
[00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:01.810] neighbor
[00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:02.130] about
[00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.490] this.
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.260] Think
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:04.400] of
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:04.520] your
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.020] experience
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:05.220] as
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:05.320] in
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:05.500] a
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:05.840] firm
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.460] or
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:06.740] thinking
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:06.920] of
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.280] experience
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:07.480] as
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:07.600] a
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.060] consumer.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:10.280] In
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:10.340] the
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:10.480] case
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:10.580] of
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:10.700] a
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:10.920] firm,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.060] did
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:11.160] a
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:11.420] product
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:11.860] modification

[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:14.840] By

[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.020] way,
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.180] what
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:15.220] did

[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:16.900] Or
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.080] did

[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.240] something,
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:28.460] like
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:28.600] a
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:28.860] sport
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:28.980] or
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.200] type
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:29.300] of
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:29.500] cooking?
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:29.680] Did
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:29.740] you
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:29.880] ever
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.320] modify
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:30.520] a
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:30.740] commercial
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.180] product
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:31.340] you
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:31.600] bought?
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.300] So
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:34.600] say
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:34.840] hello
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.000] to
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:35.120] your
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:35.320] neighbor.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:35.540] Good
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:35.980] plan.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.080] And
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:37.480] tell
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:37.600] them
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:37.800] about
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:37.920] an
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.260] innovation
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:38.480] you
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:38.640] did
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:38.760] or
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:38.860] know
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.100] about
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:39.320] that's
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:39.420] a
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:39.640] user
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:39.980] innovation.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:40.400] Test
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:40.600] this
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:40.840] idea
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.100] out.
[00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.790] OK,
[00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:46.150] let's
[00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.430] see.
[00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:50.010] Who's
[00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:50.130] got
[00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:50.430] something
[00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.970] wonderful?
[00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:52.750] Usually,
[00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.150] what
[00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.370] happens
[00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:53.490] at
[00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:53.650] this
[00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:53.830] point
[00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:54.010] is
[00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:54.150] that
[00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.270] you
[00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.650] volunteer
[00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.870] the
[00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:55.170] person
[00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:56.090] next
[00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:56.230] to
[00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.330] you.
[00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:57.570] Who
[00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:57.750] has
[00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.890] something
[00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:58.050] they
[00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:58.190] want
[00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.270] to
[00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.710] share,
[00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.910] as
[00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.990] we
[00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.170] say?
[00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.370] Yes,
[00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.590] please.
[00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:00.390] I'll
[00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.550] share
[00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.790] a
[00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:01.010] user
[00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:01.470] innovation
[00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.790] that
[00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.950] I
[00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.170] witnessed
[00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.890] coming
[00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:04.090] up
[00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:04.210] as
[00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:04.310] a
[00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:04.630] child,
[00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.310] and
[00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:05.490] that
[00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:05.670] is
[00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.150] I
[00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.490] grew
[00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:06.610] up
[00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:06.710] in
[00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:07.070] Philadelphia,
[00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:07.330] and
[00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:07.430] we
[00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.550] used
[00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.770] to
[00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:08.310] listen
[00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:08.450] to
[00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.570] a
[00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:08.690] lot
[00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.830] of
[00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:09.290] records
[00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:11.810] on
[00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:12.370] turntables.
[00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.570] And
[00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:13.770] at
[00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:13.950] that
[00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:14.390] time,
[00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:14.670] a
[00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.830] lot
[00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:14.930] of
[00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:15.210] people
[00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:15.610] around
[00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:16.030] my
[00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.270] neighborhood
[00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.770] figured
[00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:16.990] out
[00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.210] as
[00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.390] kids
[00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.690] that
[00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.970] if
[00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:18.210] you
[00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:18.490] took
[00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:18.630] the
[00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.870] record
[00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:19.090] and
[00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:19.310] you
[00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:20.190] manipulated
[00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.590] it,
[00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:20.830] you'd
[00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:20.910] get
[00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:21.130] these
[00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:21.450] scratching
[00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:21.750] sounds.
[00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.270] So
[00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.810] after
[00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.990] a
[00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.130] while,
[00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:24.370] but
[00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:24.510] the
[00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.790] problem
[00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:25.130] was
[00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.310] the
[00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:25.650] needle
[00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:26.630] was
[00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.810] a
[00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:27.450] turntable
[00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:28.030] wasn't
[00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.250] built
[00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:28.410] to
[00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:28.550] do
[00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.770] that,
[00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:28.930] so
[00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:29.090] the
[00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:29.290] needle
[00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:29.490] would
[00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:29.770] skip.
[00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:30.070] Because
[00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:30.230] there
[00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.510] wasn't
[00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.850] enough
[00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:31.870] pressure
[00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:32.430] to
[00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.710] keep
[00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.270] it
[00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.490] steady.
[00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:34.290] So
[00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:34.890] we
[00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:35.030] would
[00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.290] take
[00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:35.470] a
[00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.790] penny
[00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:36.890] and
[00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:37.170] usually
[00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:37.450] take
[00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:37.630] some
[00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.950] tape
[00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:38.350] or
[00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:39.390] even
[00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.850] gum
[00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:40.250] at
[00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:40.350] a
[00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:40.610] particular
[00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:40.850] part,
[00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:41.090] put
[00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:41.190] it
[00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.510] underneath
[00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.730] of
[00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:41.870] it,
[00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:42.130] and
[00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:43.090] it
[00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:43.270] would
[00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.630] actually
[00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:43.850] help
[00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:43.990] the
[00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.190] needle
[00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.430] stay
[00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.710] still.
[00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:44.850] And
[00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:45.110] also,
[00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:45.250] as
[00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:45.370] a
[00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:45.670] problem
[00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.850] as
[00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:46.090] far
[00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:46.310] as
[00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.730] the
[00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.970] record
[00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:47.250] cutting,
[00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:47.830] there
[00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:47.970] was
[00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:48.130] too
[00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:48.310] much
[00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:48.670] friction
[00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:49.090] between
[00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:49.270] the
[00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.470] record
[00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.630] and
[00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.770] the
[00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:50.170] turntable.
[00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.330] So
[00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:50.470] we
[00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.630] put
[00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.850] one
[00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:51.070] record
[00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:51.230] on
[00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.390] top
[00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.450] of
[00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:51.530] the
[00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.730] other.
[00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:52.470] But
[00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.610] of
[00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:52.690] course,
[00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.850] that
[00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.050] messed
[00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:53.190] up
[00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.310] your
[00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:53.590] records
[00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:53.930] over
[00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:54.330] time.
[00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:55.650] Soon,
[00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:56.030] this
[00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.330] whole
[00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:57.270] industry
[00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.730] developed
[00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:58.030] where
[00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.250] they
[00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.530] started
[00:40:58.530 --> 00:40:58.790] making
[00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:59.510] turntables
[00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.770] with
[00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:00.270] weighted
[00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:01.250] needles
[00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.690] so
[00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:03.150] that
[00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.270] you
[00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.430] could
[00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.670] do
[00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.850] this
[00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:04.050] little
[00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:04.430] scratching
[00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.830] sound
[00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:05.090] on
[00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:05.230] it.
[00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.630] You'd
[00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.870] have
[00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:06.210] felt
[00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:06.590] products
[00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:06.730] that
[00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:06.990] came
[00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.290] out
[00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:07.750] that
[00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.870] you
[00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:08.070] put
[00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:08.370] underneath
[00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:08.670] the
[00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.970] record
[00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:09.530] that
[00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.810] allowed
[00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:09.970] it
[00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:10.230] to
[00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.830] go
[00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:11.110] back
[00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:11.250] and
[00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:11.510] forth.
[00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:12.250] And
[00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:12.430] with
[00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.570] the
[00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:12.870] digital
[00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:13.210] era
[00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:14.010] that's
[00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:14.350] arising
[00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:14.690] now,
[00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:14.950] someone
[00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:15.250] told
[00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:15.390] me
[00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.850] recently,
[00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.390] because
[00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.510] there
[00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.550] was
[00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.670] a
[00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.930] problem
[00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:17.150] that
[00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.610] you
[00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:17.790] could
[00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:18.410] manipulate
[00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.950] records
[00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:19.230] this
[00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:19.510] way,
[00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.910] but
[00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:20.050] you
[00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:20.230] couldn't
[00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.450] really
[00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.870] manipulate,
[00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.230] say,
[00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:21.650] CDs.
[00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:22.090] So
[00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:22.350] people
[00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:22.490] would
[00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:22.610] go
[00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:22.750] to
[00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.890] the
[00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:23.130] party,
[00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.330] and
[00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:23.470] you'd
[00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:23.630] have
[00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.770] to
[00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:24.010] take
[00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:24.250] all
[00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:24.430] these
[00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.810] heavy
[00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:25.330] records
[00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.210] up
[00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:26.430] the
[00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:26.910] stairs,
[00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:27.050] or
[00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.190] the
[00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.410] big
[00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.690] speakers,
[00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.910] et
[00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:28.110] cetera.
[00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:28.710] Now
[00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.970] they've
[00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:29.130] come
[00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:29.310] out
[00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:29.430] with
[00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.550] a
[00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:29.890] product,
[00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:30.090] I
[00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:30.430] understand,
[00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.310] that
[00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.750] the
[00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:32.010] needle
[00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:32.430] actually
[00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.630] is
[00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.850] able
[00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:33.110] to
[00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:33.710] read,
[00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:34.710] I
[00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.930] guess,
[00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:35.450] whatever
[00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.710] you
[00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.910] have
[00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:36.070] as
[00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:36.190] far
[00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.270] as
[00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:36.390] your
[00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.710] digital
[00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:37.110] music.
[00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:38.190] So
[00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.310] you
[00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:38.450] can
[00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:38.650] have
[00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:38.890] something
[00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:39.110] like
[00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:39.230] an
[00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.710] iPod
[00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:40.550] device
[00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.310] now,
[00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.570] instead
[00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:41.650] of
[00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:41.850] carrying
[00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:42.010] all
[00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:42.130] these
[00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:42.370] records,
[00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.550] put
[00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.670] it
[00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:43.030] in
[00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.610] some
[00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:43.810] type
[00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:43.910] of
[00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:44.170] storage
[00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:44.630] device.
[00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.790] And
[00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:46.070] then
[00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.330] the
[00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:46.510] needle
[00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.710] will
[00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:47.230] read
[00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.430] off
[00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.570] the
[00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:47.790] storage
[00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:48.130] device
[00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:48.350] off
[00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:48.530] these
[00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.810] two,
[00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:49.190] still
[00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.370] look
[00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:49.550] like
[00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:50.150] turntables.
[00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:50.890] And
[00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:51.230] you
[00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.390] could
[00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.630] do
[00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:51.870] all
[00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:52.030] your
[00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.430] mixing,
[00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.750] et
[00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.850] cetera,
[00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:53.150] at
[00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.150] a
[00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.430] party.
[00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:54.230] And
[00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.550] you
[00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.710] don't
[00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.910] have
[00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:55.030] to
[00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.250] carry
[00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.670] all
[00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.790] the
[00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.110] records.
[00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:56.450] But
[00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.750] again,
[00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:56.930] it's
[00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:57.050] an
[00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.570] innovation
[00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:57.810] that
[00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:58.030] happened
[00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.210] with
[00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:58.390] little
[00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.670] kids,
[00:41:59.130 --> 00:41:59.190] and
[00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.390] it
[00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.910] was
[00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:00.110] very
[00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:00.530] innocent.
[00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:00.690] It
[00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:00.790] was
[00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.930] like,
[00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:01.130] oh,
[00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.290] this
[00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:01.350] is
[00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:01.430] a
[00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.570] cool
[00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:01.790] thing
[00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.930] to
[00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:02.150] do.
[00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:02.490] That
[00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:02.610] is
[00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:02.830] so
[00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:03.090] cool.
[00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:03.610] That's
[00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:03.810] very
[00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:03.990] good.
[00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:04.430] And
[00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.710] I'm
[00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.930] sure
[00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:05.130] the
[00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:05.810] manufacturers
[00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:06.110] would
[00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:06.190] have
[00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.350] looked
[00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:06.510] at
[00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.590] you
[00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:06.670] in
[00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.910] utter
[00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:07.290] horror,
[00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.770] that's
[00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:07.990] not
[00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.190] what
[00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.310] you
[00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:08.450] do
[00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.590] with
[00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:08.710] a
[00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.930] record.
[00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:10.330] Remember,
[00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.470] they
[00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.590] were
[00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:10.790] spending
[00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.990] their
[00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.230] time
[00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.470] saying,
[00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:11.970] here's
[00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:12.110] how
[00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:12.270] you
[00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.830] clean
[00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:13.110] them,
[00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.490] remember?
[00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:15.370] Yeah,
[00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:15.890] that's
[00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:16.090] so
[00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:16.410] cool.
[00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:17.230] Who
[00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.390] else
[00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.490] has
[00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:17.630] got
[00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.850] another
[00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:18.110] one?
[00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:20.110] Anybody?
[00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:21.470] Well,
[00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:21.630] I
[00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:21.750] know
[00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:22.050] he's
[00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:22.190] got
[00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.390] such
[00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.510] a
[00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.810] topper
[00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:23.050] there
[00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:23.210] that
[00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.390] you're
[00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.590] re
[00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:24.990]-evaluating
[00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.470] yours.
[00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.510] Brina.
[00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.490] Brina.
[00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:28.010] I
[00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.610] read
[00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:28.850] about
[00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:29.050] this,
[00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:29.230] but
[00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:29.350] I
[00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:29.530] haven't
[00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:29.810] seen
[00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.930] it
[00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:30.090] yet.
[00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:30.270] But
[00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.450] on
[00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:30.590] the
[00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.010] main
[00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.450] campus,
[00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.910] a
[00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:32.030] lot
[00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.130] of
[00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:32.410] students
[00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:32.630] have
[00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.810] this
[00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:33.090] problem
[00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:33.270] with
[00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.350] you
[00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:33.470] have
[00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.530] to
[00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:33.650] run
[00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.850] up
[00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:33.950] and
[00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:34.190] down
[00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.330] your
[00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:35.770] dorm
[00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:36.050] just
[00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:36.170] to
[00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.250] go
[00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:36.410] get
[00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.570] your
[00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:36.830] laundry
[00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:37.070] back
[00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:37.210] and
[00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:37.370] forth.
[00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.530] And
[00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:37.650] so
[00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:37.790] what
[00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.910] they
[00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:38.130] did
[00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:38.270] was
[00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.410] they
[00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:38.750] wired
[00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.930] up
[00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:39.090] all
[00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:39.210] the
[00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:39.430] laundry
[00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.730] machines
[00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:39.930] and
[00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.270] dryers
[00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.570] to
[00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:41.110] the
[00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:41.370] web.
[00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:41.810] And
[00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:42.010] so
[00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:42.150] what
[00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.230] it
[00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.410] does,
[00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.510] it
[00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:42.730] tells
[00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:42.870] you
[00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:43.030] which
[00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.510] machines
[00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.670] are
[00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:44.070] available
[00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:44.330] or
[00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:44.470] how
[00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.610] many
[00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:44.830] minutes
[00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:44.930] are
[00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:45.330] left.
[00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:45.850] And
[00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:46.110] it'll
[00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:46.410] send
[00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:46.490] you
[00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.570] a
[00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:46.690] message
[00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:46.870] and
[00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.970] say,
[00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:47.150] oh,
[00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:47.290] your
[00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:47.730] laundry's
[00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:47.990] done.
[00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:48.130] So
[00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:48.310] people
[00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:48.570] know
[00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:48.810] exactly
[00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:49.010] when
[00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.090] to
[00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:49.270] run
[00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.530] up
[00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:49.630] and
[00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:49.790] down
[00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.930] the
[00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:50.210] stairs.
[00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.710] So
[00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.870] I
[00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:51.030] think
[00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.190] they're
[00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.270] going
[00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.310] to
[00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:51.450] try
[00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:51.530] to
[00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:52.110] commercialize
[00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:52.250] this.
[00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.350] They're
[00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:52.550] talking
[00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.690] to
[00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:53.130] manufacturers
[00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:53.310] to
[00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:53.790] commercialize
[00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.930] this,
[00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:54.150] but
[00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.510] it
[00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.590] was
[00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:54.710] just
[00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.810] an
[00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:55.110] innovation.
[00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:55.290] They
[00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:55.470] did
[00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.610] it
[00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:55.790] in
[00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.910] the
[00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:56.310] dormitories
[00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:56.530] on
[00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:56.890] the
[00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:57.030] main
[00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.470] campus.
[00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.870] That's
[00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:58.030] so
[00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.250] cool.
[00:42:58.410 --> 00:42:58.470] You
[00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.610] mean
[00:42:58.610 --> 00:42:58.810] some
[00:42:58.810 --> 00:42:59.150] particular
[00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.430] kids
[00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.610] did
[00:42:59.610 --> 00:42:59.910] that?
[00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.310] A
[00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:00.490] couple
[00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:00.590] of
[00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:00.850] students
[00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:01.030] did
[00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.290] that.
[00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.830] That
[00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:03.190] is
[00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.450] so
[00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:03.810] good.
[00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:04.430] That
[00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.570] is
[00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:04.850] so
[00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:05.170] good.
[00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:06.010] Yeah,
[00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:06.290] that's
[00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.730] wonderful.
[00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.670] Yeah,
[00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.890] I'm
[00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:08.130] sure.
[00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:08.430] That
[00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.570] is
[00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:08.750] so
[00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:09.070] great.
[00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.710] Yes.
[00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:11.070] And
[00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:11.270] again,
[00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:11.430] the
[00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.950] manufacturer
[00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:12.230] didn't
[00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.390] do
[00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.570] it.
[00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:13.310] No.
[00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.510] So
[00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.590] they
[00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:13.750] tried
[00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.830] to
[00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:13.910] do
[00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.950] it
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:17.560] at
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:17.560] home
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.000] and
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:18.360] know
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:18.660] exactly
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:18.840] when
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:18.940] to
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.060] go
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:19.320] back
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:19.460] to
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:19.500] the
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:19.620] one
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:19.740] who
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:19.880] managed
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.000] to
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.120] pick
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:20.180] up
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:20.280] their
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:20.460] laundry.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:20.800] It's
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:20.960] a
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:21.360] wonderfully
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:21.660] clever
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:21.900] idea.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.120] Now,
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:22.360] why
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:22.460] do
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:22.600] you
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.160] suppose
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:23.400] that
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:23.560] the
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:23.960] users
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.340] did
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:24.560] it?
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:25.460] Some
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:26.260] students
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:26.660] realized
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:26.800] there
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:26.920] was
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.560] a
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:27.860] need
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.100] for
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:28.240] it
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:28.440] because
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:28.900] they
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:29.340] personally
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:29.600] were
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:29.760] the
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:29.960] ones
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.040] who
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:30.100] had
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:30.180] to
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:30.320] run
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:30.480] up
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:30.560] and
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:30.700] down
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:30.860] the
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:31.160] stairs
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:31.680] to
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:31.800] go
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:31.960] get
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:32.100] their
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:32.420] laundry
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:32.700] or
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.200] had
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:33.340] to
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:33.540] waste
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:33.660] their
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:33.900] time
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:34.180] checking
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:34.340] to
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:34.440] see
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:34.580] if
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:34.680] the
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.020] laundry's
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:35.340] done.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:36.560] Right.
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:36.900] And
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.020] if
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:37.160] the
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:37.400] laundry
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:37.920] sits
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.120] there
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:38.240] for
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:38.300] a
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:38.460] long
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:38.620] period
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:38.720] of
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:38.840] time,
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.040] somebody
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:39.260] might
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:39.500] take
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:39.620] it
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:39.880] out
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.060] and
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:40.180] put
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:40.240] it
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:40.440] somewhere
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:40.880] else,
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.080] and
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:41.220] then
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:41.580] who
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:41.760] knows
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:41.900] what
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:42.360] happens
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:42.540] and
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:42.680] all
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:42.740] the
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:42.860] rest
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:42.940] of
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:43.080] that.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.320] So
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:44.480] in
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:44.620] a
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:44.860] sense,
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:45.160] they
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:45.380] were
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:45.720] high
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.180] need
[00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:47.770] because
[00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:47.970] if
[00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:48.090] you
[00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:48.290] live
[00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.390] in
[00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.510] a
[00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.770] suburban
[00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:49.350] house,
[00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.290] you
[00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:50.450] don't
[00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.590] have
[00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:50.730] that
[00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:51.050] problem.
[00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:53.050] So
[00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:53.370] again,
[00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.610] it's
[00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:53.850] sort
[00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:53.930] of
[00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:54.110] like
[00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:54.830] the
[00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:55.150] police
[00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.410] car
[00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:55.750] thing.
[00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:55.950] It's
[00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:56.070] sort
[00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:56.130] of
[00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:56.250] the
[00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:56.510] high
[00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.890] need
[00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:57.350] people
[00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:57.990] that
[00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.170] start
[00:43:58.170 --> 00:43:58.290] to
[00:43:58.290 --> 00:43:58.410] do
[00:43:58.410 --> 00:43:58.590] something
[00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:58.910] about
[00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:59.110] it.
[00:43:59.550 --> 00:43:59.750] That's
[00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.110] great.
[00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:00.990] Now,
[00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.570] did
[00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:01.950] others
[00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:02.110] of
[00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:02.350] you
[00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.550] not
[00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:03.730] have
[00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:03.910] something
[00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:04.110] that
[00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:04.610] matches
[00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:04.890] up
[00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:04.990] to
[00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.130] these
[00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:05.370] wonderful
[00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:05.570] things,
[00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:05.670] or
[00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.790] you
[00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:06.090] couldn't
[00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:06.330] think
[00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:06.470] of
[00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.750] anything
[00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.910] at
[00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:07.290] all?
[00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.630] Where
[00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.730] do
[00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:08.890] we
[00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:09.310] stand?
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:12.520] Where
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:12.640] do
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:12.820] we
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:13.280] stand?
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.160] Cheng?
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.000] Well,
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.640] as
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:16.760] I
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:16.940] was
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:17.420] discussing
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:17.620] earlier,
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:17.880] one
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.000] thing
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:18.100] I
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:18.280] can
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:18.560] think
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:18.820] about
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:19.040] is
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.520] how
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.200] Cisco
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:20.520] came
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:20.840] about,
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:21.600] which
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:21.760] is
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.100] user
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:22.620] innovation,
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:22.980] where
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:23.420] actually,
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:24.280] as
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:24.380] far
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:24.500] as
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:24.580] I
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:24.800] understand,
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:25.660] during
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:25.880] the
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.360] 80s,
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.140] most
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:27.280] of
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:27.400] the
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:27.780] campus
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.240] within
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:28.660] Stanford
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:28.920] are
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.160] not
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:29.400] linked
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:29.540] to
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:29.700] each
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:29.920] other.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:30.480] But
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:30.660] these
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:31.100] two
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:31.380] PhD
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:31.920] students
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.460] who
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:32.540] are
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:32.860] in
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:33.180] love,
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:33.480] and
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:33.840] they
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.300] decided
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:34.520] to
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:34.900] create
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.140] these
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:35.340] two
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:35.640] black
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:35.920] box
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.380] so
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:36.520] they
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:36.700] can
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:36.960] send
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:37.360] love
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:37.840] message
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.340] to
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:38.500] each
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:38.780] other.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:39.280] And
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:39.480] that's
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:39.600] how
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:39.740] the
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:40.000] Cisco
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:40.300] router
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:40.560] came
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:40.760] about.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:40.980] So
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.160] they
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:41.480] created
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:41.680] that,
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:41.840] and
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:41.920] it
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.100] came
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:42.240] out
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:42.360] in
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:42.500] the
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:42.640] form
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:42.860] Cisco.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:43.300] Is
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:43.480] that
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:43.800] right?
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:44.560] I
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:44.780] didn't
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:45.000] know
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.360] that.
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:45.920] Yeah.
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:46.260] But
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:46.420] that
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:46.540] would
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:46.720] be
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.320] absolutely
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:47.780] a
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:47.960] user
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:48.260] innovation.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:48.980] Does
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:49.180] anybody
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:49.360] else
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:49.460] know
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:49.640] about
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:49.800] that
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.020] one?
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.160] Or
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.860] can
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.460] corroborate?
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.060] OK,
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:53.620] so
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.260] Rodan,
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:54.700] what
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:54.840] about
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.060] you?
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:55.360] Got
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:55.480] any
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:55.700] ideas?
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:56.660] The
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:56.980] example
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:57.160] that
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:57.220] I
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:57.300] have
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:57.420] is
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:57.540] a
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:57.740] bit
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.400] technical
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:44:59.640] or
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.160] convoluted,
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:00.360] so
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:00.540] I'll
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:00.700] try
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:00.840] my
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.100] best
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:01.260] to
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:01.600] explain
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:01.820] it.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:02.860] I
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:03.060] work
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.220] for
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:03.460] Lucent
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:03.980] Technologies,
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:04.240] and
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:04.360] we
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:04.620] had
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.000] invented
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:06.280] a
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:06.660] device
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:06.900] which
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:07.080] would
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:07.300] take
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:07.820] multiple
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:08.220] wavelengths
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:08.740] of
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:09.080] light
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.040] and
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:10.600] multiplex
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:10.780] it
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:11.000] into
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:11.280] one
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:11.600] fiber.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:12.360] This
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:12.480] is
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:12.660] called
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:13.360] DWDM,
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:13.600] Dense
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:13.920] Wavelength
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.200] Division
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:14.840] Multiplexing.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:15.380] The
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:15.620] problem
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:15.860] was
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:16.180] making
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:16.460] these
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.040] devices,
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.200] the
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:18.580] operators
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:19.080] had
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:19.260] to
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:19.460] deal
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:19.680] with
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.300] many
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:20.640] different
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.000] channels
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:21.200] of
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:21.440] light,
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:21.760] putting
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:21.900] it
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:22.100] in
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:22.220] and
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:22.460] taking
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:22.640] it
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:22.800] out.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.000] And
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.580] the
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:23.720] thing
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:23.880] was
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.000] a
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:24.100] bit
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:24.500] finicky.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:24.740] So
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:25.060] depending
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:25.240] on
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:25.380] how
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:25.540] you
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:25.740] put
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:25.880] in
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:26.080] the
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:26.880] fiber
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.440] connectors,
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:28.160] you
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:28.300] would
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:28.440] get
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:28.560] a
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:28.800] different
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.240] readout
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:29.640] as
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:29.860] to
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:30.100] what
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:30.220] is
[00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:30.360] the
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:30.840] attenuation
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.260] or
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:31.440] what
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:31.580] is
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:31.820] the
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:32.320] optical
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:32.680] loss
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:32.880] going
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.060] through
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:33.300] this
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:33.640] device.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:34.120] So
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:34.260] they
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:34.420] ended
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:34.600] up
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:34.760] just
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.020] cutting
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:35.260] off
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:35.420] the
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:35.720] connectors
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:35.940] and
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:36.160] using
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:36.320] the
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:36.500] bare
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:36.880] fiber
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.580] and
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:37.820] putting
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.000] it
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:38.120] in
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:38.300] the
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:38.660] test
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:39.060] device.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:40.900] Our
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:41.380] manufacturer
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:41.640] of
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:41.800] the
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.040] test
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:42.420] instrument
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.000] realized
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:43.320] that
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:43.820] we're
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:44.220] just
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:44.660] cutting
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:44.900] these
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:45.260] connectors
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:45.460] and
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:45.620] then
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:46.380] reconnectorizing
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:46.520] it
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:46.640] at
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:46.780] the
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:46.980] end.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:47.820] So
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.040] they
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.740] modified
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:49.240] their
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:49.620] equipment
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:49.960] to
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.160] be
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:50.320] able
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:50.480] to
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:50.860] accommodate
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:51.820] our
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:52.100] needs
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:52.280] and
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:52.500] just
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:52.880] accept
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.140] bare
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:53.460] fiber
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.440] instead
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:54.480] of
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:54.780] the
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.420] optical
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.480] connectors.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.160] OK.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:58.180] And
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:58.360] did
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:58.500] you
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:58.640] in
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.000]-house
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:45:59.320] sort
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:45:59.420] of
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:45:59.740] use
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.100] the
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:00.480] initially?
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:01.440] So
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:01.740] you
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.200] were
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:02.500] chopping
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:02.700] it
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:02.860] off
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:02.940] in
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.040] the
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:03.320] field,
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:03.580] I
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:03.840] guess.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:04.360] We're
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:04.620] chopping
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:04.820] it
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:05.000] up
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.360] when
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:05.500] we
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:05.640] were
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.180] manufacturing
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:06.340] it.
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:06.440] Oh,
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:06.540] when
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:06.680] you're
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:06.780] manufacturing
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:06.780] it.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.120] So
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:07.440] imagine
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:07.640] the
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:07.980] connectors
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.220] at
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:08.340] the
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:08.460] end
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:08.580] of
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:08.760] this.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.140] Instead
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:09.320] of
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:09.560] having
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:09.900] to
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.480] twist
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:10.680] the
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:10.820] thing,
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:11.440] shoving
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.320] it
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:12.540] in,
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:12.820] we
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:12.980] just
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:13.200] used
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:13.340] the
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:13.600] wire.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.240] Right.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:14.700] Now,
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.040] so
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:15.400] did
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:15.640] you
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:16.100] modify
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:16.380] their
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:16.780] equipment
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:17.120] for
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:17.300] your
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:17.460] own
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:17.720] purposes?
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:18.000] Yes,
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:18.460] exactly.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:18.900] OK.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:19.100] So
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:19.380] first
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:19.660] you
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:20.120] modified
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:20.320] it
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:20.440] as
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:20.780] users.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:21.200] Right.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:21.940] Perfect
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:22.420] example
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:22.680] then.
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:23.320] Yes.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:23.580] Because
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:23.720] it
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:23.880] wasn't
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.060] just
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:24.220] that
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:24.300] you
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:24.540] sat
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:24.720] there
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:24.840] and
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.040] thought,
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:25.340] god,
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:25.460] you
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:25.660] guys,
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:25.740] you
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:25.900] really
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:26.000] ought

[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:26.980] You
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:27.180] actually
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:27.380] just
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:27.540] went
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:27.660] ahead
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:27.800] and
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:27.920] did
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.100] it.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:28.380] Right.
[00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:29.270] And
[00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.370] then
[00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:29.490] the
[00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:29.890] manufacturer

[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:17.720] fits
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:17.920] the

[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:23.020] exercise
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:23.620] program?
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:24.200] It's
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:24.440] like
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:24.700] the
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:24.860] one
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:25.080] that
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:25.380] comes

[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:33.900] I
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:34.160] think
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:34.340] it
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:34.640] comes
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:34.860] from

[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:37.660] Billy
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:38.000] Blank.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.120] Maybe
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:39.380] he's
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:39.580] not
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:39.980] satisfied
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:40.240] with
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:40.980] each
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:41.380] program
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:41.920] separately,
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:42.240] so
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:42.420] he
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:42.960] combined
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.900] all
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:44.060] the

[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:44.740] together
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:44.940] and
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:45.320] created
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:45.520] an

[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:46.500] program
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:46.820] that
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.300] helped
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:48.940] reduce
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:49.300] weight
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:49.580] and

[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:52.460] something
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:52.700] like
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:52.880] that.
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:53.100] And
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:53.260] he
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:53.920] commercialized
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:54.260] that.
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:54.960] And
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.180] he
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:55.680] kept
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.340] adding
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.060] minor
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:57.760] adjustments.
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:58.700] In
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.420] 2004
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:47:59.800] program,
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:47:59.980] he
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:00.360] added
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.000] the
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:01.500] resistance
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.080] ball
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:02.520] to
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:02.700] the
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:02.940] program
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.180] and
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:03.580] resell
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:03.700] it
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:03.940] again,
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:04.260] something
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:04.520] like
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:04.700] that.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.240] OK.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:05.920] So
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.380] that's
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:06.480] a
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:06.580] good
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:06.760] one
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:06.860] in

[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.340] What
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:09.560] we're
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:09.920] after
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.280] here

[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.260] firm
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:14.580] doing
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:14.840] it.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:16.220] And
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:16.400] so
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:16.620] what
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:16.800] you've
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:16.960] got
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.140] there
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:17.280] is
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:17.480] maybe
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:17.660] that
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:17.880] person
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.000] had
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.100] a
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:18.500] combined
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:19.020] motivation.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:19.180] You
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:19.340] wanted
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:19.520] to
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:19.720] sell
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:19.840] it
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:20.000] as
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:20.280] well,
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:20.940] right?
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:21.500] Yeah.
[00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.930] Yeah.
[00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:24.810] Now,
[00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.690] that
[00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:25.830] would
[00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:26.010] still
[00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:26.130] be
[00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:26.250] a
[00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:26.410] user
[00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:26.810] innovation

[00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.770] of
[00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.890] the
[00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:28.310] motivation
[00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:28.590] came
[00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:29.090] afterwards.
[00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.530] But
[00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:30.650] in
[00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.910] any
[00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:31.210] case,
[00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:31.390] for
[00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.690] us
[00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:32.470] conceptually,
[00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:32.690] the
[00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:33.090] idea
[00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:33.450] is
[00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:33.830] that
[00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:34.290] probably
[00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:34.610] that
[00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:35.010] person
[00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:35.230] had

[00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.750] actually
[00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:36.210] doing
[00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:36.510] it
[00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:37.470] to

[00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:39.110] was
[00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:39.570] wanted.
[00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:40.550] Rather
[00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.790] than
[00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.970] doing
[00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:41.190] a
[00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.570] survey

[00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:44.650] the
[00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:45.110] idea
[00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:45.550] that
[00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:45.710] this
[00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.830] is
[00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:45.970] what
[00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:46.190] I
[00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.510] need.
[00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:47.850] And
[00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:47.990] as
[00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.130] we'll

[00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:48.770] go
[00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:48.990] on
[00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.250] later,
[00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:49.830] this
[00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:49.950] is
[00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:50.090] a

[00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:53.870] works.
[00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.390] It's
[00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.630] because
[00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.850] you
[00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:55.350] yourself
[00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:55.550] have

[00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:58.010] want
[00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.570] than
[00:48:58.570 --> 00:48:58.670] you

[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:42.720] general
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.000] instant
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:43.420] messaging.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:44.800] And
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:44.920] then
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:45.420] other
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:45.980] universities
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:46.500] adopted
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:46.700] it.
[00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:48.330] And
[00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:48.510] then
[00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:49.170] finally,
[00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:49.610] a
[00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:49.890] firm
[00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:50.230] started
[00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.390] to
[00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.910] commercialize
[00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.990] it.
[00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.150] Now
[00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.690] notice,
[00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:52.310] again,
[00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:52.750] these
[00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:53.230] time
[00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:53.830] lags.
[00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.610] 10
[00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:55.970] years.
[00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:56.590] If
[00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:56.790] we
[00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:57.090] have
[00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:57.370] some
[00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:57.850] efficient
[00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:58.390] way
[00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:59.750] to
[00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:00.430] identify
[00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.070] user
[00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:01.570] innovation
[00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:03.090] instead
[00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:03.690] of
[00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:03.950] just
[00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:04.330] standing
[00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:04.630] there
[00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.830] and
[00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:05.150] waiting
[00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.490] for
[00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:05.650] it
[00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:05.810] to
[00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:06.230] grow
[00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.570] and
[00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:06.870] finally
[00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:07.170] beat
[00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:07.370] down
[00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.530] the
[00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:07.890] doors,
[00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.750] then
[00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.890] we
[00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:10.030] will
[00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.170] have
[00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:10.510] developed
[00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:10.690] an
[00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:11.050] innovation
[00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:11.630] system
[00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:12.170] that
[00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.370] can
[00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:12.930] capture
[00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:14.090] the
[00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:14.330] real
[00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:14.690] source
[00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:14.850] of
[00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:15.130] major
[00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:15.570] innovations.
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:18.620] So
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.220] there's
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:19.440] plenty
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:19.600] of
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:19.800] room
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:19.900] in
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:20.100] there,
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:20.400] again,
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:20.560] with
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:20.720] that
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.000] time
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:21.320] lag.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:23.720] And
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.060] again,
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:25.540] incentive
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.060] story
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:26.460] here.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:27.400] It's
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:27.540] so
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:27.680] cool.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:27.800] Do
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:27.840] you
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:27.940] know
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.080] what
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:28.300] Wi
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:28.360]-Fi
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:28.760] is?
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:29.600] Don't
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:29.780] you?
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:30.100] Right?
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:30.840] You
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.080] go
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:31.240] down
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:31.360] to
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:31.460] your
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:31.680] local
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:31.980] cafe
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:32.300] and
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:32.560] you
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.200] can
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:33.580] use
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:33.800] Wi
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.020]-Fi,
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:34.220] and
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:34.320] so
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:34.460] you
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:34.600] can
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.160] wire,
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.040] in
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:36.200] fact,
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:36.360] you've
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:36.500] probably
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:36.620] got
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:36.820] Wi
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:36.920]-Fi
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:37.140] right
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:37.300] now
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:37.400] and
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:37.480] you're
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:37.620] doing
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:37.760] your
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:38.020] email.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:38.600] Who
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:38.860] knows?
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:42.780] Well,
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.140] users
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:43.480] did
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:43.780] that.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:46.180] There's
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:46.340] this
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:46.860] guy,
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:47.580] as
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:47.680] the
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:47.900] story
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:48.080] goes,
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:48.200] I
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:48.300] don't
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:48.420] know
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:48.560] this
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:48.760] story
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.160] firsthand,
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:49.340] but
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:49.940] secondhand,
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:50.700] there
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:50.800] was
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:50.940] this
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:51.240] guy
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:51.400] who
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:51.580] knew
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:51.840] about
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.200] antenna
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:52.780] engineering.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:53.660] And
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:53.780] so
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:53.940] they
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.120] had
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:54.300] these
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:54.560] little
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.160] wireless
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:55.980] pods
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:56.160] you
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:56.280] can
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:56.460] use
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:56.560] in
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:56.680] your
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:56.980] house.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:57.520] Some
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:57.640] of
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:57.720] you
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:57.920] probably
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.080] have
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:58.240] those
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:58.560] wireless
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:58.980] network
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:50:59.720] thingies.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.180] And
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:01.280] he
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:01.600] noticed
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:01.820] that
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:01.920] if
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.020] he
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:02.160] put
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:02.300] a
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:02.680] Pringles
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.000] can
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.180] on
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:03.360] this
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:03.520] thing,
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:03.680] which
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:03.760] is
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:03.900] made
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:04.020] out
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:04.160] of
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:04.440] foil,
[00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:06.170] it
[00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.590] was
[00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:06.670] a
[00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:06.810] much
[00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:07.070] better
[00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:07.430] antenna.
[00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:08.710] So
[00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.850] he
[00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:08.990] would
[00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.210] put
[00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:09.590] Pringles
[00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:09.930] cans
[00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:10.110] on
[00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:10.250] those
[00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.450] little
[00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:10.670] ears
[00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.930] sticking
[00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:11.170] up,
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.060] and
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:12.200] then
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:12.300] he
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:12.400] could
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:12.520] go
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:12.800] down
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:12.960] to
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.100] his
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:13.420] local
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:13.840] internet
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:14.220] cafe
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:14.900] and
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:15.120] sit
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:15.300] there
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:15.480] and
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:15.620] do
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:15.840] his
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:16.140] work.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:17.640] Then
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:17.720] he
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:17.980] noticed
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:18.140] that
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:18.360] other
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:18.800] people,
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:18.960] he
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.120] told
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:19.260] his
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:19.480] chums,
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:19.580] and
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:19.800] everybody
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:20.060] started
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:20.320] using
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:20.520] this
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:20.660] thing,
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:20.760] and
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:20.800] it
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:20.920] didn't
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.140] bother
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:21.560] him.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:22.020] They
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:22.120] were
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:22.440] going
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:22.660] through
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:22.940] his
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:23.320] drop,
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:23.760] but
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:23.860] he
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:24.040] didn't
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:24.300] care.
[00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:25.490] And
[00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.590] it
[00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:26.070] became
[00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:26.310] the
[00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:26.530] first
[00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:26.710] sort
[00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.790] of
[00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:27.350] hotspot.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:28.920] So
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.080] then
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:29.480] users
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:29.760] started
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:29.940] to
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.200] modify
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:30.480] these
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:30.840] antennas.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:31.000] They
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:31.180] got
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:31.520] beyond
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.040] Pringles
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:32.440] cans
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:32.620] to
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:32.880] things
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.040] that
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.200] would
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:33.460] reach
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:33.600] out
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:33.760] a
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:33.980] mile
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:34.160] or
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:34.440] so.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:35.760] And
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.340] widespread
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.200] implementation
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:37.680] occurred.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.280] Travelers
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:38.540] find
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.080] hotspots
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:39.240] as
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:39.380] they
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:39.780] travel.
[00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:41.250] And
[00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:41.450] the
[00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:41.950] fascinating
[00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:42.430] thing
[00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:42.670] here
[00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:43.130] was
[00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.630] that
[00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.790] this
[00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:43.930] was
[00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:44.170] starting
[00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:44.370] to
[00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:44.710] happen.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:47.360] And
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:47.560] I
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:47.740] was
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:48.140] traveling
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.420] with
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:48.560] a
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:48.880] guy
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.080] from
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:50.560] a
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.580] telecom
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.020] company,
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:53.740] and
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:54.380] we
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:54.460] were
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:54.700] talking
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:54.880] about
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.080] Wi
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:55.360]-Fi.
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:55.960] And
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.000] he
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:56.180] said,
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:56.380] oh,
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:56.500] it'll
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:56.720] never
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.060] happen.
[00:51:58.610 --> 00:51:58.810] He
[00:51:58.810 --> 00:51:58.930] said,
[00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:59.090] it's
[00:51:59.090 --> 00:51:59.370] not
[00:51:59.370 --> 00:51:59.930] reliable.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:01.340] And
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:01.660] also,
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:01.940] there's
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:02.120] no
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:02.680] security.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:04.200] I
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:04.200] said,
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:04.480] oh,
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:04.780] OK,
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:04.940] I
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:05.160] see.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:05.920] Besides,
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:06.120] he
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:06.300] said,
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:06.460] they're
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:06.740] stealing
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:07.240] services.
[00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:09.830] And
[00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:09.930] he
[00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:10.090] said,
[00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.210] we
[00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:10.310] were
[00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:10.570] driving
[00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:10.750] down
[00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.890] the
[00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:11.210] Caramel
[00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:11.690] Highway
[00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.930] on
[00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:12.190] the
[00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:13.010] coast.
[00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.530] He
[00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:13.630] said,
[00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:13.930] excuse
[00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:14.090] me
[00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:14.170] a
[00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:14.170] minute.
[00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.330] I've
[00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:14.370] got
[00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:14.450] to
[00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.570] pull
[00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:14.670] to
[00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.810] the
[00:52:14.810 --> 00:52:15.130] side.
[00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:15.710] Why
[00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.830] is
[00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:15.950] that?
[00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.070] Oh,
[00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:16.150] I've
[00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.210] got
[00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:16.290] to
[00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:16.370] do
[00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.550] my
[00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:16.770] email.
[00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.930] I
[00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:17.030] know
[00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.210] there's
[00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.310] a
[00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:17.690] hotspot
[00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.910] over
[00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:18.190] here.
[00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:18.910] So
[00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:19.630] he
[00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:22.450] was
[00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:23.690] perfectly
[00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:24.210] busy
[00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:24.890] doing
[00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:25.070] his
[00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:25.330] email.
[00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.490] He
[00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.590] was
[00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:25.790] all
[00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:26.110] happy
[00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:26.270] and
[00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.490] done.
[00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:26.630] And
[00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.750] he
[00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.890] said,
[00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.990] but
[00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.150] there'll
[00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.390] never
[00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.530] be
[00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.650] a
[00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.870] need.
[00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.670] So
[00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:30.190] one
[00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.290] of
[00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.410] the
[00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:30.590] things
[00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:30.810] you'll
[00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:31.030] see
[00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.390] again
[00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.790] is
[00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:32.410] not
[00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:32.670] only
[00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:32.830] to
[00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:33.150] get
[00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.370] the
[00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:33.670] cool
[00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:34.210] idea,
[00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:35.390] but
[00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.910] somehow
[00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:36.270] to
[00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.610] get
[00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:36.750] it
[00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.970] through
[00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:37.210] the
[00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:37.570] filters
[00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:37.790] in
[00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.930] your
[00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:38.330] company
[00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:39.330] to
[00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:39.750] be
[00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:40.030] able
[00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.330] to
[00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:40.830] actually
[00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:41.790] implement
[00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:42.370] effectively.
